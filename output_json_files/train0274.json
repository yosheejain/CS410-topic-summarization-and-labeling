        "transcript": "[Music] hello youtube my name is nero and today we have another episode of chem strike saturday which of course is the weekly series here on my channel where subscribers send me and chem strikes this was sent in by a guy named nate dog right now nate dog has been on a few other episodes of chem strikes saturday and it's kind of difficult it really speaks to him that i can remember his channel because so many people have sent in different stuff for chem strike saturday i think we're like 50 or 60 episodes in the chem strike saturday or so now can we do usually three every single week occasionally we won't do three one two two depends on what is sent in that week but for the most part we do three episodes of chemistry saturday every single week and it's kind of hard to remember everyone's channels right but nate dawg i remember specifically because you go over to his channel he has a bunch of videos of him having guns made out of legos like he has a bunch of awesome lego guns like a honey badger or an m4 carbine or a p226 pistol he's got a bunch of cool stuff on his channel and that's why i remembered him when he sent in the gameplay and i looked at the channel of the person and sent me the gameplay i'm like i remember you you have the cool lego stuff yeah so nate dawg shout out to you so what's what's the dog doing this game place we're playing a bit of drop zone we're playing it on the map octane we're running around the link sniper rifle running around with that lynx acog snipe rifle which to me makes the game play a bit better you know sniper well okay let's don't get me wrong here sniper chem strikes are always impressive it's always impressive no matter what game you're playing what game mode you're doing anything if you're using a sniper and you go on a 24 or 25 kill streak it's impressive to me you know it's definitely awesome but the fact that he's doing it with acog makes it twice as impressive to me so basically with the the talk about the strategy of the game play he's basically just kind of running to the drop zone and taking out people that's what he does but i want to talk about acog for a moment if i may so i like to snipe you know i don't snipe a lot you people i think when people think of me as a youtuber you don't think of me as a sniper and i can definitely understand that i don't snipe very often but alone in my own game place i design for fun and i don't usually do that well while i do it uh i usually just do it for fun regardless and uh because i'm not doing well why snipe you don't really see too many videos of me sniping except maybe in some of your games uh call of duty 4 and world of war i'm pretty good at sniping in those games and i can control the map with a sniper rifle pretty well i think i've got some m40 cod 4 game play that's one recently but for the most part i don't snipe a whole lot at least here on my channel but i will say this i've been sniping since 2007 i've tried out in every game and i try out the acog in every single game right it's bad a lot of people like the acog i don't understand it so the last time to me the acog was good was in call of duty 4 and if you use it on the m40 sniper rifle in that game it actually gave the sniper a damage buff to the point where you could one shot somebody while shooting them in the foot as long as the eight car as long as the m40 had the acog attachment that's how it worked it was a weird glitch that never seemed to get patched so it was good i kind of got used to it so i realized how good that damage buff was and so i kind of used the idea of using acog on the m40 and called a4 but every game since then excluding world of war because they had no acog for the sniper rifle in that game i've tried out the acog and i just can't do well with it i i i'm way better with a regular scope than i am with the acog i just don't understand how people can use acog and if i were to make a like a top 10 which i need to make more top 10s i'm going to be getting on that there'll be more top 10s coming your way pretty soon but if i were to make a top 10 worst attachments i think the acog will be one of if not the worst attachment to me in call of duty because the only time it's ever really a viable option is like the sniper rifles even then it's not that good on the sniper rifles so i still understand how people use acog i don't understand it but there's a lot of you that do let me know in the comments what you guys think about acog are you guys a cog fans i don't know i mean me it's probably the worst attachment in my eyes i don't see how anyone could possibly like the acog it just it seems weird it just seems weird to me almost as weird to me as the idea of drop zone chem strikes all right so what we got going on here man we were talking about the chem strike a little bit towards the game but for the most part we're kind of just like straying away from the gameplay but the gameplay itself man he's on this long kill streak he's kind of taken over uh this hotel i think this is called the hotel in this map i get my callouts mixed up sometimes but he's hanging out here he's on the kill streak and they have a helicopter in the air so he's kind of forced to stick around in here right and the thing about this counter strike is and it's always kind of bobbled me even going back to my warfare 3 trying to get moabs in that game when people do that this well while playing they get the game mode drop zone i understand how that ends up working because in drop zone people are constantly moving he's using a sniper rifle in drop zone which is what a lot of people do the reason people kind of go to drop zone i think the only reason drop zone really has any kind of real relevance uh within the call of duty community is the fact that so many people are moving all the time that actually becomes very easy to get montage clips i know that's why i played it a lot during my warfare 3. i know that's why i play it occasionally here in call of duty ghost is because you kind of want to get montage clips that's kind of how it goes because so many people are moving all the time and i find that it's kind of a damned if you do damn if you want kind of a double-edged sword playing drop zone because if people are constantly moving there's constant action that's definitely a cool thing you can try and get clips but you actually get chem strike right there it's also kind of difficult because people are constantly moving and constantly spawning around you that's you can do everything right and occasionally you'll just get a bad spawn this one will take you out or you'll get knocked off your killstreak somehow someway people are constantly moving so if you see somebody that does well like this and drop zone they had a fantastic game and to you mr nate dawg that's a fantastic game if we skip forward here to the end of the gameplay we will see that he went 50 and 10 which is just an amazing score especially for using a sniper rifle i would be impressed to see somebody go 50 and 10 especially in something like drop zone if they were using a honey badger if they're using a remington r5 or a vector or whatever gun you want but for someone to do that while running around with a golden snipe rifle with the acog scope of all things that's pretty impressive i hope you guys all enjoyed this week's episode of counter-strike saturday and if you did please be sure to read where you guys feel that he deserves if you guys think of sending your guys counter strikes for next week's episode of camera strike saturday everything you guys need to see is on your screen right now everything you guys need to see right here no commentary no color correction try and render the video add a great quality there were so many videos had to get turned down this week including like a double pistol cam strike and some awesome pc gameplay just because the quality was so bad it was just awful quality yeah i'm probably gonna make a tutorial here in the future but yeah try and run the video by good quality upload to youtube as unlisted link me a personal message here on youtube and there you go you've submitted your video for chemistry saturday if you decide to go ahead and check out nate dog like i said he's been on a few episodes of chem strike saturday before if you haven't checked out his channel already i highly suggest it because he has a bunch of quality ghost game play on his channel but the cool thing is he's got some lego videos on his channel he has a fully constructed lego honey badger from cod ghost a fully constructed m4 carbine from cod4 he's got the l115 sniper rifle he's got a bunch of different lego guns on his channel so if that's something that could possibly interest you you guys go ahead and check them out these aren't just stupid looking little guns right these are actually like really awesome well put together uh gun replicas made out of legos he's got some cool stuff on his channel so i hope you guys all enjoyed this week's episode come straight saturday and if you did please be sure the rating hope guys all have a wonderful day [Music] you"

love your content how can I support well the best way to support me honestly is just keep watching and share the videos with your friends however some of you have kind of wanted to go above and beyond that particular type of support and you can do that so just look down in the description you'll find a few different ways to help support me here and allow me to continue to bring you the content that you guys are demanding from me so with that out of the way let's go ahead and talk about today's review topic and that is the ragent tech themus Evo air cooler I don't know a whole lot about it in fact I don't even know if I'm saying the name right we're going to take a look at this see how it Stacks up how it performs and whether or not it's something you should even be considering looking [Music] at get 10% off anything from Cooler Master at the CM store see the description for details all right so product Dimensions let's go ahead and talk about the size of the cooler to see if you can even fit this in your case it's 122 mm x 82 mm by 165 mm tall so if you're putting this in a small form factor a micro ITX build or or a mini ITX build or a Micro ATX build depending on the case you go with you're going to want to make sure there's plenty of height for that this is not a lowprofile cooler it does come with a 120 mm fan rating 1,00 to 18800 R PM it measures 78.8 CFM of air flow that's a lot of air flow the fan also features 3.22 millimet of H2O static pressure that's a lot of pressure obviously it's at 1,800 RPMs life expectancy is 40,000 hours and the noise level is 27.8 6 DB at Max I I'm going to call Shenanigans on that number because I've yet to come across any fan that has ever hit its its DB decimal rating that's a whole another video when it comes to to companies in the way that they rate their fan Noise Okay so inside the box right on the top there is all of your Hardware here and this does support all of your various socket types uh all your common sockets fm1 fm2 fm2 plus am2 am3 am3 plus and all of your Intel sockets so this is going to work with pretty much any modern CPU that you build now there's not a whole lot going on inside the Box uh you do have some product manual here you are going to want to look at this to make sure you install it correctly because after all we all are talking about the cooling of your CPU it's kind of a big deal let's go Ahad and talk about the fan this is 122 mm x 25 mm Dimension it has a sleeve cable kudos for that you guys know how I feel about fan manufacturers that do not include sleeving it cost a couple of cents and it just really improves the looks of it and it is a 4 pin pwm so it is going to ramp up and Slow Down based on the load on your CPU now the actual fan blades on this are very aggressive they have a very aggressive angle which is how they're able to get that massive static pressure on there uh but again this could also create quite a bit of Blade noise at you know higher RPM speeds so we'll be checking that when we do our review of this it moves a ton of air just spinning it by hand I feel so much air coming off the back of this fan can't wait to see how it actually sounds now let's go ahead and talk about the the meat of this review and that is the actual cooling tower itself and here it is the entire Tower is a um kind of a nickel plated Tower so it's going to look really good it's got a ton of actual cooling blades on here and it has four copper heat pipes nickel plated copper heat pipes that are sanded down and you can see the actual copper is exposed when it comes to the block itself or the actual heat sink contact point with your heat spreader now it's no not a whole lot to talk about on this I mean the the blades feel solid they do have uh they're nice and straight They're Not Bent um they do attract fingerprints so you want to keep that in mind you can see right through the thing so let's go ahead and get this in the test bench and let's compare and see how it does on my overclocked 4670k and we'll go ahead and talk about whether or not uh this is a buy and something you should consider taking a look at from this brand new company ragent dech I think that's how you say it I'm honestly not sure hey guys so before I could even start talking about temperatures on this I ran into a problem that's actually really common and many of you have probably experienced yourself where the fan was actually hitting the RAM on my test bench now this isn't a big deal if you have standard height Ram or Ram that doesn't have a tall heat sink on it or heat spreader like my ad dat RAM does so it may not even be an issue for you so in my case the fan was striking the RAM and what I had to do was I had to instead of doing a push configuration which would be desired on a heat sink Tower like this I had to go into a pull configuration by putting the fan on the opposite side I don't feel that that is the most optimal fan setting for a heat sink uh Tower like this where it's air cooled so I just want you to be mindful of that while we're talking about the temperatures here moving forward okay first things first the installation is really simple the back plate fits all of your sockets you have one back plate for everything the fan mounts with these little rubber tabs that just kind of hook onto the heat sink so it's really simple now when it comes to the temperatures I don't really think there's anything surprising here when it comes to stock voltage stock clocks this thing kept the CPU nice and cool in the mid to Upper 60s and had absolutely no problem maintaining that temperature with a low fan speed no issues at all but as soon as I started bumping More Voltage to it and started reaching that 1.27 to 1.3 Volt range for the CPU which is what's required for my chip to get its 4.4 gig overclock I started seeing temperatures go all the way up into the 90s so this cooler is definitely not up to the task when it comes to cooling down that much voltage now there could be a couple of reasons for this one it could be because the actual block is not very smooth it's kind of rough uh it just usually better temperatures come from a lapped service which is polished and glassy smooth so that you don't get any crevices and things for there to be you know micro gaps which really do affect temperatures and also good just because of the fact that there's only four heat pipes in this particular cooler now this cooler is going to be very similar to like The Cooler Master hyper 212 so the performance here is pretty much on par with what I've experienced with that cooler in various builds that I've done now I don't talk about costs cuz I have honestly no idea how much this thing costs so I can't really talk about that but tell me what you think about this cooler what I think it looks pretty awesome I like the design it looks really good it was easy to install but you may have compatibility issues with your RAM and definitely you have to make sure that you can accommodate the height of this cooler so guys go ahead and sound off in the comments and tell me what you think what cooler are you using if you're air Cooling and why help everyone else make a informed decision on what to buy for their computers I'm going to get the hell on out of here guys I've got a huge announcement coming up here in the future and I can't wait to tell you guys about it but it's a little bit premature so we won't even go there yet as always guys I'll see you in my next [Music] [Music] video"

        "transcript": "hello youtube dog49 here and welcome to another fifa 13 player review and today we're looking at nathan del fonzo from blackpool and he's english and let's look at his stats on his card first of all so he's got 90 pace 64 shooting 49 passing 77 dribbling 33 defending which doesn't really matter because he's a striker and 70 heading so his key starts as you can see are 90 acceleration 90 sprint speed and then what's this you go it goes into the 70s and even into the 60s well this is one of the things when we're talking about today but anyway let's carry on finishing 75 ball control 76 agility 75 dribbling at 78 stream 72 heading 69 and he's got a three star weak film and three star skills moves and his price is about 4987 on the playstation on the xbox it's a bit more expensive for a change and at six thousand and thirty six coins and then on the pc he is worth three thousand nine hundred and eight so it seems to be like reverse order for his price today so let's go to some game plan i'll discuss why i think he's actually quite a good player so now we're onto the gameplay um we're going to be talking about why i think he's quite an underrated player so as you can see from starts they aren't that great technically but the way i seem to play him i don't know whether it was just me or just seems to be that he's quite underrated and his skills like it match up well together and work well together but he seems to be quite a good player i must say um for instance it says that his agility and dribbling and strength a quiet middle of the parkway i'd say he's one of the strongest um and best on the ball strikers i've ever had it's a bit like a mix between balotelli for strength and eto for his dribbling except he hasn't got m skill moves obviously which is a bit of a minus but it doesn't matter also his price is really really good for his silver striker and obviously hasn't got five star weak foot which like other strikers like beckford has but that's still quite cheap for a silver striker who's 71 and shiny and that shininess on the silver player seems to attract quite a few people to him and so i don't i think that's why his price gone up but if these people didn't know his in-game stats i think they won't buy him but even though he's in games that's not very good he seems really good for instance as you can see from some of his goals i haven't put this straight in this um starting there but his long shots are really quite good as well especially his fin is finishing ours is as well his finishing is really quite good inside the box it says only 75 but it seems for eight out of ten probably even nine out of ten um shots going from inside the box but that's from any angle as well so some of those shots from like obscure angles and acute angles and angles which you won't even think were imaginable and i'm not i don't mean um near post um at all i just mean like any angle in particular he seems to be getting those goals away it seems to be quite good he's really good at doing that so i've been really enjoying him and playing with him and also his speed does really help now i must say his attacking work rate is low and that can be a bit annoying and his weak foot is really quite annoying sometimes but it's manageable but i'm still probably going to put it down as minus because you really want those guys to be having four or five weeks for especially if uh um only got a strike because you want to maybe get them into good positions so anyway let's move over on to the overall like rating of this player so nathan delfonzo i've given eight out of ten and his pluses are is good speed as i said about is acceleration and sprint speed both 90. that's absolutely brilliant for a striker um he's really underrated and that's really good as well because he's cheap and by what i mean by underrated is his stats are um like not as good as they feel and he is quite cheap as well so that makes him underrated and also because of his good mix of like dribbling and strength and he can keep the ball quite well he's got good ball control as well so it's really good as well but one thing which does let him down and which does drop a couple of marks on him is his work rate it can be a bit annoying to play with him when his work rate is quite low and you really want him to make a run but he just doesn't seem to want to but another thing is his weak force it's not the biggest downfall but he is him he would probably be better with a better weak foot so yeah if you enjoy this video guys please leave a like if you've got a player you'd like me to review please leave them in the comment section below comment section comment comment section comment section below sorry about that that's a bit of a him i couldn't get my words out then but if you've played it with him as well please tell him what he feels like and until next time guys please subscribe for more videos and i'll see you later bye"
