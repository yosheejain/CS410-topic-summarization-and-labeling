        "transcript": "[Music] so when photos of a Porsche designed Blackberry started doing the rounds we were a little bit skeptical about ever seeing the real thing fast forward a few months later and look what we've got it's the Porsche Design P99 81 in all its boxy metallic Glory combining stylish looks and business for those with loaded wallets now this is without a doubt going to be one of those love it or hate it hand set it's a far cry from what we're used to when it comes to the king of querty so we can foresee a lot of blackbery loyalists hating its alternative angular design crafted from a single piece of brushed stainless steel it's futuristic looking querty keyboard real lever backside and Porsche brand logo all of which scream premium Goods now it probably hasn't gone unnoticed that it's taken a bit of a design cue from the Bold 9900 just with a huge dollop of extravagance and we have to admit we're a bit taken with its nonconformist nature it's not iPhone gorgeous but you can't help appreciating blackberry's retro and artsy efforts resulting in a handset that feels well constructed and solid in the hand and while it's pretty weighty compared to the majority of high-end smartphones it won't do your wrists any damage and you can't tell by just looking at it but the bottom edge of the phone is constructed from plastic to prevent antenna interference now despite opting for a drastically different metal quty keyboard that's flat and funky we're pleased to say that it doesn't let the side down and is as comfortable to type on as any phone from the Blackberry Bunch although saying that it's not as easy to type on as the 9900 as the keys are shorter and wider but adding a nice touch of the navigation buttons on top which are fashioned out of individual pieces of glass very very nice now on the inside we're looking at familiar os7 territory on its 2.8 in screen and as you can probably tell Porsche has given the icons and type face a once over that are exclusive to the phone to ensure they're very much in line with the premium nature of the design so while it may sport the same familiar draw likee layout we're used to seeing on blackberry's latest handsets it's different enough to stand out on its own it doesn't just share its good looks with the Bold 9900 either underneath they're essentially the same phone rocking a 1.2 GHz dual core processor 768 Meg of ram 8 gig of internal storage GPS NFC and a 5 megapixel camera round on the back with an LED flash and 720P HD video recording and you can expect the usual Trio of connectivity so 3G Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on top of all that you also get a dedicated charging dock in the Box to make your phone feel just that little bit extra special and to of course justify that price tag and that's the Blackberry Porsche Design p98 now whatever your thought it's still inherently Blackberry so a brilliant quy keyboard top-notch email and super superb battery life for those of you with deep enough Pockets so while you may like its stylish design at around ,300 it's safe to say you've got to really really like it in order to go out and make the purchase or maybe and this is just a suggestion you could go out buy yourself a Bold 9900 and give it a silver paint job again just a suggestion [Applause] [Music]"

        "transcript": "hello everyone today we'll be going over a protoss versus protoss fight in the top right uh is player glorfindle that's me uh and i'll be defending against uh the player not who is shown in red in the bottom left not is attempting to use the protoss proxy strategy where he sent out his first or one of his starting probes uh and he was going to actually create a pylon and create a forward base uh very close to my base the reason why the people might try this is that uh because you've built your gateway so close to the enemy base there's not a lot of running time for your actual units which gives you a bit of an advantage so but the point of this is is two things speed and not being uh detected um so so far he hasn't been detected by me i'm used i'm i got my first pylon out as you can see i'm up to 11 probes he only has eight probes so there's a big economy difference already uh he gets his first gateway out a little bit before mine i get my gateway out and then i send my probe down to scout the whole point of that at this point is that i have know i've always already have 13 probes so they're getting boosting my economy but i'm letting that one probe go down to scout and uh at this point i really should have recognized that uh he must be proxying me because any protoss at this point in the game will have at least a pylon in their base uh probably one to two gateways um you know much like how my base is set up so the fact that he doesn't have anything in there really should have told me that he's gonna proxy but i didn't the red flag didn't start waving till uh just a few more minutes but even as such it didn't really matter i had my first gateway out my first z-lot is being built uh using the chrono boost so it'll come out faster it's around this point in time where i actually realized that oh there's he must be proxying me because he has nothing in his base so i bring down two probes from my minerals to build a gateway and also to act as a little bit extra damage in case oh in case when he attacked for when he attacked so now i need i know i need to build z as furiously and fast as possible so he gets his second and third out and now it's time for him to charge i'm just gonna wait a little bit and then uh attack him because i know my second z-lot's coming out so we'll actually kill one of his but we know that we're probably no match at this point for him so we're just going to run away to try to save that z lot and hope that we can uh build enough i'm also going to take quite a few extra probes about five five to six typically and just use them to help with defense this is okay for me because as you remember i have a much better economy than this man so uh he's not gonna be able to out produce me just because i'm using probes even if he kills all those probes uh the damage is already done to his attacking force so at this point i mean like i'm already about the same level of producing sea loss as he is except my economy is a much better place so i've essentially already won so what i do it you know what you do at this point you just kind of give a little bit of time to make sure that you're pumping out units faster than he is so for instance i have four he has three uh pretty soon i'll have a six and he'll have maybe four or five there we go so now that i have an overpowering force i'm just going to go ahead and attack and not really even pay much attention to the attack because i know that i'll be able to beat them and with the end of that that's really the end of the game so uh the key to defending against the protoss proxy is one scout and then two obviously once you know that you're being proxied uh you need to make a change to your defense and feel free to use your probes or your drones etc because uh uh if you can block that initial push you really put yourself in a good position"

Make 1 or 2 scores on the mackerel skin's surface, for every slice about to be cut.\n(This fish-cutting technique is \"kirikake-zukuri\", often use \"sashimi\".) \"kirikake-zukuri\"\nMake 1 or 2 scores the skin, for every slice about to be cut. This technique makes both the skin and trunk easier to eat, and easier for the soy sauce to soak into the fish. Arrange the ingredients on a large plate. For garnish, with shiso leaves (green perilla).\nArrange on the plate in a well-balanced.\nWhen beautifully arranged, your dishes look even more delicious. Arrange the 1 pack salmon roe in a small bowl. Arrange the marinated mackerel on another plate with shiso leaves. Put the 6 tbsp sugar (90ml), 2 tsp salt (10ml), and 7 tbsp vinegar (105ml) into a small pot.\nAnd stir well until dissolve. If it is difficult to dissolve, heat the pot slightly.\nThis liquid is a \"sushi vinegar\". Put the 5 cups cooked rice (as hot as possible) in the \"Handai\" (or a large bowl),\nand pour the \"sushi vinegar\" over the rice evenly. Then mix with cutting motion.\n(\"Handai\" is a rice tub, used to make sushi rice.) When mixing is completed, cool the rice with a hand-fan.\nAllow it to cool at body temperature. Cut the toasted \"nori\" seaweed into easy-to-roll sheets, and serve. It's done."

        "transcript": "hi guys and welcome to today's anime review number 21 me myself and I will be bringing you this review what can I say my other selves are getting restless you would be too if you were locked up inside yourself all the time she should just have a point it can get a little boring being sealed away a lot uh guys you're kind of making me sound like I have you enslaved and make you do my bidding or something look at actual is new you I'm sorry I didn't mean any disrespect as I'm sure you figured out my mean side and my shy side is going to be joining me in making today's video so let's get out with the review this review is dedicated to [\u00a0__\u00a0] Sookie 18 and shadow God for you really those are their names well it's it's just their usernames i'm sure the real names are different i like them i I think they're creative shut up nobody cares what you think I care what she thinks too bad nobody cares what you think either what oh you just hold it right there excuse me guys I have to go teach myself some respect oh um today's anime is yuyu hakusho you realize how old this anime is right yes I'm aware but it doesn't necessarily determine whether an anime is good or bad yuyu hakusho first started airing on October tenth of 1992 and finished on January seventh 1995 running for 112 episodes oh there they were also 20 va's that's right they aired on September 21st 1994 and October fifth 1994 idiot there was a second set of ova he's running for four episodes as well that is also write those ran from december 16th 1995 till februari 7th of 1996 there were also two movies this series follows the story of yusuke urameshi who in an uncharacteristic act of heroism is hit by a car and killed an attempt to save a small boy his spirit is fed by boat on a spirit guide boat on informs yusuke that his act of heroism had caught even the underworld off guard and there was not yet a place for arming either heaven or hell Vasco Enma son of the underworld King Emma offers uski a chance to return to his body through a series of tests yusuke succeeds in his return to his body for a second chance at life oh good lord she just keeps going and going after returning to life kawin my grants yusuke the title of underworld detective charging him with investigating supernatural activity in the human world and thus the base of the anime some other important characters would be cool bara a fellow delinquent who sees yusuke as his rival and through his detective work you scheme meets two demons who are also recurring characters heee and kurama personally I like uski best you're crazy he is far better than yusuke I I like drama now this like I have mentioned in other reviews is a cookie cutter anime granted with it being so old it may be more like the mold and really for good reason the only other anime that I would place in a cookie cutter category back in the 1990s would be dragon ball which actually started airing back in 1986 now this is with first originally aired in japan and then it was quickly followed by dragon ball z does anyone else think this is pointless information no just me great the twists and turns that this anime takes keeps you interested in what's going to happen next in the story but like I always say about cookie cutter animes they're predictable to a degree but there are so many cookie cutter animes for a reason they're good I've yet to see an anime that I've put into the cookie cutter category that I haven't enjoyed wait for it there's going to be a button but ha told you you can only watch so much before you're ready to move on to something new too many cookies will give you a tummy ache exactly also the age of this series really shows it really doesn't stand up to today's standards of animation and for that reason alone it's going to lose points so basing it off of being an anime watched for the first time now I'm going to give it a rating of a big fat zero what no not zero a five no not five either I'm going to give it a 3.5 it's worth watching even today age isn't always a bad thing if you like this enemy you'll like other enemies such as cookie cutter anime well yes but this is where we list a few titles for them oh I know one all right good Naruto that's a good one good one how r comment victa ball can you get all right what would you suggest hmm something less common how about flame of recca yes that's also a good one you might also like bleach as well thanks for watching guys thank you very much I hope you enjoyed Oh buzz off i'm not gonna thank you it's um it's it's time for the random stuff whoo random stuff I'm so excited up first is some cosplayers doing the thriller dance it'll pop up somewhere I thought they did a good job of the dance and it was really entertaining to watch i'd like i'd like to share a caramel dance and 122 this anime I think I hope you think it's cute too fine you want me to share something since is an old school anime how about an old school AMV ghostbusters is a classic hope you enjoyed guys by my extra was the best wasn't it"

        "transcript": "everyone welcome to another episode of Raw radiant health.com and I'm Natasha St Michael and thank you so much for joining me so today I'm wanted to address a very common question I get I get this question all the time it's how do you get started how how do where to start when you want to start eating healthy this is like the number one question that most people have you know is like they they think about what they're eating and what they should take out and then then suddenly they're just so overwhelmed they don't even know where to start so today I want to just give you guys one simple tip and that is to start somewhere it's not about cutting things out overnight and cutting everything out overnight because that only makes people like crazy and it only a lot of times will be too extreme that next thing you know it it could set themselves up for binging and overeating you know a lot of times when you cut out everything suddenly you want everything so my advice is always to start simple start with one thing start with one step and Implement that in your life get used to it do for a long period of time at least a month or two and then go on to the next thing so you might want to choose one type of food it might be like you know you notice you eat too much sugar so you might want to just do an experiment of cutting out soda from your your diet and doing that for one or two months and then later on it might be want to cut out the candy bars you know but I find a lot of times when people cut all sugar all at once it it's it could be too much much and it could only set the themselves up for disaster and feel guilty afterwards so I always say do things one step at a time and that way you look at it more on the long term you see it as something that these are lifetimes lifelong changes things that you're going to maintain and do forever and that at some point and in in the near future you're not even going to be faced by it you're not even going to be tempted by these foods and I find if you do it slowly and gently way easier so sit down and think about you know what is one of those foods that you you know you're addicted to that you're like compulsively need every single day and choose just one of those foods and tell yourself you're doing an experiment to see what it's going to be like without it and what you can creatively come up with that might be either a healthier version or something else to eat instead something else that makes you feel good but it's healthy you know the main thing is is that if someone's used to having that candy bar at 4:00 every day because they have an energy slump they have an energy slump at that time of day so if they cut out the candy bar and they don't have anything else it might just make them feel groggy and bad and hungry so a lot of times you have to figure out well what else can I have instead you know it's not only cutting the things out but it's what you're going to add in so and think about healthy healthier foods to eat you know perhaps it's going to be some fruit or perhaps it's going to be a nice salad or you know having more vegetables at lunchtime so that you're full throughout the day and don't need to snack that kind of stuff so taking things one step at a time and listening and feeling your body and seeing what it needs and what it doesn't and just remember one thing is that usually it takes about 3 Days To week to feel better after letting go of some of these junk fuits so a lot of times the first day it can be quite difficult and people think oh I can't do this it's just too difficult I'm too addicted but if you give it you know the first day is always the worst but after 3 days it's smooth sailing from there so I'm wishing you guys a fabulous day and I just want to show you a little bit of the beach here on colanta this is just a little Bay that I I stopped at to do a little video so and just for you guys to enjoy I'm just I love this island"

        "transcript": "okay this is what I'm working on today 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee and I'm going to be changing the seal on the gear steering gear box to get the nut off the pitman arm you're going to need a 33 mm socket on up 33m socket on a uh breaker bar and on my breaker bar I put it inside another pipe because it's so hard to get off you got to use a huge arm at least for mine it's from Michigan then after that it's going to make a huge pop here you are this is the pitman arm puller I'm going to use I've already sprayed it with a lot of PB Blaster and it's been soaking in power steering fluid for forever so this is the pitman arm that's the nut right there put pitman arm puller on it you just go over the pitman arm line it up and tighten it down on the nut you can want to make sure that of course it's sounded very straight you don't want to pull the pitman arm at an angle I already know this is going to be terribly difficult to pull just because the amount of rust and time on this thing and that steering stuff are always on there tight but make sure to pull it straight and line it up so you have less angle on it my next step that I'm not going to be able to show you cuz I'm going to be using both hands is I'm going to tighten tight this up real tight then I'm going to knock the pitman arm with a hammer then tighten it up knock the pitman arm with hammer hopefully help Shake It Loose as we tighten it up okay so I've gotten the thing to pop by using the pit arm remover it was of course on there tremendously hard lots of PB Blaster and I used not only the breaker bar but then my extension bar and even then you know don't keep your head beneath that thing because it when it comes off it's going to explode the other thing is one thing that is wisdom is to leave the nut still on which I did I just took it off here with my hands but leave the nut on while you still have the pitman arm just loosen it up but keep it just just on the end you know little something like just just barely on there maybe a thread or two or three something because when that Pitman arm comes out you don't want it to shoot out and you know if you're underneath it you know crack you in the head or something so keep the nut on until you pop it Loose after you pop it Loose then you can remove the nut entirely and I'm going to put the Putman armor remover on there to get the whole way now before I remove it the the rest of the way I've also taken a chance to scribe two marks for me just line them back up on the shaft just so I have a better likelihood of getting it back on the in the angle that I've taken it off I hear that they're Cur keyed specially so it'd be sort of hard for me to actually screw this up but just in case I scri I de scribed some marks on there okay now I'm going to put on the pitman arm puller again just pull it off the rest of the way hopefully the rest of the pulling part should go pretty easy okay so this is what it looks like with the nut and the pitman arm off I took some paper towels on a screwdriver and I cleaned out the inside so you can see what the inside looks like and I have to say with all honesty I was expecting to see a snap ring in there but I just don't yet I know that's what's inside there and it's still even leaking even now it's really slow okay these are the pieces you have one seal here metal washer I'm going to put those on the bottom and you have this one and the plastic washer I'm going to put that one on top and this is the snap ring that goes all the way in the bottom so it's going to be stacked like this in my opinion I don't know if that's absolutely correct though because I've been unable to get the seal out I don't see a snap ring whatsoever under this thing which leads makes me wonder about the whole scenario like if it ever had one in it does seem to have a metal washer there's tons of space up in there so I'm not going to really recommend this to anybody else but I just plan to cram all those seals in there and then bow it down and see what happens okay this is what it looks like with the first seal crammed in that was the one with the plastic backing I'm going to go for the Rubber seal with the metal washer behind it okay this is what it looks like with the second seal on it in retrospect I probably should have used the Rubber seal plus the metal seal first and use that plastic seal on the bottom because right now the metal one just wants to fall out so and then I've got the snap ring so I'm going to see if I have enough room to where did I put that metal washer yeah that's the one yeah so this one over top of this and if there was just enough room which it doesn't appear there will be it's close then I was going to use the snap ring to hold that one on right now I'm leaning towards the snap ring just by itself but we'll see okay here's what I end up doing put in that seal the top seal and on the bottom put in the snap ring give you an idea of how much clearance there is left there's not a whole lot I don't think I would have been able to fit the metal washer and the snap ring so I'm just using that snpp ring as the washer I got both seals in there though right now no leaks still wet in there for all the PB Blaster I was throwing on everything but even just sitting still without any pressure or even a drive used to see it drip drip drip okay but that's what it looks like there's Pitman back arm the pitman arm is pretty straightforward to put on it's actually keyed so you can't be off by too many you know more than maybe like 25 degrees so if you're relatively close to where you were you should be able to line it up okay I still did marks on mine but even without that you shouldn't be too far off and then just slide it up there and bolt it on as tight as you can go there you can see this new seal hiding up there behind the shaft it's got the snap ring on it okay"

        "transcript": "yo guys what is up it's D here and I'm here with a new video about the new crossbows that recently just got released all right so these are called the assession crossbow and you have a main hand and off hand obviously since they're are crossbows unless it's a two-handed crossbow and these are the equivalent of the level 90 drag war weapons so basically that means they have the same damage as you can see here the dragon maze has 864 and the assession balls have 864 as well then accuracy wise obviously also the same so 2,458 and here they are the same all right so basically that means they are like the same and they should do the same DPS now that's also the case but the bad thing about range is that the range abilities are really like they are underpowered compared to the melee one because Mee has so many and like Mee has the berserk one which the range doesn't have and then again magic has with the exate so range really needs a berserk one and then like it could keep up with the Le abilities but still I think we also need a few more good thresholds but anyways so the new crossbow is pretty good actually since it has really high curency and it can be really useful to use them at bosses such as D NEX and Kat King and hopefully for future strong bosses as well so they can actually do like hit more often instead of the level 80 weapons which have like 600 less or 500 less accuracy so that's quite useful I'm going to be comparing ing them now with the automate called Deadshot which always does the same bleed effect so that's a good comparison now in this clip I'm going to use it with the assession crossbows and you'll be see me hitting me 815 now in this clip I'm going to be using the card crossbows and as you can see those are hitting 739 so that means that the session crossbows do like around 10% more damage which is quite nice that's because it's level 10 levels higher than the G one so that means they have 10% more damage this also goes for the drag mes compared to the K maze or like K Rapier there's a weir glitch currently which I found out on Smoke's video where the off hand doesn't take account the weapon type or the weapon damage when using abilities so in this example I'm using the main hand assession crossbow and the off hand bronze crossbow and it's doing exactly the same damage with the bleed on that shot as I did with the Dual crossbows sessions and yeah so that's pretty weird uh they have to f that ASAP so basically it means at the moment we can use a main hand assession crossbow and a off and bronze or it doesn't even matter what it is and still do the same damage with abilities so yeah that's kind of weird and hopefully it should get fixed soon so you cannot use that though with momentum like doing uh Auto attacks because if you're trying to use a level one bow with level 90 bolts it won't work but it does work with abilities uh really enough so yeah anyway guys that's basically it um here's a few close-ups from thebo and how it looks like on your back it looks pretty cool but I do think they look kind of small like I was hoping for something like really big sadly these cool Fortune items look way cooler than the in-game items but yeah um there's not all too much to talk about these weapons I really like though how they introdu them by getting six different pieces of each mini boss and then assembling it to one bow with the help of a bow as well with the dragon crossbow so I kind of like this concept I hope they do this for Future Weapons as well they should have done this with drags as well but yeah that's kind of too late now anyway guys here's also another clip of me using it at next solo and at armadil anyways guys I'm off and enjoy the video and I'll see you tomorrow for a video about the six bosses see you guys [Music] [Music] n [Music] n [Music]"

months of course November's the d-day and right now it's May yeah totally have way too many months in between now and the game releases and of course right now III is going on and I don't know if you guys watched a live stream but they did have a black ops meeting of course yesterday which was Monday the fourth so basically what you seen was a little bit of gameplay from it you seen some guns that's going to be more or less in it they did show more campaign obviously because they didn't show any multiplayer kills that's usually now released until about august-september more likely that's whenever we'll see it I'm guessing but it just do no matter that's where ever they had the betas whether it's open or closed which more likely it's gonna make closed beta like all the other betas but I've remembered back in mw2 when that released you had a little riot show gameplay and capture the flag that was like the main concept of I guess they're multiplayer coming into mw2 so with black ops 2 coming out I'm so excited and there is a few I guess argument of things with it I kind of wanted to talk a little bit about the sniping end of it just because that's the main I guess aspect a lot of people really took from the little preview so if you didn't catch it there's actually a sniper rifle that you can pretty much see through freaking walls now whether it's an x-ray scope or it's a thermal infrared something that you can see through walls that picks up heat through walls I don't know exactly one hundred percent what kind of scope it is um i just kind of picked up a little bit on it while is watching a few other live streams at the same time but it looks pretty nifty not gonna lie it looks pretty sweet now is it gonna be in the pool I guess multiplayer I don't know um sometimes you will see guns that pop up in campaign that's not necessarily in multiplayer is just like I guess in zombies you see the Raygun pop up or the wonder waffle which is by the way the wonder waffle is the coolest name for a gun ever but now those guns are not a multiplayer obviously now if they were that'd be pretty sick you have five gas coming at you pretty much you wonder waffle once and they pretty much all have a electrocution pretty much just like they hit the lecture chair yes zap [\u00a0__\u00a0] so um I guess they'd be kind of a covel I guess emblem to double get for your online experiences basically having a electric chair saying zap [\u00a0__\u00a0] I don't know that's the new word of the day is zap [\u00a0__\u00a0] yes as you know Moab [\u00a0__\u00a0] is one of them that [\u00a0__\u00a0] just became one of them just cause it came up with it pretty much any word you throw a [\u00a0__\u00a0] at the end of it that's pretty much what you have and that's the way we would go with it of course I have t-shirts on my side if you really want a t-shirt yeah I made some of those the other day anyways enough about that [\u00a0__\u00a0] um so I guess the more the aspect of what is sniping really gonna be like you know going into black ops you had no quick scoping at all and i'm sure they finally learned the lesson just kind of deal with it quick scoping is around as part of the community it's not one hundred percent a realistic game so you know i mean whenever you have a gala laying around crawling with dead man's hand you know it's not realistic so i guess in more of the sense that you know they're going to have siping probably quickscoping i wouldn't see why not just calls i mean whatever black ops came out they finally went to quickscope now the mechanics of the sniping is more or less what I like to look at okay so if you look at black ops sniping versus any other ecology doesn't matter if it's World War anything if you look at I guess how infinity ward with the modern warfare series if you look at how the sniper can swing around I don't know if you have actually realized that between Black House a lot of people did and they didn't but if you look at the whole swinging around the sniper rifle it just seems to react so much better to spinning and yes I mean sometimes it's better for I guess 360s but I feel like it's easier to drag scope I'm more of a drag scope for myself and some of you might be as well and mw3 has a little bit more I guess I'm not so much [\u00a0__\u00a0] I guess bullet lag so you know bullets actually do go straight so if you can't drag I guess across the body and completely be on the other side and hit open the right arm like you used to kind of like the curve the bullet like the wanted little movie so not necessarily the exact same way as that however you still can drag subtool point but in black ops you could not have the scope at all the gun at all sway around it pretty much well as a fix a two point and the gun was always in the exact same alignment and I don't really like that because what you get is the gun of the sniper it's better if you swipe it because if you swing around one way the gun kind of disappears gives you a little bit more of a vision a field of vision so I mean it's all about sniping with a big-ass gun so of course snipers with the big scopes that takes up more screen than any other gun on the game which I mean it's more or less saying hey you need to use a sniper scope then just kind of walk around with it and you know you can't you basically lose a little bit more of your field of vision however I really hope that they change that and the same thing with a Wawa I know a lot of people use the wild wild more or less for I guess trick shine the wawa claim or plant 360 ladder stall on another 360 yeah I don't use the wawa for that why why actually and if you don't know I'm talking about basically you tap while I really fasten the gun you know fluctuates and it's like you're switching guns what you really don't basically you switch guns but you can slip and you have the same gun so with that if u YY then basically you know it drops your gun down you can see your whole screen and actually worked a lot better for competitive gaming so whenever back in college before I know why people use the m16 they used to wawa shot and it actually made their shots a little bit more accurate I know one guy he freaking could go on point with that and it has a lot to do with how the aim assist is and things like that so yes why lying actually can help your aim assist just because whenever your gun does come back up it seems like it tracks to the nearest dude and I don't know if you remember the training session before like the whole campaign basically like yeah tap in with the left stick and then just shoot basically it auto assist you to that point that's closest to it yes you do have to aim a little bit too more or less online than you do in campaign however I guess it's more or less that the wawa kind of took place of that and they felt the need to take it out of mw3 basically where uyy then you still have to swim in you can't just hold the zoom trigger I really prefer just having built a hold of zoom trigger I guess you know multitasking some days is not very good for me and maybe it's not good for you but it's just kind of annoying gonna have to kiss something taken away that completely you know you use every day it's just a little bit better if you don't have to worry about that [\u00a0__\u00a0] and you know I guess it just depends on how you look at it but anyways back to the infrared scope I guess if you haven't seen it go check it out i'm sure there's videos actually on youtube about it and you know it's really sweet not gonna lie i mean Belva shoot through walls is pretty cool now of course we're looking at a more futuristic game i think they says can be 2020 maybe and in the timeline of a year so that's um you know kind of cool it's gonna be a little futuristic now whatever else they bring I've seen some things like with these arm patches and everything and you know more or less i'll just say check it out if you haven't seen it but anyways viewers let me know what your opinions are of course on sniping or anything black ops because i'm gonna try to bring you a decent amount of stuff as the week's progress and you know until next time I'm liquid and I'm out"

being bitten by a snake being punched several times by monkeys and just a few days ago was attacked by a shark Eric is now recovering at Mata General Hospital and joins me exclusively along with his wife spring Eric well good to see you alive first of all how are you I'm doing great I'm feeling a lot better than I was a few days ago I'll tell you that well I bet you you were spear fishing in the Bahamas with your wife uh your four daughters and your father-in-law when you felt the shark bite your leg tell me what happened well just like you said I was spear fishing and I felt this uh tremendous powerful crunch on my uh calf and when I looked back I saw him ripping a piece away and swimming away with a piece in his mouth and did you think that you you you'd had it it was going to kill you or how are you feeling in that moment you know I I'll I'll tell you to be honest with you I believe with all my heart that God sustained me in that moment of time to give me no fear and no worry no anxiety and I flipped up to Shore and I and I uh I tied a tourniquet around my knee uh to stop the bleeding and started calling for help and uh my daughter got on the um radio and radio for help and and thank God there was a a man close by by the name of Mike mdo that came and was able to get me to uh a clinic pretty quick now the bizarre thing about you is that this is not the first uh brush with death you've been struck by lightning in a storm in Florida when you were 10 bitten by a rattlesnake we nearly lost a leg then and spent two weeks in intensive care and punched by monkeys on more than one occasion what is it with you and monkeys I don't know I just maybe I monkey around too much I don't know they they like me I know you're a religious man but do you think that God is acting on your side saving you from death in these incidents or is he picking you out the special attention I think that he's he's continually challenging me to trust him which is what I believe that we all need to do through through hard times through good times through bad times uh it's important to always trust God now let me let me turn to Spring your wife spring I mean this must be a pretty longsuffering marriage you're going through about every 3 minutes he's being attacked by either bolt of lightning or monkeys or sharks or snakes there's no no rest f for you well it's an adventuresome marriage a lot of those things happened when he was younger the monkeys um are since I've been around but um the shark bite was quite a scare that's for sure why do you think monkeys dislike him so much well one time was kind of my fault actually I I sort of teased him into it she locked me in a cage with a violent monkey and watched it attack me and took pictures matter of fact we we put the we put the pictures on our on our website on my businesses website so people can see the so let me get this absolutely straight let me get this straight spring you locked your husband in a cage with an angry monkey and when it punched him you then put the picture straight on Facebook is that is that what I'm hearing more or less but a serious point it must have been pretty scary for you spring and and your daughters when this this shark made this attack on your husband how are you feeling about it all um it's still a lot to take in um when I still really think about the actual day it's pretty overwhelming to think about um it was very scary and as the water turned to blood and Eric crawling out of rocks it was like a Discovery Channel show before my eyes almost like it's hard to believe it's reality what is the prognosis for you with that leg is it all going to be okay you going to be back to normal I think so I had a couple of skin graphs uh I had one of the best doctors here at Tampa General Dr David chesla that worked on it and uh I think I'm going to be uh there's a verse that says uh I will walk and not grow weary and I will run and not grow faint Mount up with wings like eagles and I think that that's just what I'm going to do Isaiah chter 40 and you are actually you're a thoroughly good chap you do missionary work in Australia and you're starting a shelter for the homeless I mean if the good Lord is watching tonight and I'm sure he is would you like him just to lay off you a bit for a while absolutely not I want to keep going forward I want to do what he wants me to do and uh you know we're doing some work in uh the Dominican Republic uh we're doing some work here in in pelis County with the Dream Center working with with uh we're trying to put together a drug rehabilitation center and uh we've got a lot of friends around the world in Papa New Guinea with Samaritan Aviation that are doing great things and my buddy Thomas Dickerson that that uh was with

        "transcript": "as soon as we learned that we were going to be working on the game I asked myself uh what is what is it that we haven't seen yet in the Video Game World uh you know in the Spider-Man universe at first we just we were just looking at it as possibilities for you know like an exclusive game in the future an exclusive game in the Noir genre but then as we brainstorm uh the idea sort of came together to actually be able to play them all and so you know that proved to be quite a challenge at first because people are like you know what four games in one are you guys crazy and we're like no you know then we started looking at it and it made a lot of sense so we were able uh to establish that we could have four worlds four different Spider-Man in one game with each uh their unique art Direction once we had established that we wanted to to to have a concept with four worlds we brought a Dan slot into the mix Dan slot is the actual writer of the amazing comic book series so he came up with the uh the uh the mystical artifact known as the tablet of Order and Chaos and so when that tablet gets shattered in the beginning of the game uh the the fragments are sent through multiple dimensions and it's up to each Spider-Man to retrieve them now uh unfortunately for Spider-Man and ends up in the wrong hands uh each villain actually gets a piece of the tablet and gains uh additional superpowers that no one has seen before uh and basically it's up to them to retrieve uh all all fragments of the tablet so the brand new universe that we revealed is 2099 uh and I was really excited to be revealing that Universe what's great about 2099 is is the city itself and the city has its personality I mean we're talking about high verticality uh we're talking about a city bustling with life you know it's it's sensory overload basically it's cars driving all over the place you know like giant animated Billboards uh you know commercials playing all over the place uh the influence really was sort of a bland up Blade Runner the fifth element and a little bit of our own design uh and so um the other thing that's unique to 2099 is the fact that Spider-Man has web foils that allows him to actually um you know dive at high speed uh base jump basically in some of the in some of the areas of the level uh which provides great you know action uh moments uh that are totally exclusive to 2099 also this character has uh talents and so we um you know his fighting style is more towards like you know fighting up close and personal uh you know you know basically leaping on your enemies you know with claws and uh but also he's got something unique that none of the other Spider-Mans have it's what we call the accelerated Vision that's a big term for uh all allowing the character to slow down things around him while keeping your uh your speed uh you gain advantage over the battle uh when you fight enemies that move at high speed or you know if a missile sent at you then you know can slow down time and then move around and uh and get uh an an advantage over the combat we all face our fair share of evil so basically uh the story is divided in three acts so we have act one act two act three and in each one you have to go through one level of each dimension so and it's up to the player basically the player decides which one he wants to pick so you can you can go in 2099 can go Noir amazing unknown Universe not revealed yet uh and once all of them are completed uh then we move on with the story with act two and so and the player has a liberty there and can just pick up the levels uh he feels he wants to complete the levels have been designed so you have enough Freedom enough freedom of movement within the levels to to feel like you're Spider-Man so you can web swing anywhere you want you can crawl on any surface you want um that we've maintained so in this case for 2099 you can still web swing in the city uh you know the city will have its limits uh but I not to the point where you would feel cheated or frustrated when you're playing the game after all you're after the villain so uh you know the idea is you have to catch up to him uh and the level design is designed in such way that you know you wouldn't start you know web swinging you know in the wrong direction uh so we we still have that all intact in our game Spider-Man chatter Dimensions coming in September on PS3 Xbox 360 Nintendo Wii and DS"

        "transcript": "hey YouTubers it's Y2K again and um today I want to talk about characters with Polaris and how I have found my um treatment and creams that have helped me recover really fast I had KP after my upper arms and as well as my thighs basically these are the tips and creams I used during the last two to three weeks and I don't like KP all cleared and my Skin's um healthy again I can sleep peacefully so what I did was during my shower periods I would use a normal cloth like that about that size and use Olay Quench and I put it on a cloth and just gently scrub it off but if you're a kp's really inflamed try not to use any kind of exploiting exfoliating um items like a glove or a cloth just use your hands and just layer it one time and wash it off with lukewarm water and not hot water because hot water seems to make the KP a lot more itchier and when you finish your shower use cold water to cool off your skin so that you become the inflammation down and these are the this is the cream that mainly helped me a lot it's called euromole 20. it's your normal 10 and 20 you can buy them at your local Walmart or drugstore um you shouldn't need a prescription for this because you can just pick it off the shelf for the counter and it's very good actually if you answer there's any side effects or not I haven't really felt any side effects but it's been useful and it's not very big it's not too expensive I got to Walmart about 9.74 and it's about this much so when you apply it just put about this much onto your finger so mess around like that much on the factory area go one layer when you finish doing a layer and the best you put it when you wake up in the morning and you have your shower in the morning after the shower and before you go to bed and that would be the best time for your skin to recover fast so remember you're all 10 or 20. 20 is more severe cases 10 is more mild or moderate cases you can also use Aveeno cream which is the fragrance fee for those of you who don't mind using something without fragrance but that's open it so people who might go for gluten-free diet might not really approve of using oh no but you can also use cetaphil's moisturizing cream it's not uh commodogenic and that's fragrance free in it that'll fill so take a look and so basically these few items helped me out in recovering my KP um get better this is for you to wash and this is for normal moisturizing um you can get this for like 10 bucks maybe 12. yeah and or you can use a vino fragrance free as well and most importantly your Mall training which helped my severe case of course some doctors recommend using aha like hydrogen but aha is very very strong and it's basically like going after the fly of a bazooka so if you use Aha and your skin is inflamed and the Skin's braided or broken be advised that it will sting it's like pouring hot water well not hot water but like quite hot watering is it's gonna be like a bit of a sting on the affected areas so I would advise not to use aha unless you really have to and your skin is not broken you can use this but until then I would recommend stuff that's not too strong but your mom's your best bet to go for so hit me back because um comments feedbacks questions and below and I'll try to answer them and I hope your KP recovers better for you ladies and gentlemen out there and I'm with you in all this situation and I I'm been trying to get this message through but YouTube had to uh tell me to cut down times limit of this video so it's a bit quick all right so if any questions just um ask away take care guys"

        "transcript": "hey guys just want to do a critical video to show you how to put a permanent line on your layout boat this boat doesn't really have any tie offs to be able to tie brush on to it so what you got to do is do some holes right there and then you come over here and you've got these little pop rivets just like this these are 3/8 take one of those after you've drilled your holes after you've measured and drilled your holes go ahead and take your silicone here make sure it's waterproof silicone cover cover the underside of this and cover each one of the the ends of your pop rivets slide your both your pop rivets down in there use your a little twelve dollar pop rivet gun real cheap from Lowe's take that and I don't know if you can see it on the camera but you can see where I just basically cuts that off once it mushrooms out underneath here it'll go ahead and cut the stem off and and you're good to go I didn't put I don't put any of these pop rivets on the top on the ends because if you want to put another seat here but I do have a popper or have your pad eyes right here and here and the seat will just go right in between them it can slide back and forth a little bit but this is kind of a good range where I have those pad eyes so and then we'll also have a line running around the bottom lip of the boat now again all this is above water but you see on one like this you want to make sure you get good silicone all the way around each one of those as you can see these are some of that prep right here so that's what the rivets look like before they're before they're done you just go to work on it okay as you can see we've got all of our pad eyes set like we want them they are good to go so now what we're gonna do is take this seven strand 550 paracord and this is actually a bungee cord so it's only 1/8 inch thick I wish it were 1/4 inch but we're probably a double wrap the whole area so basically what we're going to do is take this cord tie it to probably to this corner right here and then run it all the way around and that's what that's what what is going to allow us to strap our or zip tie our mesh fencing to so we're at the end of day one I have the bungee cable on the boat you see I've ran it through every one of the pad eyes on here and all the way around the lip of that then I came back around and ran it all the way across the top here on both sides and now I've just got it tied off here on the end until I decide exactly what length since that's only 8 inch I may go back around with it one more time as you can see I still got quite a bit of rope left so alright as you can see we've got our knitting on and you can see we've attached it to the top and we've attached it to the bottom once I had it fully attached I went ahead and trimmed it right here at the waterline and so that's just kind of the sides so essentially we have both sides completely netted so our brush is actually ready to go on there and now it's time to figure out the netting on the front and then on the back back there so as you can see we've got our netting completely on front back I didn't zip tie it down to here because I won't have access to that little apartment right there so as you can see this thing came originally with nice bungee strap so what I did was I just ran my smaller bungee just rectly there so I was able to attach to it so if I ever need to get in here I can just unhook that one and the other one and it won't affect how this is on here so now what I'm gonna do is attach brush to this netting so the brush that I'll be using is a Spanish moss here in Southeast Texas there's plenty of that to go around so you just if you know somebody that's got some property or you can just get something off the side of the road and basically it works the same as raffia grass or any kind of store-bought grass but what's nice is when you put your zip ties in there you won't have to worry about your zip ties being exposed it'll kind of disappear down into there so now I didn't mention this earlier but to attach all your netting and everything I only use these four inch little zip ties just these four inch short you can get these from Walmart for a lot cheaper even than Lowe's so and now to attach the brush I'll be using these eight inch cable ties so here we go as you can see we're about halfway through we've got a brush all on this side so making good progress as you can see this is the final product we were able to cut the netting at the water line and then whenever you put your brush on there it'll actually drip down below the waterline to make it look as natural as possible so I've also got some layout doors that are just that same mesh material that has a PVC pipe on the base end of it right here and then I've attached my netting all to it and then I have a zip tied that to the side of it so as you can see you can hop down in there and have you a good cover wherever you want to go I'm still debating on if I want to keep those doors or not I may end up just cutting natural brush and I can still slide natural rush in to cover the opening of the hole in there so there it is for pretty inexpensive probably under $100 you can make your own blind if you can find anywhere to get free free brush especially like this Spanish moss it's a really good deals so I want to give you guys a recap on the items that we used and where I got the items and basically the best prices that you're going to be able to get on on most of your items so to start off I went to Walmart and was able to get the silicone you seen in the video just got that from Walmart I also got the four inch cable ties zip ties as well as the eight inch that's Walmart's gonna be your best price on those then I went to Lowe's and was able to get your green fencing that's about three quarter inch of green fencing you can find it in the gardening section also got these pop rivets they are 3/16 in diameters and they are 1/2 inch length to give you plenty of room for whatever material you're going through just got those at Lowe's as well as well as the Stanley pop rivet gun it's about twelve or fourteen bucks at Lowe's the other thing I ended up getting I didn't go to Bass Pro for this where these pad eyes so everywhere I've got these put these on the boat got these from Bass Pro you can find them in the kayak section they're just a few bucks at four for a pack of about ten or twelve of them and lastly my bungee cable that I use I actually ordered this off of paracord planet comm but you can actually you might go find it at Walmart like I said I would prefer one one quarter inch over one eighth inch so like I said I got plenty of this leftover to use for anything else other boats I'm in the future thanks guys"

Show we have got top Fel rocking the house in this vital I guess seriously opening round of the championship and as I said Steve re joining us today back in the game after an incredible crash in Sydney pal what's the story this is a remarkable should I say to see you guys back racing this weekend how did it come about um well we run an interstate Transport company and after the accident I had to get back in one of our drivers on holiday we were doing a trip down to Sydney on last Friday night and uh a phone call comes out as we're coming down the F3 and it was Santo oh Steve he says you want to go racing next weekend and I said oh you know I always want to go racing he said hey would you like to borrow my uh the red car and this is a car I drove for 5 years when I was driving for him so the boys have worked really really hard um led by car crew chief here they got the car last Sunday and they just worked for midnight every single night putting it together so we can come this weekend I guess the obvious question we have to ask Steve what actually happened that caused the incid of down in C can you talk us through it well when I left the line I'm I realized the car was probably on the pass of its life I mean it it really motored to half track and then the it got real skatey towards the top end and then it was oh bleep um the throttle stuck again and then that's that point I realized I was in deep trouble CU I knew it was on the path of his life I'm here under the very impressive jimm Reed racing Banner here to catch up with a man who has yet to lose a race in his last nine starts mon to marus can you keep that unbeaten streak going well we certainly hope so but we haven't got any really high expectations about about that we just intend to go rounds every

the magic here we go 10.8 points per game 5.3 rebounds 4.2 assists and my guys changed a little bit but it's for the better promise so we're driving up the court here we go Tim Duncan wants the easy points and I'm going to give it to him teoc Howard thinks he's good or something and they keep giving me the ball and I'm going to keep putting points up on the board yeah look at that look how bad chob is he better not pull that crap again this game watch if he makes this shot then I'll I'll be happy but if he misses it he's going to be missing all game yeah he's going to be missing all game Jefferson make it no one wants to make it so I'm going to take the ball and can I get the AL ah that was a bad pass this is very embarrassing don't give it to job I'm surprised he didn't take that oh yeah but he'll take this one and he'll miss it as always I'm taking this yeah jobi don't take it don't take it job I'm begging you don't take the shot takes it up oh I got injured what happened no this is terrible what happened I need to know what happened will I get subed back in at least I got subbed in what's wrong here is Parker ah the pimp walk dun here's the I'm going to check to see what happened in about a second after jobi takes a shot right I'll take it and I'll make it leing and no get the basket next time he gets a look that he's got to make it count here's Nelson I'm wide open take it the all right let's see what happened to me game stats injuries twisted ankle day to day so that's not so bad I'll just have to sit in another game take away I'm going to get blocked that was a bad shot but I got the rebound I'm not going to put it back up I'm smarter than that of theame LP should back back back back look at that jam ah why do I have to play the entire game like this I can't even walk down the court this is ridiculous arus I'm going to shoot this right over your face get ready from 14 and the best ever but Manu is definitely in the I mean he's on the list that's how we do it I love the fact that when I have the ball I don't pimp walk you it comin as soon as I give it up let's make this three little make aoin okay who we giving it to Tim Duncan dun Nails as always I'm not going to follow the plays just give to Tim Duncan for the points look at that slam dunk all right let's keep not listening to the play calling here we go Jefferson this is too easy going up the court who's going to go to the basket whoever's going to the basket I'm going to reward you come on Tim dun ah he's going to give it back to me I almost got swatted all right subed back in we're down by 10 38 seconds left in this first half Tim Duncan's going to give me the ball I think here's the machine and I'm going to reward Tim Duncan or I'll just take it myself look at that hammer out rebounding him and we're driving down the court come on Thiago yes look at that I pushed him out of bounds I'll give it to mcce who gets swed so thiago's going to put it up can he make it Thiago will George Hill taking the long three mcce slams it right back in Anderson pumping he's giving it to Thiago Thiago is going up for the layup and he misses but mcce again with the rebound and the shot Hills running the Tony Parker play Dwight Howard just snatched that right out of his hands look at this Dwight Howard says you're ball is my ball what do I got to do I got to give to Tim Duncan Timmy dun you're not making that wow so we're down by five points 754 left in the fourth quarter let's Come Away with the win jobi gives me the ball I give it to Blair Blair gives it back and I'm going to take the three I need to stop taking those so we're down by eight points now we need to start scoring scoring fast I'm going to take this three again the rock I can't make a three-point of this game minutes left in the fourth here's arus good work defensively by job once he gets can I try it again I'm going to try it again here we go I'm feeling good about this one all right that's it I'm done taking threes for the rest of this game job is going to take another three and he keeps missing what what is going on with chinobi and me chinobi two of eight I'm 0 of five wow I took five three-pointers all right Parker let's take this slow we have time up top jobi never wants to take anything slow what kind of shot was that down by 11 points 41 seconds left it's safe to call this it was fun while it lasted can I at least get some garbage points the second half if you can't make shot I can't make it but I get the rebound see if I can make this one so there we have it we lost 93 to 84 it was a rough night from Beyond The Arc tonight you kept on shooting why were you struggling so much from Deep probably because I've got no help out there I know I have to be the man if we're going to win games and sometimes that means taking some threes if I'm not making them then the rest of the guys got to step up and I didn't really see that so I just kept shooting we've seen this before you are currently injured but you're able to play through this injury if you choose to play through it you'll be fully rested in 5 days if you choose to sit out and rest you'll be fully healed in two days and I'm going to sit out cuz I hate walking injured all right let's see what happened when I sat out cuz I probably sat out a game we lost to the Timberwolves 105 to 106 and we lost we just lost the magic 93 to 84 which I blame on no and my five Miss threes but losing to the Timberwolves that's just embarrassing and next game we're going against the Mavericks I'm finally healed for my injury so tune in next time guys"

        "transcript": "Alright so today we\u2019re going to replace\nshocks on a \u201991 Jeep Wrangler. This will work for any of the YJs. So we have the wheel already taken off, the\ncar jacked up, and you can see the shocks are right there. We got the bolts at the top, bolts on the\nbottom. This one is rusted out so we\u2019re going to\nswitch them. So as I\u2019m trying to take off the top bolt,\nit\u2019s a 14 millimeter and as I spin it you can see that the top part of the shock is\nspinning as well. So what I do is I just grab a pair\u2026 and\nthis is alright since we\u2019re just going to throw these shocks away anyway\u2026I\u2019m just\ngoing to grab onto the bar like that with a pair of channel locks and keep on twisting\nthat wrench. The cool thing I like about this wrench is\nit\u2019s got a little ratchet head in there so I don\u2019t have to keep on adjusting it,\nit just always spins on its own. I\u2019ll put a link down at the bottom of the\nvideo so you guys can see how much they cost. I got them off Amazon. They are pretty solid little tools. Anyway, so I\u2019m just going to get rid of\nthat bolt. Ok so when you\u2019re installing the new shocks\nyou just put the bolt in the bottom there. And usually the shocks come bound in some\nkind of way so they don\u2019t stretch out \u2013 it\u2019s easier to ship and stuff. I put the rubber washer and the metal washer\non it and now we just have to extend it up into the housing there. So what I\u2019m going to do is I\u2019m going to\ncut that and it will extend on its own and I just kind of have to guide it in there. It\u2019s a lot easier to lift with two hands,\nI\u2019ll tell you that. And then by its own means it will go right\nup into the top there. And then I\u2019ll put the other washer on top\nwith the little groove there, so it will go down inside the metal housing. And then the nut goes on top of that. So once I tighten it all down, that\u2019s how\nyou install the shocks. Alright so the shocks come with kind of a\nmetal sleeve that goes over the metal part of it so dust and water and stuff doesn\u2019t\ngo down inside of that. It is kind of a good idea to have them. They\u2019re not super super important but, you\nknow, it\u2019s worth having. You can get them for just a couple bucks on\nAmazon. I\u2019ll put a link in the description so you\ncan get some of those if that\u2019s what you want. That\u2019s it. The bottom nut on the shock was a 19 millimeter\nby the way. And yeah, if you have any questions leave\nthem in the comments. If you like what you see make sure to give\nit a \u201clike\u201d. And don\u2019t forget to subscribe. Thanks for watching!"

        "transcript": "\u00c4lmhultsbladet checks out the world\npremiere of a brand new METOD Good morning and welcome!\nI'm thrilled to see so many of you here. Why are we at IKEA launching\na new kitchen range? We do it because life in the kitchen\nhas changed from just cooking. Today we use it for so much more, such as\ndoing homework, socialising and eating. The kitchen has become the hub of the home, and\nthat's why we've developed a new kitchens system. We cannot do the things we want to do and stretch\nits expression as much as we need today. So we made a new system that really gives us a possibility\nto create something more modern and traditional. What's the difference between the kitchen\nwe have today, FAKTUM and the new METOD? The biggest difference is flexibility, that\nMETOD can be built basically any way you want. This really means that the only thing\nsetting the limits is your imagination. There are greater storage\npossibilities with the new system. Additionally, there are improvements on the inside of\nthe kitchen and we have also improved the lighting. How many combinations does\nthe new kitchen offer? They are infinite! We started looking at it, but realized\nthat we think in a different way than our customers will. They will do what they want and need. That's the great thing, that you can find a kitchen\nand realize that you may want it slightly different. It really is possible to\nadapt it to your needs. Which is your favourite\ncombination in the new kitchen? There are many, but what I find genius is the\npossibility to have boxes inside the drawers, so that you don't have to show how\nyou've organised your kitchen. You have a calm, nice expression on the outside,\nwhich is extremely functional on the inside. If you're a traditional customer or a very\nmodern one, who wants big spaces or something, you can still have a super\norganised interior. We know that 70 percent of our customers want a kitchen\nwhere they can spend time with their family and friends, do homework, cook together or sit and just look into\nwhat's happening tonight or what to do tomorrow. It becomes a central hub of the home. After having talked to our customers we know\nthat they need solutions that work for them. Who am I and how do I want to\nlive and be in my kitchen? This is one of the big focus areas when we\nhave developed our new kitchen system, METOD. When will the new kitchen\nbe launched in Sweden? On June 3 in all our stores. Which is your favourite\ncombination in the new kitchen? I don't know about combination, but what I\nlike a lot and that I have some problems with in my own FAKTUM kitchen is being able to make maximum\nuse of the drawers, and we have great solutions here that I really look forward\nto having in my own home."

        "transcript": "hi there today I'm going to show you a uh demonstration on the difference between a diesel engine and a gasoline engine first I'll show you the gasoline engine here we have the Piston which is inside the cylinders with an exhaust valve an intake valve and a spark plug now what happens is the Piston will come down as the crankshaft turns it will pull the Piston down and draw fresh air mixed with gasoline into a nice Vapor mix um draw it in and then um what will happen is after it draws it in all the valves will be closed the crankshaft will continue to turn and push the Piston back up compressing that air that and fuel that was in there then the spark plug will send a little spark into the air fuel mixture that's compressed and it will explode forcing the Piston down and in turn turning the crankshaft then um after at the bottom the crankshaft will then continue to turn pushing the Piston back up the exhaust valve will be open and the exhaust gases will flow out and that completes the cycle on a diesel engine slightly different fresh clean air is drawn in by the Piston with no fuel mixed into it then it is compressed just like before piston will come up and compress it then what's the main difference is what happens now the air will be compressed at a very high pressure and diesel fuel will be injected through an injector and another very high pressure which will cause the diesel fuel to explode simply because it's under such high pressure and that'll just explode forcing the Piston down then just like before the crankshaft will push the Piston up and the exhaust will flow out the parts of these engines are pretty similar you but the main difference is you have a carburetor on the gas engine which um will mix the fuel with the air and make it like a gous mixture like a vapor so that it can burn because gasoline won't burn as a liquid it has to be vaporized in order to burn but it still has the uh intake and exhaust valve and the Poston rod and uh crankshaft but the difference is the spark plug and the uh carburetor which is then compared to just an air filter that will filter the particles out of the air but but then uh no carburetor at all so that the fresh air can go in and an injector which is fed by an injector pump which puts that fuel at a very high pressure and forces it in through the injector into the cylinder but again has the uh piston the connecting rod and the crankshaft all inside the uh cylinder so now I will show you those parts um on actual engines okay first I'm going to show you the gasoline engine parts and this is a 1929 Ford Model A which has one of the simplest uh gasoline engines uh available so it should be a good one for uh demonstration uh there's a carburetor down there that takes air through that filter and then into it up through there it's kind of hard to see up through there and it mixes fuel fuel goes in right there and it mixes inside of there and then comes up through there and into the engine and the valves are in there inside uh the cylinder which is covered by this cylinder head right here and uh so that's the carburetor and then there's the uh spark plugs which stick down into each of the cylinders there's four cylinders and then this is a distributor which sends the spark at exactly the right times through those wires uh into the spark plug which then sends spark into the cylinder as it is needed and uh then the exhaust valves are in there and then it comes out through this header and out and so it that's pretty much the basic design there's not a whole lot to it of course you can't see the the Pistons and stuff are inside of there so but from what you can see out there is the air filter and the carburetor and the intake manifold and then the distributor with the spark plugs and the plug wires now I'm going to show you the diesel engine this is a 1956 Mac B model so it has one of the plainest and simplest diesel engines available also good for demonstration uh as you can see this is the intake manifold right here and air goes in there but notice the lack of a carburetor the air just goes straight in through there and uh you can almost see one of the ports where it goes in through the valve and into the cylinder which this is a six-cylinder engine so there's six Pistons inside of there and then on this side you can see the exhaust manifold where the exhaust comes out through the exhaust valves and then out through there and down and out of the truck and then that is the injector pump now much like the distributor it has six different places on there so that the um six different fuel lines go to six different injectors up there which those send fuel into the cylinders as needed and the injector pump takes fuel in through right there and into that little pump which sends it into the injector pump which then um sends fuel to the different uh fuel lines to the injectors at the right time and then there's the governor on the back which uh is the throttle uh control and also the uh shutdown and it keeps it from over revving the engine and uh so that's pretty much the basic parts of a diesel engine and uh of course you can't see the uh cylinders with the Pistons in them are inside there but uh yeah that's the uh basic parts of a diesel engine okay so now you have seen the basic parts of both a gasoline and a diesel engine and as well as how the uh Cycles are different of the diesel and gas engines and just as a review on a gas gasoline engine the air fuel mixture goes in is drawn in compressed then ignited by a spark plug and then is expelled via the exhaust valves and then a diesel engine fresh clean air is drawn in compressed then fuel is injected at a high pressure and it explodes and then the air is exhausted through the exhaust Valves and so that is the uh main difference between a gasoline and a diesel engine I hope this presentation was useful and if there's any questions please leave it in the comments below thanks for watching"

        "transcript": "what's up guys abyssal day here and today i'm gonna be teaching you guys how to trick shot uh trick shot just practice so let's just jump into this um uh let's see now what you're gonna need to do is you're going to need to make the game type capture the flag that's important you're going to capture the flag but i have mine saved so you don't have to keep changing it after every game now you can do this on any map literally any map as long as you know where you want to trick shot so well this is kind of important so you're going to need you're going to need to follow these okay uh the first two from going too fast please take a picture so capture limit no round limit unlimited round win limit no and that's actually kind of important enemy carrier yes auto return time unlimited pickup time instant and return time no now in general settings i have my mini map on constant that's just a personal preference you can have whatever you want it's to each his own uh spawn is kind of important as well no respawn delay that's kind of a trademark of capture the flag and you don't really want that now um you're also going i also have the health at 80 percent it's whatever you want so i don't get hit markers but if you do see me because i and you're gonna need three bots with on recruit and it's whatever bots you want doesn't matter i prefer three i recommend three um you're also going to need a class with tack inserts um on putting camel on here one second and now you're gonna need tack inserts okay now um i'll show you guys how to start how to practice trick shotting basically i'm not really the biggest trick shot or trick shotting isn't really my thing i'm more of a quickscoper i prefer quick scoping i prefer doing that i'm not exactly good at that mic i built my own controller so my controller isn't my rotation on the sticks isn't as good it's not as fluid so you're going to want to pick the class that you have your um attack insert on now what you're going to need to do is you have to run full speed as as fast as you can to the enemy flag so uh you know take down a couple people i can see them with my radar you know i don't have to worry just grab the flag okay what you're going to need to do is grab the flag and if they grab the flag kill them of course just survive just with the flag okay now kill anyone in your way and kill the flag carrier if there is a flat period what you're going to need to do is you're going to need to catch you're going to need to put down attack insert somewhere okay preferably somewhere up high okay so we're going to need to put down there so so what you're going to need to do is once you put down the tack insert um you're going to respond there of course now the thing about responding there is as you saw the flag is up there and the bots are going to continuously just stand there and just huddle around the flag so what you're going to need to do is it's good practice for not only trick shotting but quick scoping drag scoping no smoothing just to hone your skills you know they just stand there uh you don't need someone to just dummy for you like you know just at perfect practice for anything and of course the shots off i'm failing but um what you need to do is i keep missing the flag um you know put attack insert down somewhere somewhere before you get to high ground um make sure the bots means the bots will kill you now go to where you want the bots to be if you're trick shotting so as you see i'm standing here waiting to kill me they're not telling me uh they're taking forever all right so now you're going to see the bots are going to be standing around there they're going to be the dummy they're just going to be dummies they'll move around a little bit you can throw some shock charges or stun grenades or something but um that's up to you if you really want to if you want to use that for your trick shot whatever so now you're going to need to put down attack insert up high make sure you know it's somewhere i forgot to put down there but yeah you wanna you should they'll be there just stand right there and you're just gonna wanna keep going as much as you want now if you're going on carrier and you wanna do a suicide jump you can put it somewhere you do the suicide jump and put down attack insert and come back and you know it's just over and over do whatever you want right now if you want to move it and move it to like further out further out and kill you now they can't pick up the ball uh the flag and return it so you're going to continuously have bots be sitting there now um the bots may go back if you kill them and grab your flag but that's if they do that then just kill them but um you know the time is unlimited so you can practice how much you want and end the game so you can watch the kill cam so you know just to go for trick shots i really like that good trick shots but um and you know you want to grab here and you start shooting make sure they kill you stand still and let them kill you and um yeah so it's just a very just a process that takes a little bit of time um you can also use them for target practice just drag scoping quick scoping and then just if you want to you know revert to the other side you can do that um you know just you know just die and like the flag will be there people just sitting there you don't have to do it every time though you do not have to pick up the flag every time i'm just doing that on accident i'm not really i'm landing on top of the flag whenever i trick shot i'm not really like a trickshotter so i don't understand how to do it but this is for those who are trying to learn how to shot or become beginners or who are beginners and stuff like that i've learned from people like infrared i watch his video on this so i thought i'd tell you guys also if you're going to do a suicide shot or anything like that right um you can pick up the flag and move it wouldn't really recommend it i mean you don't have to you're not going to be picking it up repeatedly so the fly will be there in that same spot for the rest of the game so you know i grab a flag and i'm gonna flips i'm gonna flip the spot uh my flag is right there though so you have to watch out for the enemy box to try to get it so you know just waiting for the box move um you know just waiting for the box to come kill me if they do great they don't you know just come on our flag carried out um you know just it's just for practice you know i didn't put down attack and sir it's really important that you get attack insert so you know this is basically just just tips on how to practice because it's nice double clap there but um just you know just how to practice trick shotting so thank you guys for watching and i hope to see you guys next time thanks"

        "transcript": "what's up guys Jared here and this is the world's smallest earpiece and it works off of induction technology it's from a company called manorian and up until a little while ago when government agencies finally released this Tech to the general public this type of thing was only available to security agencies and the police so let's take a look at what we get in the Box uh well for starters it comes with two earpieces with an extraction rod and a separate extraction magnet a microphone three push button switches the control unit a micro USB charging cable and the inductor ring so how does it all work well basically you connect the inductor ring to the Bluetooth control unit and then toss the ring around your neck then you simply pop in either one or both ear pieces in each ear give your head a little shake so that it falls down into your eardrum scary sounding I know but it's really not that bad and then pair your phone to the Bluetooth control unit the audio is then sent from the control unit through the inductor ring and then wirelessly transmitted to the earpieces and from there depending on what you want to do with it you can connect the microphone to the control unit and attach it to your clothing so that you can talk to a recipient at the other end while in a call and when you're done using it just take either the magnet or the extraction Rod Place either of them in your ear and the ear pieces just pops out instantly now taking a closer look at the control unit aside from the loop input which is for the inductive ring and the microphone input uh there's a power switch Bluetooth pairing button a micro USB port for charging the internal battery which can last up to 6 hours and then there's the back yeah the back has a lot going on here from left to right we start with with the beep report which is where those push button switches go this is where covert communication can take place where by pressing the push button you'll send a signal to the recipient on the other end of the call so if you wanted to you could come up with things like one signal for yes and two signals for no that sort of stuff just do me a favor and don't bring this into a casino otherwise you'll get in big big trouble if caught and then next to that is our media control Port so still using the push button switches you can pause and play or skip forward and back and you can even fast forward or Rewind by long pressing you can also do things like long press to answer a call end a call or even redial the last dial number now if you are interested in using this for basically covert anything what's neat is that once it's paired with your device a bluo discoverability filter activates and prevents anyone from even seeing that the manorian pro even exists so obviously you're all wondering how it's sounds well I can tell you that for something half the size of a grain of rice it sounds great honest to God it sounds good like we're not talking Audio Technica studio monitor good but there's actually a bit of base with this thing my only complaint is that it doesn't quite get as loud as I would like and the inductor ring cable is a few inches too short and with both earpieces in each ear at the same time it's like wearing a pair of headphones but what's cool too is that you can still hear the world around you perfectly which actually brings me to who something like this would be suited for well I'm sure you can probably come up with a bunch of different scenarios where something like this might come in handy and aside from the obvious maybe not so legal uses as well as its intended use to cheat on tests I was thinking this would be great for actors or someone giving speeches where they might need to have lines fed to them I mean I can go on listing all the uses I thought of but I figured I'd see what you guys can come up with in the comments down below now as far as the price is concerned although this is a really fun piece of tech 600 bucks in my opinion is quite a bit of cash considering I found several of its competitors selling the same thing with just a few less options for hundreds less anyways if you wanted to pick one up for yourself or even just take a look at the information in more detail I'll have a link in the description below for you guys but that's it for this one if you like the video do me a solid and hit the like button and don't forget to subscribe if you haven't already well thanks as always for watching and I'll talk to you all in the next one cheers"
