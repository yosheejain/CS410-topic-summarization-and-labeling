        "transcript": "[Music] the highly anticipated Star Wars Battlefront is now shipping for those not in the know Star Wars Battlefront is a battlefield 1942 style teamb based shooter set in the Star Wars Universe the game offers large Maps dozens of players and plenty of drivable Vehicles the game offers two different single player modes one is the historical Campaign which includes two linear campaigns that follow the story arcs from the Star Wars films the other Galactic Conquest which is a more open-ended campaign that allows you to choose the order in which you attack enemy controlled planets each planet you control offers a different special bonus these range from sabotage which causes your opponent's vehicles to spawn in with heavy damage to Jedi hero which allows you to fight alongside a nearly Invincible NPC controlled Jedi such as Darth Vader or mace Wu despite the special bonuses in the galactic Conquest mode it doesn't play out much differently from the regular campaign Battlefront includes four playable factions based on the two different time periods from the movies these include the rebels and the Empire from the late 70s and early ' 80s films as well as the Republic clone Warriors and the separatist droid army from the newer films each of the four factions has five distinct classes you've got regular soldiers heavy weapons troops and snipers there's also a pilot who's kind of like a cross between a medic and an engineer the Pilot's best ability is being able to automatically repair Vehicles while driving them each Army has a fifth specialized class that helps distinguish the four factions the rebels Can field tough wooky Smugglers armed with bowc casters both the Empire and the Republic field soldiers equipped with jetpacks that allow them to get to high places or just travel a lot faster the best one is arguably the Droid Army's droa those who have seen episode one will remember the droa is the rolling Destroyer robot that wields rapid fire blasters and a personal Shield Battlefront includes 16 different Maps spread out over 10 different planets ranging from The Forest of Andor to the Rain swept oceans of Camino as in Battlefield 1942 players must capture specific spots on the map called command points your team responds at command points as do vehicles so it's important to protect the ones that you control and capture ones away from your enemy some maps are more vehicle oriented and some are more infantry oriented but the best part of Battlefront is the vehicles it's quite exhilarating to fly about in a TIE fighter or an X-Wing and provide ground support or stomp around in an atst or other tank-like vehicles and blast hapless infantry Geonosis is probably the best vehicle map as it includes Droid spider Walkers and Hailfire tanks against the six-legged atte of the Republic army as well as heavily armed Air transport ships there's any complaint to be leveled against the vehicles in Battlefront is that they're rather overpowered relative to the Infantry especially if they're being driven by a skilled player using the pilot class spawn camping with a large vehicle is a cheap and easy way to rack up kills and lead your team to an easy capture Battlefront offers a pretty simple but flexible interface you can switch between first and third person and most Primary Weapons also offer one level of Zoom but aiming is relatively easy anyway especially on the console versions where auto aim is on by default battlefields brand of Auto aiming is especially sticky which unfortunately takes a lot of the skill out of head-to-head standoffs in the console versions multiplayer modes the platforms begin to distinguish themselves from one another on the graphics front the PS2 version is clearly the weakest of the three offering blurrier textures and no shadowing in comparison the Xbox and PC offer more vibrant colors and sharper textures as well as additional detail on all the soldier and vehicle models overall the graphics on all three platforms are respectable relative to other Shooters there are also a lot of differences between the different platforms as far as online support goes the PC version offers sport for up to 32 players online while Xbox Live and PS2 online support up to 16 human players with Bots used to fill out the maps however the PS2 version only supports 16 human players when you use special software that you have to run on a PC if you want to run a server on your PS2 you're limited to just four human players plus 12 additional Bots because of those issues PS2 is clearly the weakest for online play but it's pretty good on both the Xbox and PC versions and we'll have to give the nod to the PC here for supporting more players overall Star Wars Battlefront delivers a satisfying team based shooter experience that hardcore Star Wars fans will enjoy greatly for most PC shooter fans though the game may come off as old hat aside from the Star Wars Universe Battlefront doesn't really deliver anything PC players haven't seen before although it's a solid game in its own right the game might be more fresh and appealing to console players who don't have as many choices in online team based shooters [Music]"

        "transcript": "hey guys it's Holly and today I have two of the Littlest Pet Shop mommy and baby sets to show you guys now I was sent these from our viewer Brooke at XX books alive 22xx so thank you so much Brook for sending these to me because we have not been able to find these anywhere and I've really been wanting them I have the pig set and the Elephant set to show you guys these are for ages four and up and on the back it shows the other pets that you can get there is a tiger a bird a poodle and a doxen set they're just so cute it says collect them all these are by Hasbro and it has a little quote that says two pets for twice the fun this stylish mommy and baby love to go everywhere together and both boxes say the same little quote on the back so let's open them up and take a closer look okay I'm going to start with the elephant set I do want to point out in the corner here it says Bobble with style so I'm guessing one or both of them are bobbleheads I can tell the baby looks like a bobblehead the mom doesn't look like one so much but I guess we'll find out when we open it up so this comes with the mommy the baby and an accessory oh and of course it's held in with rubber bands oh well that wasn't too hard to do it looked like it was going to be more difficult than that that wasn't so bad so here we have the mommy and the mommy is a light purple with some dark purple across the top of her head she has yellow and orange eyes and then she has this really cute pink bow in her hair and I love how her toenails are painted pink I think that is so cute and then she's got the little LPS on the back of her head she's kind of posing this back leg is um um bent a little bit and then her front legs are kind of bent as well and she's got this cute just adorable little smile I love it and kind of a smaller trunk if you guys remember I did the um Little's Pet Shop blind bags and I got an elephant in one of those and I was so surprised cuz I hadn't seen an elephant before so I think it's really cool that I now have another elephant um the one I got in The Blind Bag had a much larger trunk though so that's kind of a little different I love that little bow I said in her hair I guess it's on her ear she doesn't really have hair and then the baby is the same the light purple with the darker purple across the top of its head the baby has blue eyes it's so tiny oh my gosh now I don't see any bobbling in the head maybe a little bit in the mommy head but not a lot like I wouldn't think that would be really a bobblehead but so cute the eyes are kind of more of like a a teal like a turquoise color there's the back so adorable oh my gosh and the accessory is a little baby bottle it's just a white bottle with like the little lines to show you how full the bottle is with blue around the lid and a blue top that is so cute so you have a little bottle that you can feed your baby with there's no like hole in its mouth but you know you can pretend oh my gosh this is just so cute I'm going to set them up just like this for display adorable love it and it also has a pamplet in there in the box so let's see what's in the pamplet oh okay so it just shows basically like some of the new set that you can get really cute I'm going to have to look at that maybe pick out some other sets let me know if you guys want me to do more Littlest Pet Shops okay let's move on to the pig and when I opened these up in the package that Brook sent us my daughter went nuts for this pig so I might not get to keep this pig for very long let's pull out the baby cuz the baby is really easy to get out and the Mommy's going to be held in with rubber bands like crazy oh Break Free mommy Break Free there we go that wasn't so bad okay so mommy again the light pink body with brighter pink hair bright pink nostrils bright pink feet and the eyes are light and and bright pink as well so you kind of got the two-tone pink going throughout the whole body the LPS on the back of the head and this mommy has a blue bow on her ear and that's just held on with little um clear rubber bands so you could take it off if you want to but I think it looks really cute now this one does have a really good Bobble to its head so this one's really bobbly this one not so much maybe if you play with it a little bit it would probably start to Bobble more I don't know but the pig really does Bobble a lot so that's pretty cool okay let's take a look at the baby the baby basically matches mommy it has light pink body with the brighter pink hair nostrils this baby has a hole in its mouth for its bottle well I wonder why they didn't do that with the elephant the elephant does not have a hole in its mouth and the pig does and the tips of its feet its little hooves are bright pink and the eyes are the same color pink as the body which I would have thought they would do like um some brighter pink in there so it doesn't all blend as much but it's still really cute the accessory is also a bottle for this one and it has yellow and you could put the little bottle in its mouth look at that it even stays if you push it so I have the bottle in its mouth and then you can take it out so you can feed your little baby I think that would have been cute if the elephant would have had the same thing I don't know why but it doesn't so there is the mommy and I dropped the piggy on the floor here we go the pig mommy and baby set so I wented to show you guys what I found inside the pamphlet that was in the package these are some more mom mommy and baby sets that I did not know existed until I looked inside so there is a bear a deer a white tiger the other one was yellow Bulldog squirrel and Bunny and oh my gosh I have to have the deer and I have to have the squirrel and I also really love the bunny they're just all so cute I love them all so much but I wanted to show you guys these in addition to the ones that were on the back of the box because these are some really adorable ones that you can collect as well so here is a closer look at the mommy and baby sets that I got today I want to know which one is you guys' favorite leave it in the comments below I'm going to have to go with the pig set it's really hard to choose between them because they're both so cute but I just love the pigs and then my daughter love the pig so that's just a set that I'm going to have to go with thank you guys so much for watching be sure to comment rate and subscribe bye n"

        "transcript": "hey guys pedin here and the Terraria other World trailer has just been released we're going to be reviewing that and also we're going to be reviewing the Terraria Forum thread that was released as well where it explains in depth about what we should expect from the new Terraria game in comparison to the old one let's take a look shall we before we continue if you want to check out this thread for yourself or watch the trailer um just go down in the description you should be able to find a link down there all right so as you can see this is the thread and what we're going to do is we're going to go through the thread first of all we'll do the trailer later we're going to go through the thread and read out specific parts that really appeal to me and I think show a good reflection on the game and what we should expect okay so if we go down here to the RPG elements part it says includes a core storyline we can kind of see this from the teaser trailer that we saw the other week where it had had like crystals it kind of basically shouts out straight away there's a goal around this new Terraria and then on the next line you see it says NPCs will be on more than just Merchants only just wandering around doing nothing right um so this is pretty cool it it kind of reminds me of the clo there from Terraria first he starts out as just some guy guarding a dungeon right don't go in blah blah blah and then all of a sudden he turns out you you've got to fight this giant Skeletron thing right and then he moves in afterwards all the the the NPCs in the new Terraria of the world are going to have some sort of story and law driven into them they're not just going to be mindless merchants and then on the next line it says the story line will not be a fixed narrative what this means is I think it what it's hinting at is it it will have a story but you don't have to do the story if you don't want to what you can do is just go explore go build things yada yada yada I don't know if they're going to have like a story mode and then like have a sandbox mode it might just be one mode and and then if you don't want to do it just don't do it or maybe there will be a sand moox mode which is just all like just do whatever you want pretty much without any any NPCs trying to bother you for stories and quests like that I'm not sure if there's going to be those two different modes but it'll be interesting to see all right so just below this you see down here skill trees all right skill trees is something brand new they've never done this in the original Terraria this is completely just for Terraria of the world so this is another way to customize your character if you like melee weapons if you like ranging you can increase those skills individually um it's not like a tree where you get a new point you can spend that point and then get like a new move or anything like that it kind of works with like damage I guess if you use swords a lot of the time you get a damage boost or like um your your skills have gone up by this percentage or whatever you know um but there's one quote that I really do like it says use the silver sword all the time and your skill with sword and that particular sword will improve improve so that means there's no correct way to play the game like for example in Terraria everyone knows oh the the best sword is the terror blade and blah blah blah blah blah and then it's just like okay that's your best sword but my best sword is this sword because I've I've trained my character to be really efficient with this weapon and I think this is good and then your friend will be like no I think this weapon's the best because I've trained my charact like it it kind of just made makes the game even more sandboxy there's no definitive one strongest weapon in them all it's all kind of open open to interpretation like if if this sword Works in a different way you're going to prefer that one to your play style cuz everyone plays differently at the end of the day I really do like this uh addition to the game it's fantastic all right so the next part is the strategy elements this is pretty basic um you've seen a lot of this in the trailer and whatnot all the towers and how work um so pretty much basically is this is what the game revolves around this is the kind of story that it ties into there are these gems you find them you set up Towers to defend the gems and whatnot like that there's a quote that I like it says even the best Terraria players can't defend the whole map so it encourages you to make these defenses because if you get a crystal congratulations and you walk off and do something else that Crystal is going to get taken by the corruption or enemies around that area so you need to set up these towers in order to make sure the crystal is defended and who knows maybe there'll be like bosses that all of a sudden come out of nowhere and are trying to take your Crystal and you have to get there as fast as possible to defend your area it's like your base it's under attack right so I kind of like that idea it gives you an objective but you don't have to do it if you don't want to it's it's pretty cool an idea and if you take a look at the uh image down below you'll see there's spikes there's a flamethrower there's rocket launchers there's like Gatling gun many ways to keep these enemies out of your base so I'm I'm kind of interested to see what sort of defenses there are as well okay so last but not least we've got availability for this thread um so it's going to be coming out for PC and Mac that is guaranteed PlayStation 4 and Xbox One will be coming out further down the line also they're going to be self-published as well meaning no 505 games so the games from PC to consoles are going to be much more truer for example right now in Terr Tera we have half of the content in Terraria PC and then in Terraria console you have all sorts of random bosses like the turkey one and some other other things that just don't fit in the game in my opinion and and even the art style seems a bit off like the Thanksgiving turkey looks a bit like it was done in paint in my opinion um so yeah that's that and also there's no Early Access mainly because the original terrar had some issues with that back in the day and they probably don't want to repeat all righty so next I'm going to be going and taking pieces from the trailer and showing you guys some interesting stuff all right let's take a look shall we the corruption Crystal Caves wings and what may be seen as the underworld here you can see what looks like the dungeon also there's destructive terrains with the rocket launcher here's the defense Ive section this is what we talked about earlier where you can set up Towers to defend your crystals as you can see in the center okay in this next one you can see the corruption slowly getting taken away from the crystal in the center you can see slowly see the original Overworld coming back here you can see the Rocks slightly coming over all the corruption and here you can see the snow taking away the corruption as well the crystal works as a hot point to get rid of all corruption in the area pretty cool stuff and here you can see a non-hostile NPC okay so that was the whole thread in a nutshell pretty much I'm I'm kind of glad I got this all under wrapped under 10 minutes I covered the whole trailer I covered like the all of the text in the thread so I hope you guys enjoyed the work I put into this um so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed the video and I'll see you guys later bye"

        "transcript": "hello and welcome to tbh games my name is beta rowan today we are back with some smite i have really been enjoying this game recently uh i said in my first video that i'm not a big fan of melee characters in mobas and i am actually playing a melee character you're about to see um his name is sun woo kong he is uh of the i don't know if they call it asian or chinese but basically in smite you have a few different houses there's the nords the greeks the egyptians and i i'm i'm assuming chinese uh and he is a melee character he's kind of sneaky a little bit of an assassin although i don't know if they qualify classify him as that and what you're looking at in this gameplay are basically any time uh i get a kill or die and that one was absolutely terrible i was overextended because i was still very very weak i hadn't buffed health at all and i managed to get literally every hit possible out of ra's ultimate so that was unlucky now here their son wukong jumps up uh right into my ultimate which is i to me one of the most powerful ultimates in the game uh and i i can't believe that uh they both got away from us but uh for most of the game it was me and my lane partner here emir that ice character uh who was playing really well and i had a laugh though right here i say he was playing well uh yeah his his ice wall kind of kept us from that kill but that's all right uh so back back to what's going on with sun woo kong uh he's a little bit of a jungler uh you know you can use them to pop out and so many of my kills are just this right here where i'm just walking through the jungle with my somersault which is your number one uh i guess if this was league of legends you call it your q it's uh your first move and it it's extremely powerful because i mean not only are you jungling but you kind of can get very quickly out of the jungle before they even know what's going on it does do damage when you come down now here i get snared but look at all of them here and i think i get one kill out of this so that's what i just did right there very powerful combination you somersault out and then you drop your ultimate which is that um what is it called uh year of the monkey like not positive it's the ultimate basically uh it disables the other characters they run in circles they run opposite of your controls basically uh do i do exactly that again no that's just somersault into melee i apologize in advance if you get some lag on the video this was my first time using dxtory or dx3 however you want to pronounce it uh and i didn't drop any of my settings so i'm running uh i'm recording basically on the same drive i'm i'm running off of and doing that in 1080p uh in high def and all high settings didn't really go too well so i get the kill right there basically off that same move and i really like him uh as a character now i was very squishy in the beginning i i wasn't really handling my stats all that well and i'm apologize right now because i didn't write down what the items were i will try to go back and see and maybe in another video i'll mention them but right off the bat you're obviously going to want to get your boots the get the boots that are recommended uh that's one cool thing about uh smite is they do have a recommendation tab you know like most other games do but it's right there and it's the things that you would auto purchase if you leave the auto purchase on um get those but then you're going to want to buff your uh your actual physical damage because you are a physical character with your auto attacks you will get kills with your auto attacks um and then do a lot of health uh i personally did uh physical damage uh buffs against you know for defense i only kept that in right there because if you notice i jump directly through raw's one attack or q again whatever you want to call it no damage i don't know if that's a glitch if they're going to take that out but there's no vertical damage on his attack which is kind of nice to know so we're getting to the end game here and i've already shown you how uh sun wu kong's ultimate can be used offensively i mean it's great it disables them and if you've got a little bit of a lane partner you guys can wreck but here we're taking down their phoenix and i don't think i speed up or anything so uh my lane partner again emir throws up a few ice walls which kind of throwed off what i was going to go for and that was their emir freezing me so uh actually it's a good thing he froze me because it stopped my alt when i shouldn't have been using it anyway so we were thinking about pushing in but then all of a sudden i realized that amir does he take off without me i can't remember what happens but basically i end up throwing my alt to confuse them uh and then that lets you kind of hightail it out of there i end up uh you know casting back right there from right outside their spawn uh because they can't move so it does buy you enough time and from here on out this is the end game uh we take this phoenix down i boldly sacrificed myself because uh this other team wasn't that great you can see that in the final stats so there is no reason of uh you know taking a bunch of time with uh the minotaur in here so i i somersault in i throw a few spells and i i do a lot of damage to the minotaur but i go down and then i die so very quick right here at the end if you guys don't already know i am giving away uh it looks like at this point i have two beta keys to give away do not do anything on this video you probably saw a link at the beginning of the video and i'll have one right now to go to my first smite video uh uh just leave a comment make sure you're subscribed and you will be good to go for the giveaway for one of the two beta keys thanks guys"

        "transcript": "what's up guys my name is concept and you have read the title right this is a knife or a combat knife nuclear and the reason i want to get this clear work really quick uh the reason i didn't put knife only in the title it's because i believe i got eight c4 kills and i i know some people don't really like the c4 and feel like it's kind of a newbie thing to put in a gameplay uh but i really feel like some of these situations i kind of needed the c4 but some of the situations i really didn't need the c4 i just used it to make the game play a little bit faster and i'll try to point that out when i see it but there is one point of the game where i just killed the galaxy 4 just because it would make the game a little bit more faster paced and i didn't want to um make this game really slow so there is a lot of cuts uh this is around i think eight minute nuclear uh of course it's knife only okay there are eight right there i could have killed the guy with the knife because he was afk but i see four of them just make the game a little bit quicker i just wanted to get that out there but i do have a little bit of a comment to topic for this video and that is knifing and call of duty and i really feel that in cult of the ghost it kind of ruined the knifing and you guys may agree may not agree uh but i think like the five second like animation that you get when you knife is kind of excessive uh you don't really need that long of a knife and call of duty and i found myself dying a lot just because that long of a knife i like the knife in this game because it's quick it really goes fast you don't have to worry about uh having a huge animation don't have to worry about getting killed in your knife but the non-lock-on knife is kind of annoying in my opinion you kind of have to be aiming right at him uh which some people may agree it's kind of good but i feel like the knifing in this game could have used a little bit of a tweak uh but nonetheless the knifing this game is pretty good i feel like the best knifing call of duty ever was in mj3 i felt like it was kind of balanced they were still panic knifing but it really didn't affect the game that much uh but nonetheless i want to go into my uh preferred perks when i'm going knife only which is pretty much not that much i got this gun golden uh back when the game like round when it first came out in november of 2012 i think i'm not sure i'm pretty sure it was 2012 um but that's when i got this in gold i used it a little while when there was like nuketown 24 7 and stuff like that so my like main attachment that i really recommend you use is lightweight you run really really fast when you run lightweight on a knifing class so that's one and then uh dead silence you may you may not agree with that but in closer range maps dead sounds will come in handy uh i really don't use that sound that much in this game but i guess on knifing classes it really does help another one this is just mainly i want to get this out there real quick uh speed perks definitely try to get as many speed perks as you can on the class it'll really help you out really be able to get you around the map a lot quicker but the third perk is marathon i use marathon a lot of my classes uh just because or not a lot of my classes i use marathon on my knifing classes in my special like special category of guns classes uh just because i like to move around the map a lot just so i can get a lot of the kills like the crossbow was super hard uh you kind of really need marathon to get around the map and that but from a nuclear like standpoint if you want to go for an iphone nuclear and i know i know a lot of people like want to but it's kind of hard to be honest uh definitely run scavenger uh if you're running like concussion grenades that'll really help i do concussion grade like a few people in this game place that i can get the kill uh and getting gush grids a lot will really help you on your streaks so this video is coming to an end this is actually a pretty insane gameplay so if you guys have enjoyed this i really would like to hit 20 likes the support has been absolutely amazing i have pulled a hundred views and 20 plus likes on all of my videos i posted since i came back and i really feel like i want to keep that trend going i really think this gameplay can easily hit 100 100 views and maybe even 20 likes i know you guys really really like these insane gameplays so i'll try to keep going for them so this has been a concept and i just want to say thank you guys for watching leave a like if you have enjoyed if you haven't already be sure to subscribe but my most concept i'm out peace you"

        "transcript": "welcome to Fantastic realm I'm Yar and this is your weekly Round Up of the latest books to hit your comic book store shelves this week we have a couple of real interesting compendium Comics The Last knockings of The Secret Invasion and the first fruit of the dark rain first up this week we've got a couple of really interesting compendiums from boom Studios we've got this one thei tals and this zombie tals and what's really good about both of these books is that you don't need to have read any back issues or know anything about the continuity of either book to kind of um enjoy them straight away now what each has is three short stories based on the theme on the cover so we have three kind of zombie theme stories in Zombie Tales and three kind of lovecrafting kind of monster tales in cthulu Tales um all of the stories are beautifully realized in terms of their art though they are very very different styles from story to story and each of the stories has a little twist or a little kind of um hook that makes each one of them well worth reading so both of these books represent pretty good value in terms of that you're getting three kind of whole stories that you can kind of consume in one go in the one book and the both are on your shelves this week and well worthy of your attention cthulu tals and zombie tales on your shelves this week so while we're on the subject of compendium Comics here's a new one from Marvel now this is dark rain new nation number one and here we find collected five stories that act like prologues for five new series that we're going to see from Marvel in 2009 and based on this reading there seem to be two Series in particular that jumped out that are going to be essential reading that are going to be part of dark rain as we go into the new year and those two stories were firstly secret Warriors the brand new Nick Fury story and also um war machine which is always he's always been a little bit of a b character like because he was a sidekick to Iron Man Who was never necessarily the most popular character before but this looks like a really really good setup for a new series for him and and this book in general even though um more of the stories were less interesting to me than not um it seems to be a good place to pick up a dark rain and see whether any of the books that are going to be part of it are going to be things that you're going to want in your life so if you want to get a hand on dark rain grab this dark rain new nation number one on your shelves this week so also hit in your stands this week is this Mighty Avengers number 20 it's spill as secret Invasion the epilog and what it does is functions really well as a kind of last knockings of secret Invasion set up for the dark rain and there are two really good things about this book the first is that it kind of really um makes Hank Pim a sympathetic character who and you really feel some of what he's going through in the aftermath of the secret Invasion and two um the art is a really really beautifully um realized art with lovely colors and really nice Fine Line work and I really enjoyed it so um if you want to kind of uh enjoy the last of the secret Invasion and set yourself up for the dark rain you could do a lot worse than this this is mighty Avengers number 20 hitting your stands this week also out this week is Invincible Iron Man number eight now like a lot of people I kind of got more into Iron Man off the back of the movie this year which was um really good and we really enjoyed Robert dowley junor as Tony Stark and that whole realization of it was wicked and going back and enjoying some back issues of Iron Man and Iron Man extremist and everything I really gotten into the character and this is great I really enjoyed this book this is basically the um the aftermath of the secret invasion you know Tony Stark has been deposed as the head of shield shield no longer exists um Stark uh you know Stark uh Industries is in huge kind of problems and and Tony is basically the bad guy now you know um and this is great you know with Norman Osborne is the good guy and Tony's the bad guy and they're kind of setting up to kind of be at each other's throats in the course of this and it looks great I enjoyed it and what the the best thing about this book is that it's not that it doesn't wallow in Tony Stark's kind of depression having been deposed you know he's gone from being the guy in control of the world to you know basically a schnook but it's got a lot of humor in this book it's not depressing it's not down this is the guy who's going to face his trials and tribulations in a positive way and do something and um i' really enjoyed it so if you get a chance to check it out I would highly recommend it the Invincible Iron Man number eight on your stands this week there are a couple other comic books around this week um for people who been following new Krypton we get to part number eight it's in Supergirl this week also out this week Deadpool hits issue number five it's achingly funny and action-packed as ever the relentlessly Grim Walking Dead from Robert Kirkman hits number 56 on Image Comics this week The Amazing Spider-Man is up to issue 581 with more Revelations about Harry Osborne in that one we've got G Enis and Steve Dylan's Punisher War Zone on Marvel

        "transcript": "and now it reacts as a double strum okay if you can do it back and forth up here if you are real guitarist I'm sure you've done this before you can possably take a pick and sit here in the same string forever and ever and ever and you'll never touch any of the other strings but my concern is a lot of people watching this video right now is in the gaming Market not the real guitar market and they're looking for this guitar to be able to do things in the game I'm not going to tell you you can't learn it and a matter of fact I think it may give you an extra reason to play the game maybe maybe it brings the game back maybe it makes the game a little bit more fun for you now but it's going to be a learning curve so I don't want you to go pick up a guitar and say hey I can get 99% on almost easy and whip it out on your regular guitar and you pick up the UR Rock and you go I can only get 75% that's going to happen like any other guitar it is a learning curve because it is a different way to play the game so in closing what do I think of the U guitar I think the U guitar is an innov ative measure I think it's done very well however I think in gaming purposes if you are a hardcore rock band gamer if you're like me you know you run a rock band team you play on a rock band team like PMS H2O you're a competitive player and you're and you're just not casual the you rock guitar may or may not be for you that is going to be the option in which you have but if you are casual and you just want to dink around with it and you're not looking for scores and things of that nature the you are guitar is going to be perfect for you if you just want a Midi Guitar to learn guitar or to enhance what you already know on guitar and you want something that is going to be less money to put into a computer the UR rock is for you Ur Rock goes for about $180 so $180 fromit guitar versus $22,000 is a huge saving and it's a huge step so giving it to you straight Gamers if you are hardcore you may want to think about this purchase because of the fact that if you buy trying it solely for the game it is going to take you some time to get acclimated to it not saying you can't but if you are used to just picking up a guitar and being able to Ratt off 9.99 or 100% it is not going to happen with this guitar however if you want to take the time out to learn this and you want to take the time to figure out how you can do the fast drums accurately this may be for you so I'm not going to tell you too b or not I leave it up to you with the information that I'm able to bring forth to you as you know again I'm going to give it to you straight in my opinion personally would I buy the UR Rock I would buy the UR Rock solely to learn guitar if I wanted to do that or to put it in Cakewalk the one other thing I didn't discuss which let me discuss that real quick cuz I think it's very important is they do have a UR Rock mode now all of your panels of CHR I didn't show you that is all right here I come a little Clos it's all right here uh where all your panels and stuff is okay so you have your music your game your open your slide your tap your Ur Rock B guitar synth track and midi the UR Rock bod actually for person like me who just wants to pick up guitar and try to learn would do it now say you hit uck mode and you want to learn um a song and the song is just say in the key of f well anything outside of the key of f is not going to allow you to play because it's going to give you this chirping sound and it's going to mute the it's going to mute the keyboard therefore whenever you're able or the fretboard I'm sorry therefore when you're able when you get back into the key of f every core progression in the key of f is going to play for you I think that is very ingenious the other thing that is ingenious about it is how you connect it to the game which is right here okay this right here is the pack you put in which they call the game flag and this is the Wii cartridge so if you have a Wii PS2 PS3 or Xbox 360 you need one of these CS this card snaps right into the bottom right here into your guitar and this is how by Bluetooth you're able to get this guitar to play with the game so if you do have this guitar the good point about it is is it will play with every system if you purchase one of these cars I think one of these cars go for about $25 uh a piece okay so my personal opinion to EUR rock is if I was to Market this I think I would say you know it says go from gaming to playing guitar I said go from Guitar into gaming because I think it's more suitable that way a lot of people will buy this guitar I think to start learning and they say hey I can now that I've know how to play guitar I can cross this over and go into a actual game and play that so once again casual players are recommended highly people who are like be who either play competitively or they play guitar all the time and they're really radical about rock band which is probably about 6 60% of my audience then I would say think about it think about what I've said try to get your hands on one but I'm not going to say it's a bad product cuz I don't think that it is I I don't think there's any limitations to the UR rocket guitar at all um especially if learning guitars or thing so for those of you out there that that's written me and say we want a real guitar in the game this right here my friends the EUR rock guitar is the closest thing right now barring anything that harmonics may have up their sleeve we don't know about for Rock Band 3 you're going to get okay real strings never needs tuning strings never break if they do break EUR Rock could take care of that but from the way it's construct I don't think it's ever going to break okay so that's basically my Ur Rock review um if you have any questions comments you know how to do that WR down below here leave me some comments if you're watching this on my website there's also a way to comment right below there just sign in anonymously or with your Facebook or Twitter and you'll be able to go right there all right and you can leave me a comment I can read it in real time and I can respond to you so again you rock guitar $180 www. rock.com right now if you want to go and get the extra uh C or the extra songs for it when it is is released this has not been released yet I don't know when I think sometime in April they're looking at finally releasing these so just want to get you guys' opinion uh on what you think about it and let the company know what you feel and if this is something you would actually purchase um again whenever I get one at my house I plan on doing videos for you guys to show you if I'm learning guitar I'm going to try to learn guitar off of the UR Rock and show you how easy that that that's going to be I'm also going to sit and mess around with it and try to acclimate myself to playing it and Guitar Hero in Rock Band cuz it can be done I just want you guys to think that out the box you're going to whip it out and go hey this is the bomb it's easy 99% like I usually do because you it is going to be a learning curve all right so I think that's it guys so until next time uh you know if you want to get a hold of me you know how to how to do that caas corner.com on my address the web www.c corner.com and uh or leave me comments down here or you write me on YouTube all right so until next time Peace Love keep rocking out and we catch you guys on the next review"

        "transcript": "talking about the grip right now and here's what we want you guys to do how you prepare the record is a premium how you prepare the racket if you're messing around in the beginning it's going to lead to problems the game is 20 miles faster than say six or seven years ago the ball is rotating so much faster and everything by all indications it's going to get even quicker so preparation and how you prepare your stroke is at an all-time high so here's the game plan when the ball comes over the net you're always going to take the racket back with your shoulder you'll always take the racket back with the shoulders you don't let the racket go back by itself the shores initiate your backswing so you're always going to be taking the racket back all right the ball this way I'm going to take the racket back with my shoulders now what I'm talking about is from the baseline the bread-and-butter that we how you do this stroke if you're running forward that's something if you wouldn't be doing what I'm saying I'm talking maybe from the baseline all right so here comes the ball watch what I'm taking it back might take the racket that my shoulders are turning my racket head is pretty much up you can have a little tilted that doesn't really matter right now and I'm gonna turn and I'm gonna keep turning and I keep turning until I feel a stretch on my left shoulder there's this guy his name's better I don't let people hurting him you elected he turns his hands go straight back he keeps his left hand on the racket it goes all the way to here no let go his arm goes across the body his arm is at a 90 degree angle that means this down boom the forearm is parallel to the baseline just like at every time right here so the dirty works been done so if you go like this I don't think you're gonna do what I'm gonna say because I know what's gonna happen you're gonna go the other way you're gonna do an old-school stroke you're gonna go the wrong way you've got to get the first part you should take it back where you feel something there you do that it's huge the number one mistake forget how you hit the ball the number one mistake if someone asked me what have you seen in 30 years is the most common mistake on the forehand it's easy people don't turn it up that's why you see a lot of people on the tour their back hands are much better with two hands because less goes wrong with two hands because your body stays connected one hand you know you're all over Texas or Arizona or Utah or whatever the racket goes everywhere no you got to keep your left hand on and you keep it on all the way feel a stretch in your left shoulder there's a 90 degree angle your arm is parallel to the baseline you should be able to put maybe a softball between here and here okay put something between there you have to have it away from the body here's what happens a lot of yet because you're little you want more power you want a bigger swing some people might even teach that all right I'm not saying that's wrong I'm just saying it becomes more problematic when you get older the elbow is too close if your elbow is too close when you take it back I guarantee you're gonna go like this you're gonna take the racket that way and that's to the insult misses inside this is going to be outside when the elbows in the forearm or this joint angle goes that way no one's gonna go this way I'm gonna have 10,000 people go like this and like that if you're here you're going that way because you're gonna just go like that and you'll make a semicircular swing low to high you'll make a nice little loop our rainbow banana candy cane ferris wheel whatever you want to say and you'll do this and I'm not saying that's wrong takes more time you wonder why the coach is telling you your jam you're late could be because your feet will all we're talking about mechanics you can picture how many time you see joke if it's better right these guys like that you always see them like that and everybody says yeah get your arms straight get your arm away you can't do it if the elbow is six inches behind your body so you take it back pretend there's someone behind you you're gonna nut you poop all right get the elbow back not same high just take your hand straight back left hand on the rack all the way to here 90-degree angles the arm is parallel thereby with me if you're like this you got a shot if you take it back like this it's not gonna work I'm telling you right now you have to have it away the great Agassi the AXI in the body so the best groundstrokes ever pushed it away from the bottom he does exactly what I'm saying okay the best of the best of the best 100% do exactly what I'm saying okay they're away from the body they're not in here the racket has to go here"

        "transcript": "whoa I know what you're thinking this is not team a PS of course not it's tom box from MST TV and I hijacked their channel so i can post my content just kidding we're doing a video swap so stay tuned hey guys tom boxer from chemistry TV welcome to team aps and today i was sharing with you guys a top five list normally a pretty positive person so you know to contrast that i'm going to share with you my top five ways to BM your opponent in you you I'm not talking about trash-talking them I'm gonna let the cards in the talking as they know they can choose not to listen to you I rather have them scoop and be salty then to me actually being an [\u00a0__\u00a0] how does my list compiled well first of all you have to tack in bad cards into your deck to show them who's boss and nothing's more satisfied than to reveal to your opponent that they were playing under a handicap the entire time if you do bother trying these methods out just gives your more skilled player at your locals or whatever uh I'm not responsible for any amount of ass-kicking that you may or may not receive after doing it all right let's go so number five surprise buttsecks by little d little d it was a monster own monster from the left that was released in Joey's world's legendary collection and it's a dinosaur level 3 with 1,100 attack I believe I'm not too sure you can check like the car right here if you're having a top decking battle and say you talk back a little d an attack for game that's the surprise buttsecks right there what's actually kind of funny about this method was this was actually not my idea I actually saw this one being performed at a regional Seattle regional the guy was playing necross he put three little deed in his deck just to troll with people just to make people very pissed off and well he was quite successful except not at the event obviously he has three freaking bed cards in his entire deck that didn't synergize with anything although he could use it for a tribute so that's kind of good number four there's one god card that none of us like losing to and it's not obelisk obelisk is pretty old p probably australia's god card in the game probably considering he has more protection effects who compared to most that's not the guy god I'm talking about the guy thought I'm talking about needed another support god card to make it a little more worth playing you know what I'm talking about I'm talking about the winged dragon Oh by playing winged dragon of raw you're literally saying I can give up my next turn because all you have to do is cowboyed me for game and you'll win but no you're not going to get that chance cuz winged dragon Ron's gonna beat your ass back to the Stone Age this was actually a challenge at my locals guys at MSD TV often have random challenges at our locals like play a retro decker rather than your usual tier one one of the challenges the god card challenge the three of us have to take one random god card out of the pile and I apparently got winged dragon Iran and one of our goals was against each other we had to summon the god card to kill to attack for match if it's not format you cannot attack for game number three Exodia no I'm not talking about using exodia's effect in your hand to get the alternative wind condition I'm actually talking about kicking your opponent's ass with pieces of Exodia whether you can bitch-slap them if you're right-handed you have use the right arm of Exodia if you're left-handed you have to use the left arm of Exodia bonus points to you if you can get the full x odia beatdown summon every piece of Exodia start and then kick his ass with each piece and then finish him off with a headbutt Zidane would be proud number two guess what your opponent got for Christmas this year a game loss I'm not talking about rule shocking rule shocking is totally bad and that's a different figure all entirely but what does Christmas have to do with anything for that matter well you're going to give them a Santa Claus and watching deco especially for decks like chicken race I don't know most liked and you're not gonna pull off a chicken race but mill decks and fur noise lights warns you you name it watch your palms face become very salty as soon as they realize they decked out on your turn because of a card that potentially was supposed to give him a plus-one number one and finally my favorite way to be my opponent is to grade their performance there's only five cards again think of that has letters on it and that's destiny board and the rest of the spirit messages of course destiny board is the F so you kind of don't need to run the rest of them but bonus points if you spell the word fail and dispel fail you have to spell n fail or fail it whichever one whichever way you prefer by getting the entire thing out you probably could have won already but it's practically impossible and it blows up on you half the time the other way to use destiny board is to give them their letter grade literally use exchange but you fail if you give the letter A to them rather than your f well that's my top 5 ways to BM your opponent I mean it's pretty easy if I someone just scoop if they the seeds is kind of it's got crap to them if you got any other terrible ways to make your opponent feel bad wow only using cards don't tell them they're filthy scrub it let's really me well what I'm doing is pretty neat too but you get the idea to build in the game leave that in the comments section down below and of course I would like to thank team ApS for letting me post in this video I'm normally a pretty nice guy I don't begin my opponent at all you know what they say if you're always a nice guy deep down you got some pretty dark thoughts happening I guess this was mine of course you guys please check out someone to MST TVs video see here we have we do dual videos we do sketches of course you guys may have already seen a few of our videos already but uh you can subscribe to us if you want and don't forget to subscribe to team a PS if you haven't already and they'll be posting a video on our channel soon so you have to check that out too and don't

        "transcript": "all right what's going on guys my name is Nick and this is surprise surprise a Call of Duty Black Ops gameplay commentary a domination game on the map wmd but I'm just using the game play as footage for a backdrop of what I want to talk about that seems to be the trend these days in this community no one really talks about the gameplay anymore but anyways uh like I said I'm just going to go over some topics that a lot of you guys are either messaging me about or leaving comments in the recent videos I've been posting um first thing I want to talk about is my PC build uh a couple weeks ago I posted a video on me buying parts to build a PC and a lot of you guys were wondering uh when's part two going to come out when I'm I'm going to actually Finish the build and to answer your question I will finish the build as soon as I get enough money to as of right now I just don't have uh the funds to continue building it uh the only reason I posted that video is because they were just having a crazy sale that day on computer parts and I actually had just enough money to buy what I needed so like I said once I get more funds I will buy some more of the components and then eventually we'll get to a point where I will actually build the videos and yeah that is the reason for that and the next is videos uh videos videos videos uh a lot of you guys are wondering what I'm going to be doing next uh considering I just finished up Catherine uh which was was a pretty successful let's play a lot of you guys seem to like that it brought a lot of new subscribers to the channel which is pretty cool uh so if you're new uh welcome and this is actually going to be a well-edited video it's going to have Chopper camera and puppy vision and all that kind of stuff so uh a little bit extra a little bit of extra effort in this video opposed to what you would normally see but anyways like I was saying uh future videos so um I don't know if all you saw it but a couple months ago I posted videos from Miss 2o and I posted on the last video that if the video or the finale got 1,000 likes I would do an evil playthrough and as of right now there a bunch there about 10 messages in my inbox inbox um messaging me letting me know that the video hit a th and that I should be doing the video soon or the evil let's play soon and yes I will be doing it um as of right now though I'm just still playing Catherine actually um where I was in that game uh I couldn't get all the endings so I actually had to replay it and if you guys know anything about me at all if I find that there's a good game that I like then what I do is I try to at least Platinum it and platinuming that game requires me to beat all the stages on hard and there's actually a trick to it if you want to get all the endings if you get up to day six with neutral Karma with the meter right in the middle um you can actually and you have gold trophies for all the stages for whatever play through you on either normal or hard or easy uh at chapter 6 you can actually just skip all the skip all the platforming components all the puzzle components and you have enough opportunity to either build your karma gauge to the left or to the right and based on all that so I can actually get all the endings so that's taking me a while so uh for the next couple days I'm going to be working on that getting all the gold trophies on hard uh because that in itself is a gold trophy uh for PlayStation Network that is so I'm going to be doing that and after I'm done all that um cuz a lot of you guys actually want to see more of the endings like I said after I'm done that then I'm going to be uh posting the game play from Infamous 2 as well another play through hit a milestone a lot of you guys are also messaging me for Sly Cooper 2 because I promise you guys the slly Cooper uh to play through if the finale of that video got 300 likes and that has also done so and you guys once again have also been messaging me reminding me that uh I need to do that because that's what I promise you guys and yeah I plan to live up to all my promises uh so as of right now like I said what I do is what I plan to do is finish up Catherine post all the endings for that game for you guys to watch I also plan to finish up heavy rain and once Heavy Rain is finished then I'm going to start the infamous to uh evil walk through and then after that's done then I will do the slide to to uh walk through so that is the uh schedule for events for the next coming weeks and as well by the I plan to by the time the Sly Cooper series is over thex Human Revolution will be out and I will be doing a complete let's play of that as well so uh for you guys wondering what what's going to be coming uh up in terms of new video games uh that's what I have planned DSX is coming out and I do plan to do a let's play on that so uh things that those are just some things that you can kind of look forward to in the near future with the channel and if you're a little bit anxious or curious of future videos I will be doing in the later part of this year in Q4 or the fourth quarter a complete list to guaranteed Let's Plays that I will be doing is actually listed in my channel as well as the release dates for those games and as well if you wanted to see some of my older stuff just in case if you are a new subscriber uh there's a complete list of completed or ongoing series that I have done uh just in case you guys are getting a little bit bored I don't know if you are just because I just completed cath a couple days ago and probably not all you guys have watched all the videos yet I don't know but anyways and as well we are actually fast approaching 20,000 subscribers which is very very crazy um according to my YouTube Insight it'll be like a month before uh we actually reach there and like I said that's absolutely nuts I started my channel just over a year ago and I set the goal to have 10,000 subscribers and I just reached that several months ago and to know the fact that I just I'm about to hit almost double that is absolutely insane and very humbling and I have nothing but thanks for you guys for all the support and love that you give to your Channel all the comments you leave you guys leaving like ratings for the videos and I love reading the comments in the comment boxes from you guys I sometimes release videos early just because uh for Let's Plays just because I I want to go to bed reading the comments and I like I said can't thank you guys enough and for 20,000 subscribers I will actually be doing a giveaway uh don't worry you won't have to do anything such as like or favor the video or anything like that um I will just be doing a 20K video and I'll do some sort of a contest or competition really really quick one that is or I'll just ask you guys a question and you guys can respond to it and uh I'll just choose a random winner and that winner will be able to uh pick a game that they want either it's going to be released uh in the future or has released it really doesn't matter and then they'll choose a game I'll buy it for them and then I'll just mail it for them and that will basically be it a free game for some for one of you guys that have been loyal to the channel and it's just like it's just really a really small I'm just saying this a small token of my thanks to you guys like I don't think there's anything I could possibly do uh to truly be 100% represent do something that's 100% representative of my thanks to you guys but anyways like I said uh the gameplay comes soon up end here um as always thank you guys for all the support thank you for the all the love if you want to know all the stuff that I'm doing in the future check out my channel and that is pretty much it I'll talk to you guys later have a fantastic day"

        "transcript": "I'll be close to you so can you just introduce yourselves who goes first whoever wants to I'm angr de Martinez and I'm Fred the Martinez hello can you tell me about your wild boar operation we have been raising wild boar since about 1992 is when we got started with the bores um the whole idea behind it was to do something different um and it certainly is very different took years to establish it uh to know how to Market it and and know how to grow them what to feed them that took years and so with wild boore you already you grow pigs yes so what's the difference in raising pigs and raising wild boore pigs is a totally hands on thing wild boar is a totally hands off thing oh really and you find out the Heart Way is when you're trying to when I try to catch them at first there was uh I thought that I could handle them like pigs so you kind of heard him along yeah and I quickly found out that that's not the way to do it what happened was there's one wild boar was standing right in front of me and at at in a split second he was looking straight at me and he went right over top of me he just jumped from standing still and I'm 6'4 he jumped right over top of me and he was took 2 years to catch him really he was gone for two years on the on the but it took two years to actually catch him for markets yeah to get him back in that smaller area where you you can then get him onto our livestock trailer and that took two years I had to build something totally different to trick him to get into it just smart now with wallboard that is possible because uh you don't just ship them when they're um when they're very young because it takes a lot longer to grow them so two and a half years is nothing for them to uh to bring it up to Market weight and then for a pig what is it under for pigs right now it's about 6 months from the day they're born they're 250 PBS and then you've got maybe a one or two week window to sell the animal otherwise it gets to be too big but because the wild Bo are such slow Growers you've got a year to market the animal uh if you grow them the way we do which is out in pastures out in the bush year round outside with some shelters now because since 1992 the weather has changed we we never we used to get Frost in the beginning of November and snow and it would stay nowaday it rains until Christmas and the muds harded on animals because then they're stand they're wet so we have to we have to provide some some shelters for them yeah yeah that's but they have free access to the outside at all times they I love the winter it's it's great how how big is the herd do you call them a herd yeah yeah yeah big is the herd right now we have somewhere around between about 150 to 200 animals yeah so um ingred have you had any run-ins with a wild boar not too much so you stay away on the other side of the fence it's uh I usually I used to help Fred catch the pigs so it was um it was a long process and it uh you know you had to have lots of patience but you get kind of good at it so so when you're catching them is it like hurting no you don't do it's all hands off wbore is only hands off so you got to trick them you have to trick them Tri them to go where you want them to go yep okay Y and you get them into a smaller area and then you get them into a smaller area again and by then you've got them in an area that's covered with with steel mesh so they still think that they can jump out but then you've got them under control cuz now they can't jump out anymore and then they can they go on to a trailer to a lestock trailer and then you bring them to the Avatar they're still a wild animal I mean they will attack if they're you know if they think they're the Cod or then they will attack and they have tusks so how big are the tusks you see about 1/3 right 1/3 you see and 2/3 is embedded so how far out from your face would it come like an inch and a half it depends on age okay like the breeding boar if he's 5 years old he'll have tusks that are 2 and 1 half Ines long if they didn't break in the meantime cuz they use them all the time and they keep growing back so if one would break off then in about a year he'll have a new one again cuz they use the tusks to rip up roots and to break roots and to be able to get into the soil but the nice part with bors is that they don't ruin the land because once they get to the sub sooil they stop they don't go down into the subsoil they don't mix that with the top soil so if you've got 6 in of top soil they they'll go down 6 in if you got 2 fet of top soil they'll make a huge hole 2 feet deep wow but then they'll stop huh so yeah it's interesting yeah well thanks for talking to me my my arm is going to break so I'm going to say goodby thank you very much you're welcome"

        "transcript": "how's it going to name my friends always I hope you all having yourselves a fantastic day my [\u00a0__\u00a0] cat is like howling in the background what are you doing ha ha ha he's like a 1 and all [\u00a0__\u00a0] welcome for [\u00a0__\u00a0] sake I can't get out of this stupid spawn like always oh my god I can't do anything like I honestly cannot get a break I don't know what just kicked into me there but okay cuz I'll take an orbital visa I do not know about you guys but I'm very curious about this do you prefer to go to bed later or do you prefer to wake up early because I prefer to go bed somewhere like 10:00 to 12:00 somewhere in between those two hour range don't like going to bed any later than that because I like to spend my time in the morning being productive making videos streaming and such maybe even doing chores if they need to be done I don't want to spend most of my day in the bed cuz when you stay up extremely late you're most likely gonna sleep in for most of the day I like waking up earlier I like 7:00 getting a whole bunch of [\u00a0__\u00a0] done I definitely want to know what you guys prefer staying up late or waking up early in the morning let me know down in the comments I definitely prefer the energetic feeling that I feel in the mornings rather than the groggy sleepy feeling I feel at like 3 or 4 a.m. because I did used to stay up extremely late every night and sleep in and that just did not feel good especially not when I woke up oh my god my body just did not want to do anything it's not a good feeling so that's why I do think a lot of people side with me on the whole waking up early but I feel like a whole bunch of people still do stay up late just out of not wanting the next day to come I I enjoy the next day I'm always looking forward to the next day because I got another video to make and maybe another stream to stream another day with my girlfriend you know I got a lot of stuff to be thankful for so I'm always happy for the days well there's a lot of people who just hate the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of school and stuff like that so they just stay up late watching Netflix just playing with their friends cuz it's fun you know there's nothing wrong with that I used to the same thing I'm sure there are tons you out there just wish you didn't even have to sleep imagine not having to spend those 8 to 10 up to 12 hours just sleepy and tired imagine if you've had that energy all day every day like how productive you could be at the night in the night oh man I would love for that to happen but you know that's why I like to wake up early because then I have that energy feeling off that's why I like to wait ah that's why I like to wake up early because now I have that energy feeling throughout the entire day rather than just for like 30 seconds of it or whatever you go to sleep extremely late it's just nothing compared to when you go to bed early and get a good night's sleep in my opinion because when I wake up early and start getting stuff done I just feel so much better even when I'm about to go to bed I still have energy still do things throughout the entire day no matter how tired I am I still can do things I don't know how to explain it I can even though I kind of did but if you want my advice the best thing to do if you really love gaming is to have another hobby with it so that you're not just interested in gaming all the time so you're only intentions aren't just trying to play xbox so you actually want to do something else sometimes you know so there's not only one thing on your mind see for me I have soccer or football I know there's English people they're gonna get mad if I try to call them soccer I feel trapped inside a house sometimes because you're just inside it's not like being outside when you take a breath of fresh air to breath a fresh [\u00a0__\u00a0] air feels good like me I'm trying to go the fields at least once a week if not twice as soon as I get my Colorado license that'll probably be almost every day because as much as I love videogames I'm just as passionate about soccer I'm just here to call it soccer because every time I say soccer there's no [\u00a0__\u00a0] way I'm gonna say or football like come on people could call it soccer sometimes it honestly feels like the people watching my videos are like my [\u00a0__\u00a0] therapists like honestly youtubers vent a lot in their videos they rant and they occasionally get some stuff off their chest what do you do to a therapist do you do all that you talk about your [\u00a0__\u00a0] you talk about what's going on exactly what we're doing except we don't have to pay you guys an extremely large amount of money I like you guys you're good therapist I am going to do the stupidest thing in the world are now basically want to put a virtual bounty on my own head if you hit a cross map tomahawk or insane trickshot on me while in my lobby I'm gonna add you not necessarily like on somebody else but if you hit me you'll get to be on my friends list I don't know why that's such a big deal with people but there are the occasional people that I can remove occasionally add a fan so if you [\u00a0__\u00a0] bill me you if you do that you son of a [\u00a0__\u00a0] I will add you as much as I hate getting trickshot 'add if it's nice I'll do that for you sometimes I'm in a lobby for up to an hour at some points and I'll be talking to like a certain couple of people that are fans that you know enjoy my presence and I enjoy this they're talking to me and they end up hitting like a trickshot or something like that I was like hey hey man I was a new friend requests like ah thank you to flee did you hit again this trail kids just [\u00a0__\u00a0] so oh we hit the [\u00a0__\u00a0] ladder stall okay yeah okay dude dude that was sick I was honestly sick that was some good [\u00a0__\u00a0] they trail just because you were such a nice guy and can't you hit some clip I'm gonna send you friend requests yeah have a good night dude you'll probably be in tomorrow's video no doubt thank y'all so much for watching today's video you know all you have to do to make my day is leave a thumbs up if you enjoy as always my friends I do hope you all have yourselves a fantastic day a fail man and a goodbye"

        "transcript": "hey guys jared here from doing airsoft and polly here we're doing an airsoft review of polly's jg m5 s5 it's just an mp5 sd5 with a full stock that's like the sd5 model not the st6 with a classic stock but anyway we're going to before we get on to this review please say the pros and cons about this gun alright the first con i have about this gun is this gun is ambidextrous but when i when i was playing the other side fell off so thank god i'm not a lefty uh i'm ready so that's a good thing uh a pro thing a pro about this gun is that it's light it's very light you can move around with it very well uh a con is that i don't know if you can see it but on the grip if it gets scratched it the it's like plastic covered by rubberized stuff to make comfortable and the rubberized stuff rubs away after a while and like that's why i have duct tape on it but i don't have it on for this video but that's a con and the battery is very big i don't like the battery at all it like adds a lot more weight to the gun and yeah that's basically it about the pros and cons of the gun i have all right so now let's get on to it now we're going to work ours work from the back of the stock to the front and this is all plastic to stop but has a rubberized butt plate which you can pull down and it will review your large type connector which is a large type on the battery and you see how big the battery is to the stock it's like a brick battery it's huge so you can put a 9 6 big battery thing a large type battery in here so that's a good thing but you're going to have to get a large type connector because it doesn't use the small to make connectors which most of your people are used to but use 15 1500 million battery and it's 8.4 volt battery so now let's go to the body of the gun all right now with the body of the gun it's all abs plastic right here this is the lower part is abs plastic uh there's a metal trigger a plastic trigger guard that feels more like a palmer i think but the real version of the gun is not metal so you know that this is not going to probably be metal but here's just uh top receivers plastic too with some metal sights right here reversible you can move them around yeah there's multiple sites um and also you can put your magazine in through here with the american lease magazine release right here and it holds 200 rounds this magazine metal it's a metal bag yep and that's all in with this the uh the fire swatch switch gets loose after a while and it fell off on the other side as paulie said in the beginning of the video so now let's go on today guys now with the barrel of the gun the suppressor on it is uh it's abs plastic and you can't remove it because it's attached to the gun and you can't just twist it off and uh orange tip you're gonna have to do some work to get off like you just can't tweak you can't just like twist it off like on some aeg's and with the hand guard right here it's very comfortable with the rubberized feel to it but it would get like sometimes it'll just like kind of like shed kind of like it'll get scratched up and probably did put some hockey tape over it but he took it off for a second to review and also like the metal sights and metal sling right here and also you got the hk slap but it doesn't work on the other side so that's a bit of confirmation it don't really matter the hop-up system is right here you can see this little switch get to zoom on it pop up right here yeah see like when you pull this back nothing happens on the other side it's just something to play around with yeah so now let's go to the final conclusion all right now for the final conclusion i got this gun at airsoft megastore for around 110 dollars plus shipping obviously i got this gun around june so i can't guarantee that the price is the same uh i got it on sale this gun is very accurate uh we had a war today and i got multiple kills uh if you saw the chrono for this it's around 300 fps it should be around 330 so it's a cqb weapon so if you want to go take this indoor airsoft field this would be good uh i recommend this to not beginner airsofters but also intermediate airsofters because this gun is very mobile and it's good it's got good rate of fire um i prefer this uh the sd5 instead of sd6 because of the full stock version it gives me more room for my the big brick battery and uh uh jared's got one more thing to say before we end this video so i'm gonna turn it over to you all right well i only have one more thing to say uh this has been paulie's gun we're gonna be moving on to uh more guns from happy trigger airsoft because they just came here and next gun we're going to be reviewing is nikki's aug so stay tuned to that and that's all i have to say and thank you guys for watching this review and please subscribe"

        "transcript": "so Apple just had their keynote and the iPhone 6 was just announced in this video I will be talking about my favorite five new features of the iPhone 6 and also the 6 Plus so I'm going to try to make this video as short and simple as possible so let's go ahead and get started as we all expected the iPhone 6 will come in two different screen sizes the iPhone 6 will be a 4.7 in device and the iPhone 6 Plus will be a 5.5 in device so the glass on the front curves around the edge and apple calls this new resolution retina HD the iPhone 6 has a 1334 by 750 resolution screen it's 326 pixels per inch and the iPhone 6 plus with a larger display comes in at 1080p which is full HD both our IPS displays and they improved the color reproduction the contrast and the overall saturation unfortunately the iPhone 6 does not feature sapphire glass display and by the way with a larger iPhone size the power button is now on the side so it's much easier to press you don't have to reach to the top to press the power button the iPhone 6 is also the thinnest iPhone yet coming in at 6.9 mm and the iPhone 6 Plus is 7.1 mm so they're all thinner than the iPhone 5s inside the iPhone 6 it has a new processor it's the A8 processor which Apple claims is 25% faster than the A7 processor and this has a 50% faster Graphics chip this also has a second generation 64-bit processor and compared to the original iPhone this processor is rated to be 50 times faster and for the graphics it's 84 times faster Apple also says the A8 processor is 50% more power efficient so it stays cool and doesn't overheat often apple is also introducing a new motion C- processor the M8 the motion processor sits alongside the A8 which measures movement elevation and steps so this can be very useful for Fitness application because this can measure uh your elevation so when you climb a mountain or climb steps it can measure your movement the iPhone 6 and the 6 Plus also has a much improved battery so here's a chart comparing the battery life on the 6 plus the 6 and the 5S so you can see that the new iPhones does have a much improved battery life especially the 6 plus this also has a new eyesight camera with a new sensor the sensor is still 8 megapixels but this has a lot of new features the iPhone 6 will have Digital Image stabilization but the iPhone 6 Plus will have Optical stabilization the camera lens on the 6 Plus actually has motion so this can reduce blurry shots especially in low light situations this also has a new feature called Focus pixel in the camera which basically allows the phone to use face detection autofocus which is similar to something that you would find in the DSLR and the autofocus can be up to two times faster than the last generation iPhone the slow motion feature has also improved from 120 frames per second to 24 frames per second so you can capture even slower motion with the iPhone 6 there are also many new camera features on iOS 8 such as the time-lapse feature there's also continuous autofocus while shooting video with the new eyesight sensor so you can pre-order this on September 12th and it's going on sale on September 19th the price starts at $199 for the 16 GB version of the iPhone 6 and $299 for the iPhone 6 plus the storage goes from 16 to 64 and 128 GB the phone will be available in three different colors the same as the iPhone 5S gold silver and space gray so these were my favorite features of the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 plus if you enjoy this video don't forget to give it a thumbs up and also share this video on your social networks so more people can watch this video and know more information about the new iPhone 6 thanks a lot for watching don't forget to follow me on Twitter Instagram and go+ I'm very active on these three social networks links will be in the video description thanks a lot for watching and I'll see you in my next [Music] video"

        "transcript": "[Music] yo guys what's up it's tbot here and today we're going to be doing a red alert troll base now this is a base that I used in my clan war and we're going to see how well people do against this base I've been using it for around a few weeks or a month or so and this guy has pretty lowl Heroes he has lowl troops as well he's going to trigger some traps in the center of the base just testing out for traps and obviously have some giant bombs and Teslas and I tried to spread out my cannons and Archer Towers along the outside of this base as well he's going to drop a Golem on the right hand side it looks like he's going to do a go wipe attack and obviously he's going to get wrecked so you can see all the Wizards and witches are going to come out of my clan castle and they're just going to head towards his troops he has plenty of time to make a move but up to now he's just been testing out for traps and looking around the base where he should attack he's going to drop another Golem on the right hand side along with some more Wizards to take out my clan castle that worked out out cuz they were all bunched up but I still have my witches that are spawning in skeletons he's got 3% he's going to break through that one wall he's going to drop a jump spell maybe a little bit too early going to drop his golems in the center pekkas as well they look like they're level three pekas they're going to go straight to the core and I have just so many defenses Inferno Towers um just working on those Heroes right now they're going to get taken out in just a little bit Archer Queen goes down level nine king is going to go in the rage ability not going to do too much damage there and that was a pretty easy um defensive win you can see how many rage spells are just layered on top of each other definitely didn't help out for him and keep in mind that I was the number one base in this clan war and this guy must have been like number 30 or something like that but these Golems are going to hit against that one wall and uh the XO is going to shoot down these golems and it looks like it's just the end of the raid so that was a pretty funny raid um he definitely did not get any single star obviously this guy was a little bit un experien with troll bases let's get on to the next one and he's the number one player attacking me he's going to do a go a attack strategy from the leftand side here break through one compartment it looks like and drop a few Wizards we're going to have to see if he breaks through a multiple compartments and he's going to drop a few more wall breakers I don't see the point in that because the whole compartment is just one area and he's going to go in from the right hand side as well with three Golems so he's using around four or five Golems he has level 40 King Queen and he's going to go around the base here this base is sort of uh designed to have the heroes and all the troops just swing around the base and not head towards the middle he's going to use a rage spell maybe a little bit prematurely something I really like about this base is that The Inferno Towers from the core can stretch out to those Heroes and the attacking troops that are just around the core some Hog Riders going to be deployed on the right hand side there his heroes are still alive and it looks like that Archer Queen is going to be on that dark elixir storage it's okay cuz none of those resources are actually going to be taken from me uh the Wizards are going to be deployed on the left hand side going to be taken out by my clan castle troops as well 42% it looks like he's going to get that one star but not the two star Golems are still alive he's going to drop a few Wizards on the right hand side he still has a free spell that Archer Queen is going to be distracted by that Dragon she has a few Wizards to help her out still 40 seconds left in this raid they just got that one star 51% overall this base has been working very very well well especially in clan war raids the Archer Queen is going to head towards the core of the base and she's going to be distracted by the storage but soon she's going to go towards that Inferno Tower The Inferno Tower is doing so much work right now and the queen is at such low Health it looks like she's going to go down uh with the help of that Expo she's going to Target the town hall but she doesn't have enough strength so 66% 15 seconds left he's not going to be able to get that two star and it looks like this base has definitely been working for that one star so just a few troops remaining here wizard is still alive and it's going to get taken out very very soon by that level 13 Cannon the very new one and 70% final percentage let's get right into the next raid and this is the number two attacker going to be attacking me as well level 40 king and queen lots of level 40 King and Queens I have a level 21 king and a level 23 Queen so you can see um just the range in which that these attackers are attacking me and I'm just I just shouldn't be their prime target right now and they shouldn't be failing against me so he's going to put his King in the rage ability something he really really messed up on in this raid is that he launched his king and queen first I have no idea why he did that uh usually you want to do that for a dragon attack just to clear a path but there's no reason to clear a path right now he's going to get 20% just from the king and queen going to drop a few balloons on the left and right hand side obviously doing a Laval loonan attack he still has five balloons two wall breakers two archers and one barbarian so those wall breakers aren't going to be very helpful he's going to drop a rage spell right in the center core free spell on the left hand side as well and that Inferno Tower is going to be doing so much damage especially since it's multi-target 38% 41 and it looks like there's going to be a one star with all of these lava pops just littering the entire map here some of these balloons are heading off to the right hand side he's got that 46% about to get that one star so this is definitely looking very clutch uh there is the 51% he might be able to get that town hall I don't know if there just a few balloons off to the right there but the lava pops are definitely in mass quantities they're going to definitely pick off as much percentage as possible since there are no defense is reaching those lava pups until they head towards that Inferno Tower and Expo that balloon is to be trailing behind that lava hound and the Lava Hound sure takes a lot of damage so we're going to see if those troops head towards the middle especially my four Teslas just guarding that town hall the love hounds don't stand a chance something I wanted to mention in the beginning of the video but I didn't get the chance for is The Clash of Clans builder tool and that's a great tool where you can make your own bases put it on your Clash of Clans account and just strategize very well I have a video on it it'll be in the description right now and on the screen so go check it out definitely a very good website anyways let's get on with the raid we're currently at 91% still that one star he has 40 seconds left his minions are just doing work on that gold storage EXC me that Elixir Storage then they're going to head over to the town hall and they're going to get taken out by that level three Inferno Tower uh just some archers helping out those minions it looks like he dropped them just now and this is going to be the end of the video so I hope you guys enjoyed tell me what you guys think in the comments section down below if you guys want free jumps the first link down in the description and I'll see you guys in the next one peace I spit his gold like I got a grill bet you people talking thought I'd sell out once I got a deal still me on my team only difference we live in the Hills we live in the"

        "transcript": "all right in this video I'm going to do an example of finding the center and radius of a circle and what we're going to do is we're going to take an equation that's going to represent a circle it's going to be all M multiplied out and what we're going to do is we're going to complete the square so that we can put it in a more recognizable form um I'm definitely not going to you know I'm going to go through the completing the square process a little bit faster um just because I'm assuming at this point you've seen completing the square if not there's certainly other videos out there floating around that really break you know where I break down completing the square into a little more detail but okay so the basic idea is so we have x^2 + 16x again when I look at the X terms what I want is I I want to factor out um any coefficient on the X squ well here the coefficient on the x s is just a positive one so I can basically just stick the x^2 + 16x in parentheses I can do the same thing with the y^2 - 14 Y and what I like to do is if there's a constant floating around like here we have the -200 I just add it to the right side so in this case we'll get positive 200 and now it's kind of the uh this the completing the square step so what I do is I look at my number the coefficient um in front of the X and in this case it's a 16 what we do is we take one half of that number so 1 12 of 16 is going to give us positive 8 we take that number positive 8 and we Square it and that gives us positive 64 so what I'm going to do kind of uh just you know out of the blue here I'm going to introduce a positive 64 to the left side of the equation so again here positive 64 is kind of a new number that I'm adding in there that wasn't there before likewise I'm going to do the same thing for the uh the Y's so I've got y^2 - 14 y I'm going to add some new number in there and the trick is again I take 1/2 of the number this time in front of Y so that would give me -7 and then again we take that number and we Square it and in this case that's going to give me positive 49 Okay so we've really added a positive 49 um out of nowhere again if you were to imagine Distributing to if you imagine getting rid of the parentheses you know everything would be the same as in the original problem except again this positive 64 and that's positive 49 that I've added to the left side so to keep everything balanced what I'm going to have to do is I'm going to have to add 64 to the right side and I'm also going to have to add a positive 4 9 to the right side okay so the whole point of doing this is now each set of parentheses so this x^2 + 16 x + 64 this factors as x + 8 * x + 8 which I'm just going to write as x + 8 squared likewise this y^2 - 14 y + 49 that's going to factor as y - 7 and Y - 7 notice again when we took 1/2 of the number we got eight and that's what we used to factor we took 1/2 of the -14 we got -7 that's how it factors just as a little you know thing to notice so we'll have y - 7^ 2 and then on the right side let's see if we do 2 64 and 49 so what is that 64 and 49 so that's 3 and 113 and if we add 200 it looks like we get 313 I believe if my there is correct um so what it says is we can now read the center we've now put this in our center radius form and remember to get the center whatever number is with the X we actually take kind of the opposite sign so the center will be at the x coordinate of8 we do the same thing with the y-coordinate so here the center it'll be centered at the y-coordinate of positive 7 and the radius it's not just whatever the number is remember we actually have to take the square root of that number 313 so um at this point you can try to break this down and simplify it or maybe plug it into a calculator um for all I know it could be prime off the top of my head I'm not sure so I'll leave that as a little bit of of an exercise to you all"

        "transcript": "this is the updated 2014 2015 volton Eli 500 it's a value-priced electric bike and one that's really well balanced and just I think pretty thoughtfully configured uh when you think about the accessories and the layout even the look like it's a good-looking bike uh let me just jump in to the bicycle aspects of this starting with these awesome black welgo pedals see how they're just they're wide and they've got these Nice metal grips on them and reflectors I love these pedals I'm glad they used them and then check that out aluminum sort of a bash guard right so that keeps the teeth on your front chain ring um from you know hitting rocks or something if you're riding Offroad and this is sort of a trail bike um you know hard tail you could say mountain bike and it feels solid like I've taken this thing Offroad the suspension works pretty well it's got a lockout you know it's Sr Sun tour here it's it's not like the top top of the line but it does a pretty good job and again for being one of the more affordable type of bikes like this is electric bike uh these are tekro 160 mm disc brakes mechanical right and they use these tekro brake levers they're sort of topof the line I've seen a bunch of different versions out there these ones have like the rubber they cut power to the motor and they've even got this like little bell just really integrated well so you don't have a bunch of clutter here in in sort of like the cockpit area I like that and then you got trigger shifters which is great cuz if you're mountain biking you want you know twist shifters just they don't make as much sense even a Twist throttle but you know I'm glad it has one here this has twist throttle as well as pedal assist so I'll get into that in a second we got a rear fender it actually has a rear light as well but it's just battery powered it's just kind of like a basic accessory the front light however is actually wired in and fairly adjustable you can aim it it's connected right to the fork so it's not on a fender it's not going to be bouncing around or anything and they've got it set up so it can just it like basically you plug it in here this is the same port that you plug the whole bike in to charge it or you can take the battery out and charge it separately so that's one of the cool things about this bike and some others you can take the battery off and that's perfect for if you're transporting this like on your car using a car Rack or whatever cuz it makes the bike lighter easier to lift of course if you store the battery inside with like neutral temperatures it's going to last longer that's just the right way to do it but it's really well concealed I mean this could pass for just like a bicycle but it's actually a very powerful bicycle this is a 500 W geared rear hub motor and it's man the system so 500 W geared rear hob motor 48volt 11 a hour Samsung lithium magnes Cobalt battery this is super powerful it's like one of the most powerful uh Hub Hub gear weird bikes that I've actually had had a chance to ride it goes super fast tons of torque climbs well just a blast to ride um and before I forget to mention it they've got this Frame set up in addition to the fenders and there is a front one that's just sort of taken off cuz we're going to take it Offroad today um it's also got these braz on for adding a rack right so pretty sweet you could configure this for the city you could take it Offroad again the fork has lockout so it's just a lot of good options that's what earlier like thoughtfully configured um gosh what am I am I forgetting here I don't want to forget anything like I don't know I just I like the way it looks oh my complaint no water bottle brazon like you know I don't know they might add some here in the future and it could like you could put your bottle on but you know you do get thirsty you can always use a camel back or maybe if you have that rack you could put a a saddle bag with like a bottle holder or something like that that's like one of my few complaints on this bike um volon they've been around since like 2010 they have a one-ear warranty pretty solid and this bike comes in a couple different colors there's like white silver or black like we see here and it also comes in a step through design which is pretty pretty sweet it's going to be like a little bit of a shorter frame easier to mount like if you're just someone who's not as tall um that that would be ideal and it comes in sort of like a dark red or white so that's that's kind of it and I I also wanted to highlight like their new battery cover it's got this nice rubber piece like lip and the battery inside is in like a canvas bag it's really nice it's just it's a good setup they've been refining and tweaking things for a while on this and um yeah it just it fits together really nice I think they started out with a pretty good product too and so now it's just like you know dialing it in so here is the display console when you get this bike basically put the battery in and and then you can turn it on by holding the mode button and there are five levels of pedal assist and what's cool is in zero you can just go throttle mode so you don't need to like be in pedal assist and then have that moment where you forget and you pedal and you're like oh and it you know so anyway that's like a minor gripe but uh something I appreciate check this out like you just you're on it I'm in zero and it just it flies right we're just like instantly taking off I'm going to show you the motor there we go no problem no pedaling we were like up to 20 mph there climbing a little incline which is nice um now I'm going to do just pedal assist it's got like a kind of a basic like six sensor magnet so it senses when when you pedal and it just goes on anytime your feet are moving it goes um which which is like a positive and a negative like it's a little less responsive when you stop so I'm going to show that real quick so you can see how the bike keeps going even though I've stopped pedaling but at the same time I don't need to really like overexert myself to activate the motor so it's a trade-off um compared with something like torque sensing assist or something where it's like speed torque and Cadence this is more basic but you know this is that more affordable price point as well let me show the little magnetic sensor there it is yeah actually I think it's a five sensor um which is just sort of you know that's been around for several years some of the new bikes have like 12 sensor and they I don't know they could go to that at some point this doesn't work too bad and again the throttle is like instantaneous very responsive and because the brake levers are wired in anytime you pull that the motor will will cut out so yeah not too bad it's the volton alation 500 48 volt Edition for the specs on this comments and stuff or questions I'll see you back at electricbikereview.com"

        "transcript": "hi natural beauties okay so today i am finally going to do my winter fall winter wash and go routine i've been wanting to do this for a long time but i've been kind of waiting because i've been playing around with what's working best for my hair because i've had to use different products in a different routine during the fall and winter months than i did during the summer so as you can see i just got out the shower from co-washing my hair so what i do is i get in the shower and i use the tresemme naturals flawless curl let me it's not trust me naturals this tresemme flawless curls curls hydration absolutely love this one it's not completely curly girl friendly or curly girl method friendly but i found that this one just works better for my fall winter hair and you got to do what works best for you so i use this first and all i do is i kind of saturate my hair with it i massage it in there and then i put a hair tie on my hair and i do my other business or whatever so i do like a mini deep conditioning treatment then i come back and i rinse it all out and then i'll take another handful and just put it in my hair or whatever and then get out the shower so i leave some in and while it's in there when i first started washing it or whatever i detangle that's when i do my detangling with my fingers alright so now we're at the part where i just got the shower a few minutes ago and i put a t-shirt on my head and now i'm going to show you what i do this is my wet hair so the first thing that i do is that i've been using the jojoba oil for my fall and winter i usually use coconut oil but it's really good to change it up sometimes so this has been working great for me i'm just going to put a little bit and i'm just going to put it on my edges because my edges get really dry and then i'm going to um put a little bit more in you don't need much and i really want to kind of get it right here so that i can really kind of get it in my scalp good all right next i am going to use the curl and style milk by shea moisture i love this one and i use a lot of this and then i'm just going to do sections of it and i rake it through so this is my first section oh that's too much so i'm gonna do a larger section so i'm gonna do this whole section because i put too much in but i usually do about four sections raking it through make sure you get those ends and then i'm gonna do the back section all right now i just put a little bit more through the top a little bit on the ends and on the bottom on the back part all right next i go through with my oil to seal this in and you don't need a lot of the jojoba oil at all so i kind of do like two sections mainly focusing on my ends and i do some in the back part and then i want to focus on the crown and my hair just i didn't part it that way it just kind of did that in the shower all right so the last thing that i do is i use a gel and i didn't have to use gel during the summer and i didn't have to use as much conditioner and product during the summer but in the winter your hair changes and you have to do things differently so i have to use a gel now if i don't want it super frizzy because in the winter my hair is just super frizzy so i've been using the curls goddess curls gel and i don't need a whole lot of this and i do two section no i do about four sections i really want to focus up here because that's where it's really frizzy yet okay so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to do my part i usually do a part on the side you guys probably hear my kids in the background so i kind of do it the way i want and i just put a little bit on the top part of this to help set the way i want my hair to fall all right and that's it so i'll be back to show you guys the results all right so i'm back um it's been about two hours two and a half hours um my hair is about 90 dry it's just damp in a few areas but this is pretty much what it looks like there's a little bit of shrinkage i usually just kind of play around with the front part of it but as you guys can see this is the result no frizz and it's still really soft hope you like this one bye"

        "transcript": "originally you can see how invaluable a turntable is now here's what I'm gonna do for the sides of the cake that's special I've just I've toasted walnuts because it's always more delicious to bring out the flavor of the nut and I've chopped them either in the food processor or by hand so that I have medium fine nuts but you can see I also have lots of little particles people are always wondering why cakes and pictures look so beautiful with their nuts on them you only see big pieces of nuts and no little powdery parts that's because Baker's do this they stick with a giant colander or small calendar or a strainer coarse strainer and look at all the flour that's coming out this is called nut flour so you can see that a lot of its coming out and now I have just pure chopped nuts for the most part and now how to get them on the side of the cake hold it in your hand and then with the other hand cut the nuts and gently just let them fall against the side of the soft buttercream and they'll just adhere by themselves so now you're gonna have the wonderful crunch of walnuts because walnuts and chocolate are a synergy synergy means two ingredients that are better than either one by itself and you have both texture and flavor here you don't have to worry about coating it so that you can't see any buttercream because it's actually attractive seeing the buttercream I think for food pictures they actually put them in one at a time but we're not doing that here we're just having a nice homemade look that's all the more appealing set it down use the little angled spatula and then let it slide out and look perfect side now you can leave it like that you can use more nuts to sprinkle on the top and have the entire thing nut encrusted or you can go for broke and try piping this is wonderful buttercream to pipe you can use even one of the zip seal type of bags instead of an official paste piping bag or you can use a disposable piping bag which is terrific as you just throw it away when you're done and I'm going to cut off the bottom but I'm gonna cut it off to small so you see what happens when you do never cut just straight across because then when you open it up you have a funny little hole cut it on a curve like this so that when you drop it in it's going to be completely round and that way you won't see buttercream coming out the sides just out of the tip now you see when I put the tip through I can see the teeth are still behind so we're only gonna get the round opening I want the entire teeth to be exposed and that way we'll get a star decoration if you cut up too much it's only plastic you can stick the whole bag with the frosting in another bag and just cut off less the next time if you always use the same tube you'll know how much to cut off see no I can see the entire teeth and I like to have the open star because I get the nicest decoration they're closed stars as well in order to support the bag while I'm filling it I put it either in a tall glass or I have here a pot and if the buttercream looks like it's not smooth whisk it this looks still beautifully smooth and forming peaks you'll see as we put it in the bag and if it's too soft it won't squish instead of instead it what this is fooling in so I'm gonna hold it in my hand but you it's a very narrow bag so you'd really need to have a narrow glass to support it and if it's too soft either you can show the buttercream or you can chill your hand so the first thing to make sure is that I used my bench scraper for this but you can use the side of your hand as well make sure that all the frosting all the buttercream is down toward the front of the tube because otherwise you're in the middle of piping a beautiful design and poof the air that in the middle makes a big hole it's hard to remove once you do it and then I take it between my thumb and the rest of my finger like a pinching motion and twist it because you know what happens if you don't do it it all starts coming up so you're piping down and all of a sudden you see the top of it is coming up keep piping I do it right on my spatula to see how it's gonna come out and now I have I know I have a really nice consistency so I use a fairly large star tip because it's a large cake and the nuts are coarse and i'm chilling down my hand just for a few seconds and if I'm doing something really elaborate I keep chilling at every few decorations that lasts for a while that makes a huge difference especially if you have warm hands the easiest kind of decoration is by squeezing out a little bit of the icing then stop squeezing and lifting and you get that beautiful star decoration if you don't stop squeezing when you lift away you get a long peak that's how that happens when you wet your hand be sure and dry it because it was getting a little slippery on the bag you can do rosettes which is the same basic thing only I'm going around in a little circle stop squeezing and lift off and you can just do a few of those and stick birthday candles right in but once you get really good my favorite is the shell border that can be done just straight like a little snail or sideways like a semi rosette but the easiest way is to do the straight where you start piping and then back away gradually releasing and then lift away then start right where the tail was hold your hand steady and let the force of the bag force of the buttercream carry it forward and then we have a nice little mound like a little snail and you can see from the side that it's like a scroll and a violin do one more and then I'll show you the sideways shell that's half rosette half shell where you start off making a little rosette half rosette and then instead of going all the way around finish off with the tail then start at the end of the tail another little semi rosette keep going and you know it is just buttercream so if you mess up just take it off i steady my spatula hand always with my other hand and lift it away and they can smooth it out and the next pipe decoration will go right on top of it so you don't have to worry about this play with it it's fun but you don't want to alternate your design halfway through I'm just doing it to show stick with one or the other because it's such silky buttercream you just get the most perfect decorations and as you start using up the buttercream just keep twisting I've never unlocked my fingers because the nono of piping is to have it come up the top that's why when you use a zip seal bag it's closed so when you let kids do that you don't have to worry about it coming out anywhere but the front it will still get all over everything but not quite as much I've just showed you how to do these different decorations to see how easy it is to do but of course stick to one decoration that's a lot prettier I hope you're thoroughly convinced now that it's well worth making a syrup and doing a neoclassic buttercream to have a silky buttercream instead of the old-fashioned powdered sugar gritty wood"

        "transcript": "all right guys welcome to your first tutorial on how to make a Dennison script I'm still working on this whole talking to myself thing so bear with me um the first step is going to be downloading notepad++ it's going to be the editor you're going to want to use whenever you're doing anything with dentist grips it simplifies a lot of things um I suggested um once you get it installed you're going to go to settings preferences and then the language menu slab settings tab and check this box that says replace by space all that's going to do is cause your tab characters to become four spaces um the spaces make yml a lot happier than t characters do so just do that for your own good otherwise you'll have a bunch of scripts not loading and be banging your head against the wall um so the first thing you need to do when you're making a new script is Define its name in this case we use example script um so your next line you're going to define the type of the script in this case we're making an interact script which is your basic most common type of script um since it's part of the example script we're going to indent it to yml uses a parent child hierarchy so this is going to be a child of the example script section um so when you press tab it actually makes four little spaces which is what we just changed um like I said we need to Def find the type and in this case it's going to be an interact script um next we're going to skip the requirement section that'll be another video and we're going to get right into the steps of the script um since this is a very basic script we're only going to have one step and we'll explain more about steps in a later video but um for right now we're just going to do our one step um and the steps are going to be a child of the steps section so we're indenting again and this is going to be our first step we'll just call it one um you can do different names for for steps we could call it um you know first step or anything but um that gets into a little bit more about default steps and blah blah blah so for right now we'll name it one Dennis will know that's the the default step um so inside that step um we need to make another child section and we're going to use The Click trigger for this example so we going to write click trigger um so now it knows that the click trigger is part of the first step because we've indented it um everything is always indented one tab or four spaces um even though sometimes you end up with sections that look a little funny but they're all aligned on the left side that's very important um the next part we need is the script part of the clip trigger so we indent again and you have the script this is where we're going to list all the commands that happened when we use the click trigger um since the script part is a list you don't need to indent their part of the script section so each command starts with The Hyphen um because it's a list um the command we're going to use now was going to be chat and its arguments we're going to give it is hello world and you see I surrounded it with double quotes I suggest using double quotes whenever you're doing chatting and narrating and things where you're using long strings so that you can include single quotes inside of them um just so you can see a couple more commands we'll use a wait command which will Calla it to wait for one second after saying hello world and then we'll use another check command and we'll say my name is nbc. name now that's a replaceable tag and what happens is when the script is executed it'll replace that with the name of the NPC I we'll have probably a whole video with all the different kind of tags there's four or five dozen of them at this point um don't get worried about that one little thing uh so at this point you have your full script this is a very simple one and we're going to need to be able to assign assign it to an NPC to do that we actually going to be making an additional small script and we're going to call it assignment um you're going to want to use better naming conventions when you make your scripts but for this we're just I'm just showing you the the the two parts of your first example so your assignment script is going to be a type of assign assignment um just like the other one was indirect this one's an assignment script uh this one you're going to be assigning a direct scripts which you'll see conveniently this is an interact script um this is another list and all we're going to do is assign the script we're making in this case example script you'll see I put it 10 here that's the script priority which isn't relevant right now um but when you're assigning multiple interaction scripts they're going to need a priority later on so that's all there is to it um just to go over what we just did so that if there's any confusion hopefully we clear it up this is the this is one script it's the assignment script it assigns this interact script to the NPC um and it is a very small one it has two parts the type and then the list of interact scripts it's designing um they're slightly more elaborate later on give you some more information on those there's action and things involved in assignment scripts and then your interact script is another very simple script it's only one step with a click trigger that activates these three commands"

I'm saying continue game this is the exact same um settings you would have for when you're setting up a new game um you have your 24-hour cycle here and with this you can choose 5 minutes so day and night combined are a total of 5 minutes um all the way up to 50 minutes so day and night combined are 50 minutes um we go for 5050 just cuz you know nice the Cycles are are perfectly fine um what we do change now that we can cuz it used to be 50/50 now that we're allowed to with the latest uh patches we change our night cycle to only 20% because when it's night we generally don't go outside because of the zombies being dangerous um 20% means that 20% of the day is nighttime so about maybe 15 to 20 minutes U of of each cycle is nighttime uh friendly fire off obviously because we're not looking to PvP with each other there's no point uh Zombies Run default means that if there's enough light zombies will walk whereas if it's dark the zombies will run so night time they run um you can turn it to never run so no matter what you can just go out whenever and the zombies don't run or you can have always run like I explained before and then it doesn't matter there's no difference between day and night um player icons we have this on so we can see where each other are on the map um so it gives us an idea of you know where our buddies are um generally you would turn this off only if uh you were doing PVP there's no point in having it off otherwise block durability you can set how tough blocks are um now that's tough all around though because zombies will beat on blocks to break through them um but it also sets how tough blocks are for you as a player to break through whether you're using a pickaxe or stuff like that um yeah I I don't get five Cycles either I they put in the option which is nice um but a 5 minute day night cycle is ridiculous um drop on death if you die what do you drop um everyone knows you know in Minecraft you drop everything um in this you can drop nothing you can drop everything uh you can drop just your tool belt which is your hot bar down below um same as in Minecraft um or you can drop a backpack um which is uh whatever is in your inventory but not on your h bar so that's depending on what you prefer we go for tool belt only because that's the setting that the game started with it's what we're used to and it it when we said it to nothing for a while no one cared if they died because you didn't lose anything um so tool belt means there is a penalty for dying uh you can still go pick up the items before they despawn but there's the possibility of them disappearing um drop on quit that's an interesting option they put in if you're if you're having a public server um drop on quit would be actually something good to have um most people would probably set it to everything but that way somebody can't come into a public server take some high value materials they find and then just quit and leave and never come back and you know therefore destroy those materials um we have it set to nothing obviously cuz we we play with just our group um but that would be something good to keep in mind in case you're playing a public game or hosting a public server um damage given this is how much damage you give to the zombies um and to the environment this is how much uh damage the zombies give to you um actually we should set that up because like I said it's been easy for us enemy memory now this uh zombies in this game there's a stealth system now um and it uses the same icon as from the Elder Scroll series um the way the the enemy memory works is if an enemy spots you and actually starts hunting you how long does it take before they forget you were there before they stop hunting you um you can set it anywhere from 30 seconds all the way up to 90 seconds um enemy spawning this is how how much the enemy spawn obviously I was talking before we were on medium I'll set it to high now cuz we want more craft timer this is something that I first came across or I should say we first came across in Rust that this game has now um introduced uh anyone who's played rust knows that it takes you have to take time on most servers to craft stuff um in this game we prefer no crafting timer since we're playing on you know a private server and we're not playing PVP or anything um I suppose if we were playing PVP or or or something like that we we could probably set it to um normal or fast and Fast is halftime um so you know that's the settings um but for the most part I don't like crafting timers it's just tedious it creates downtime um the only plus side of it in this game is that if you start crafting something in your inventory it'll keep crafting um while you're moving around so you can go around doing other stuff whilst the stuff you started crafting is crafting inside of your inventory so that's kind of cool uh loot timer this is do you want it to take a certain amount of time to open up crates and and uh desks and fridges and other things to try to get um loot out of them um we set it to fast because excuse me um we set it to fast hey Matt quiet down we set it to fast because uh it actually creates a little bit of an element of survivability for us that we can't just run through a building loot everything at light speed and run out um we actually have to take a little bit of time looting stuff normal is way too slow in my opinion um so we just keep it at fast um CH mode this is if you want to allow debugging tools um we have it on um because it allows us now we we found a couple of errors in the game since the newest patch um one caused me to completely crash lose my whole inventory lose everything I had including an augur which is extremely rare um so we have this on right now in case we need to um use debugging tools for any type of glitches or errors we find to replace something that people lose um we don't use it to spawner anything or or anything else whatsoever um yes I see that my son's saying hi to the camera you got to back up they can't really see you but um yeah so we have that on just in case anything happens because as you saw from me playing um I wasn't spawning anything for myself I was just playing so uh public or private very simple do you want it to appear on the public list of games or do you want it to be private private means that your buddies can join because they'll see that you're in the game and they can join it uh max players you can go from anywhere from 2 to 16 players right now um which is pretty impressive um I know in Minecraft to go beyond I think it was an eight or 10 player limit you had to once again edit in your um in your server settings in your config file um we have it at 16 just for however many of our uh buddies want to join uh so far we've had up to nine of the MMA guys in one game so far um password self-explanatory um put a password on if you want a password so um game Port that's just the standard Port don't mess with it um but that if your port for foring that's the port that you use for port forwarding n punch through is a automatic port forwarding uh thing that they patched into the game in Alpha 6 um so that you shouldn't have to port forward but in case you do you have the 25,000 port to put into your router and that was long-winded um I apologize but yeah I I you guys Mr Sarah told me that some people wanted to know about the game so I was explaining the game"

        "transcript": "Hi, I'm Steve Jones, and I am going to tell\nyou how a light bulb works. Well, first of all we have to see the construction of the\nlight bulb. In fact, the working part is what we call a filament which is a thin piece of\nmetal, and this gets white hot. It glows very, very hot, and of course, if it was in the\nair it would actually burn away. So, we enclose this in a bulb of glass which is sealed with\na screw thread on here to attach it to the place it's being put, and we have two legs\nhere on which we hang the filament. These are usually tungsten. The electricity comes\nin at one connection here at the bottom in the middle, and it goes up through here through\nthe wire, and then down and comes out through the screw thread at the side, or sometimes\nwe've got what's called a bayonet connection. It depends on which country you're in. Either\na screw thread or a bayonet. A bayonet is just flat. You push it in, and turn it, and\nit jams. So, the glass bulb is evacuated; that is, there is no air in here. If there\nwere air in here this, as soon as it got hot, would burn away. You don't want that. What\nyou do is you put in a gas which won't allow burning. You remove the oxygen in here, and\nyou put in argon gas, so this contains argon and won't burn so this can become white-hot\nand it will produce mainly light. Well, not mainly light, actually, about ten percent\nis light. Most of it is heat, and this glass bulb will get very hot. Normally, these bulbs\nhave a power of around sixty watts, so the sixty watts is a an average. They, in fact,\ngo from something like twenty five watts up to two hundred and fifty watts. A two hundred\nand fifty watts lamp will actually use a current of one ampere. A twenty five watt, of course,\nwill produce, will use a tenth of an amp. So, there we have an electric light bulb and\nhow it works."

        "transcript": "how do you do folks how are yall doing today you're probably wondering what the hell are all these games doing on my bed well today I'm going to rant about Xbox 360 DVD cases and DVD cases cuz I don't know what the hell is going on with some of these DVD cases lately but you'll notice some of these games you buy they come in these really cheap ass cases I mean you spend $60 for some of these damn games well this one wasn't 60 it was only uh $17.99 very good game though very good game but like some of the DVD cases they're like this and they're very easy to open and some of them are like this this isn't the case this game originally came in I swapped it with a an Xbox 360 case I gave the Xbox case to another game but you'll see some cases like this there basically this little thing you have to pry the game out of and these are very very frustrating fol folks because you're so afraid you're going to crack your game cuz look at this you have to like pry it out of there luckily it doesn't have any scratches but uh it's very frustrating and I don't like sticking it back in there cuz I'm afraid I'm going to crack it but uh it doesn't crack it but uh it always scares you though when you stick it in there you're like oh God I'm going to crack this $60 game this isn't $60 though I paid like 50 for this when it came out though it's not a bad game Call of chut dark corners of the Earth there were supposed to be like two or three sequels but uh they never happen for some reason never happened and you might notice too some of these new 360 cases they'll come in something like this this is a DVD and you'll have like the background like that except the Box will be green I bought this used for $5 that's in pretty good condition very good movie if you like James Bond I think you like this one John Travolta it's very good in that one but some of these new 360 cases are really cheap I don't know I've had two friends that have had these cases where they' like put their games in and take them out and it's like they crack the game but my friend Adam he got a Call of Duty um Black Ops for his birthday and I guess he's got one of those cases kind of like this where you have to like pry him out of there to like pry him out of there and cracked his disc a little bit and that's uh that's not good folks cuz these games are expensive here's an older case for Xbox 360 Quake 4 you just kind of push down and uh pops out very easy to use and of course there's a whole bunch of other ones like here's a different design one one it's kind of like a you just kind of push down down and pull it out there's another one that's very strange looking let's see if I can find it oh here it is here's the King Kong for the Xbox 360 you can see this is another one of those uh weird looking push things to like push down that doesn't sound good when you push down like that sounds like it's cracking it but it's not and um you can see there there's no scratches or anything but I think if you continue to constantly pop this thing out and put it back in and pop it out you probably would crack your game then there's cases like this that're kind of strange looking where you kind of just uh kind of push and pull it out like that this game was frustrating I'll tell you that very frustrating especially on Hell mode I never did beat it on Hell mode but uh if you're looking for a good witch game don't get bullet witch get a Bayonetta much better game I liked it better than Devil May Cry 4 too by the way you'll see some cases like this where you just kind of push down and pull it out which are much easier to use in my opinion I like those a lot better there's a Guitar Hero Aerosmith there's another one of those uh funky designs here's another one very similar to that last one here's our old Xbox case here's a gun very similar to the other one and then U here's another crazy case this is one of the original uh Xbox 360 games when it first came out see it's another one of those cases you have to like pry it out of there and I don't know I hate these cases oh that one came out easily that time but uh some of these cases I don't know I don't like them folks they like when you take your games out and continue to take them out it feels like they're cracking or something when you take them out and I don't like the sound of that but sorry to hear about your game Adam really am that stinks $60 o but if I you i' to go to Microsoft or the company that made the game or the company that made the box to the game but uh I hate these DVD cases like this and like I said they're doing it now in the 360 game boxes too it's kind of hard to get out that time you'll see it's like that and I don't know it's it's cheap looking it's recycled DVD cases and 360 cases that are doing that that's a that's cheap come on y'all don't be cheap asses we pay enough money for these damn games and DVDs that you can at least give us a nice case don't give us a little piece of gez but uh that's all I got to say I will see y'all later thanks for watching thank thanks for listening or see you say byebye"

        "transcript": "so this is my review for the shimpo Aspire pottery wheel um I cannot say enough good things about this wheel uh we actually bought four of these for some classes that I was teaching at our local Museum here um the reason we bought them is because they were almost the cheapest new wheel that you can buy on the market if not the cheapest um but they're super light super portable um and we don't have a permanent uh Pottery space at our Museum so uh these are great because we can just pick them up put them on tables I mean we even put them on fairly rickety card tables um or like uh banquet type tables that are portable tables and it works really great um as you can see some of the features here just get in a little closer this is a it comes with a couple of removable bats so you can take your Pottery off I mean obviously you can see this wheel is well used and there's good reason for it because it's a Workhorse it has this nice removable splash pan you can just take that right off of there and go wash it um it actually has two platforms up here which I just have covered with Clay right now from projects um but you can actually put tools and water up there um you can see all these little projects over here that I've made using this wheel and these are just real simple things um I've got a plate sitting over here but as you can see I'm I mean I'm sitting outside with this wheel I've just got it sitting on my back porch um I'm just throwing outside in the sunshine um and it I mean it's absolutely amazing um I'm going to show you I'm going to go ahead and do a little demonstration for you here throw a pot so you can see just how impressive this thing is I was I have to admit I was a little concerned when I first bought this wheel cuz I've seen those little toy wheels and it seems like everybody always buys those toy Wheels they're probably 25 or $50 um you can buy them and um so many little kids have bad experiences with those cuz they actually try to use them and then they realize that it's not really a real pottery wheel it barely spins the motor is battery powered um so I just I was apprehensive about buying a wheel that was going to be crappy that wasn't going to be stable um you know when you put pressure on this to Center you have to make sure that it's not going to slide back forth and this thing's just heavy enough and it's got really great rubber bumpers on the bottom that hold it really steady as you can see it's not doing any wobbling on me has a lot of power I've never pushed on this thing hard enough to make it strain I don't think I could uh it says the manufacturers say that it'll Center up to 25 lb of clay which if you don't know what 25 lbs of clay is that's a block about this big I mean that's a whole bag of clay and uh I can't even Center 25 lbs of clay doesn't matter how strong the wheel is that's really difficult diffult but as you can see it's got plenty of power plenty of speed pretty quiet I'm talking over the over the sound of the wheel and you shouldn't be having too much trouble hearing me it's got really great speed control so as I'm throwing I can just slow it down to a nice reasonable speed get straight back to throwing oops I uh because this is a removable splash pan you have to make sure it's locked on I I was demonstrating that and I left it unlocked but see that I mean just a dream to throw with um the speed control is really great because you can go all the way down in some ways this has better control than some of the really expensive freestanding wheels that I've had you do control it with this little lever with your hand which is actually kind of nice in my opinion CU especially for beginners when you're trying to push on the pedal with your foot and think about your hands it gets kind of confusing this way you set the speed and just leave it and you can go back in here and trim the rim off or do whatever you need to do super slow motion super smooth gliding and uh I mean yeah it's just it's just a phenomenal wheel"

        "transcript": "well President Obama's in now more States one out tens of thousands of people signing internet petitions pushing to have their state succeed from the U the union and it sounds like Ron Paul says well maybe they have a right to do it the Texas Republican Congressman on the phone now Congressman it sounds like uh you've really gotten behind this big time you're the biggest name I've seen attached to this so far why do you think this is a good idea well I haven't taken the position that I think secession is a good idea but to principle is a good idea you know I'm not calling for secession but I think if the secession would have been very clear on the books the government would be much smaller today because the federal government couldn't run rough shod over the people and over the state so I think that principle is very important I think when you can't leave it's a very bad thing as is the absence of Freedom you know if if you can't leave your job you're called a slave if you can't leave a prison then you if you can't leave a jail you're a prisoner and you know one of the statements that used to be made in a totalitarian country when they've lost their freedom is when you can't leave your country you know woodro Wilson actually used one of the major reasons to fight World War I was the right of self-determination so that's what I'm interested in I'm interested in people being able to leave if they don't like and the founders more or less endorse that idea Jefferson has a great quote on on why secession should uh be permissible so it's not it's not such an extreme idea I don't think I think it would have been a great thing and I think our we' have had a lot more freedoms in a much smaller federal government if that principle had blasted what's that Jefferson quote by the way well I don't have it right in front of me but I can sure dig it up all right well we'll be looking for it next time what do you make though that that so many people actually do like this idea that so many people are this frustrated with this country and with this government what does that say about the state of America well I think it uh I think the justification is is there it means that we have have a mess and that they no longer can depend on the federal government to deliver and that's when you know the major crisis hits when there's no more confidence that the dollars will buy anything and the entitlements won't come this whole system falls apart and uh that is the reason why I think local government and independent government is is very very important but it tells you that the people think this thing is a real mess and and they're right about it I I think we're only at the beginning of the unwinding of the problems that we've had building for so many decades so uh the the uh the working out of this is going to going to take a while so so representative Paul uh everyone's still doing Monday morning quarterbacking the postmortem if you will on the election uh what was it about Mitt Romney that uh I mean real quickly you know you you really weren't a fan you didn't get behind him at all uh you have a ton of loyal followers perhaps uh you know if you have thrown your weight behind him perhaps he could have won this thing I doubt I doubt that because I don't think one person can carry votes besides I would have been the one that lost credibility because uh although I got along quite well on a personal basis with uh uh Governor Romney uh we didn't have much in agreement you know on on policy when you look at when you look at a foreign policy and and the spending he wanted to spend $2 trillion more on the military and uh he was not much into civil liberties at all he and he was he was a strong protectionist uh I mean bashing China and putting on sanctions sanctions to me are acts of War uh so I always felt mixed feelings because I sort of liked him and uh our families got along real well but there wasn't much that we agreed with so if all of a sudden I say oh I've disagreed with everything he says practically but now I say okay everybody vote for him nobody would have understood that I got to tell you that's one of the reasons you have such an amazing loyal following and I do I do want to ask real quick it feels like in this postmortem that the Republican Party may be coming to an epiphany that you had a lot of things right especially on social issues in this country I mean you think maybe the GOP is going to lean in your direction going forward well that's hope so I know that they at least have a more open mind about looking at the Federal Reserve you know and at the last minute there they started talking about well maybe the FED is too powerful maybe they print too much money and they have they can do too much unsupervised so yes I I think they will but uh I think it won't come quickly and that's why I'm so delighted to go to the college campuses because the young people seem to have a much more open mind and I think it usually takes you know a while uh to to change the course of a country but I think as we were just talking about this economy is going to get a lot worse they're going to have to look for something and I think some of the ideas that I've talked about became more credible after the recession hit you know the major crisis 5 years ago because I had talked so much about financial bubbles in the hous a lot of people say you predicted all of this now I said that was going to be the last one but I do have to ask about uh about Rand Paul uh expressing perhaps some interest in running what what do you make of it uh you know you're very popular amongst young people he's a fresh voice and a kind of person that a lot of people are looking perhaps to come in are you excited about the prospect well it certainly would be exciting it just happens that he and I have not had a conversation on this so it seems like we years a long way off you know the the election is over when is the next next election going to start the next day these days the election can't the election cycle never stops these days you know that representative Ron Paul I got to tell you I've learned so much from you personally over the last several years uh there's a reason you're a legend amongst people who follow you I thank you for taking the time out thanks for having me on Char good to be with you all right now with the economy looking like an ugly doll a union battle that's getting even uglier Toys R R Us CEO Jerry St isn't playing around he's actually here next"
