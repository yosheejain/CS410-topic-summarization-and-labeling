        "transcript": "hey everyone this is Zach at CES we are here with Jeff of Research In Motion and he's going to give us a quick demo of the Playbook 2.0 operating system which is going to be coming to Consumers next month so take it away Jeff thanks Zach um Playbook 2.0 uh Playbook OS 2.0 that is um you know really makes a number of uh of enhancements in in three main areas um the first is in Communications the second is around productivity and the third's around how your blackberry and smartphone or Blackberry tablet and smartphone work together going to focus on um that first bucket of communications here in this short uh in this short segment um the first thing that uh that users will see is that uh OS 2.0 incorporates a built-in messages application and so this um this consolidates all of your personal professional email um as as well as um uh social networking accounts like uh like LinkedIn and Twitter and many others um but uh this gives you kind of a Unified Inbox similar to what you would be accustomed to with a Blackberry smartphone where you can not only receive all those messages but also send messages too so I can send you know a Twitter direct message for instance um to people that I'm following uh right from the Unified Inbox this also allows me to uh extend kind of Playbook strength of multitasking to email so if I'm typing an email here um and I see that my LED indicator is going uh that means that I've got something new in my inbox I can go back to my inbox and see what that is I've got a message here from carollyn that want to respond to so I can go and I can uh type my response to Carolyn but I haven't lost my place in the in the original email message that I was composing so you've got really powerful uh email composing and you'll notice here that you've got um a full Suite of Rich Text um editing and and composing options too um if we go into the calendar application which is another one of the Native or built-in applications or sorry contacts application um a built-in native application um again we're um you know extending this uh this this real social integration um with the ability to consolidate multiple sources of information about a single individual into you know a complete contact card so I've got my colleague Mike clly here and um this uh one uh contact entry for Mike is being populated by both public information and um information that uh that I have access to as a friend of Mikes or a follower of mics on Twitter for instance um through uh his LinkedIn profile and also through the rim um corporate address book and so that's all presented to me in one um unified uh contact card I'm able to go in and see Mike's latest uh tweets latest status updates able to go in and see information about the company that Mike works for and I'd be able to go in and see um you know past and upcoming meetings that I have with Mike um just by looking at his contact card so that's just uh one of the ways that we're extending um social into the contacts application the last thing I want to show you is the new calendar application so um you know you've got all of your standard calendaring functionality you know a day view agenda view the ability to layer multiple calendars so I can turn on and off my Enterprise calendar for instance or turn on or off my uh my Gmail calendar but what's really neat is that we've taken that social integration and brought it into the calendar experience too so I'm actually able to go in to my day and get a people view of my day so here are all the people that I'm going to be meeting with during my day and I'm able to touch on those individuals and get information about them so I think you know for um mobile salese I mean this is great you're able to understand who you're going to be meeting with get the gist on those people before you walk into that meeting um and uh you know look at your day uh around uh bu or get a view of your day built around relationships as opposed to just um you know meeting contents and and and uh and scheduled events sure Jee you also had mentioned some new bridge functionality yeah so how about I give you a moment to grab your phone sure and we can uh swing into that as well Playbook o 2.0 also adds um some functionality to allow your Blackberry smartphone and Blackberry tablet to work better together um one of the ways that we do that is through something we call openon Playbook so I've got this picture that I shot on my smartphone and um you know the tablet is actually you know an optimized experience for for enjoying or consuming you know that uh that that photo because of its large screen so I can select on uh the menu open on playbook and that photo actually gets sent um seamlessly to my tablet um so that I can enjoy it or or plug it into the HDMI port on the bottom and uh and share it with a larger audience so that openon Playbook functionality um Works in a number of different scenarios um so it would actually also work in a uh in a web link I can come in here I can uh select open link on playbook and it's going to launch the browser and navigate to uh to end gadget's website um so again you know optimized for um enabling you to choose the right tool for the task um one other little thing that we wanted to show you was um an Android application uh running on the BlackBerry PlayBook and it's important to note that um you know we aren't supporting the Android Marketplace but we're making Android applications available in Blackberry app world for users to download along with all the other applications that we've got available today um so cool break is an example of an Android app um and it uh it gets launched from the home screen just like any other application you can go in um I can choose to uh to play a game of pool here um and uh I haven't played this one yet oops you will be playing the breaking shot okay so I can move this around here can line up my shot and I pull this back and I can shoot the ball right and I can minimize that um using the the the uh swipe from the frame gesture um just like any other app so here's just one example of of the uh of some of the Android apps that'll be coming to the the Blackberry platform with Playbook os20 looks great Jeff thank you for showing us these new features we really appreciate thank you for showing us"

        "transcript": "espn and it's called x games snow cross now you can see at the beginning of this game it plays a video video works great on the ipad super smooth and look at that nice a big extension tries to get down on the inside all right let's skip the rest of the video here and get right to the game so a race an arcade go and choose the default i will race uh breckenridge with levi and let's go so here you can see this is an opengl es game so it really drives the graphics hardware again this is an unmodified game right off the app store i'm steering it with the accelerometer and even the game i can take full screen so you can see hey some tricks uh you can see that even with an open gls game very graphically intense you get tremendous frames and i'd say having played uh some games on here they're smooth and they're incredibly fun so so there you go right out of the app store unmodified so the great thing is all of those iphone apps that you know and love that you've already been running will run on your ipad in fact when you buy your new ipad just take it home hook it up to itunes download all those apps that you already have right onto your ipad and you're good to go now if the developer spends some time modifying their application they can take full advantage of this large touchscreen display and you can see that's what we did for all of our applications we rewrote the user interface of every one of our apps to take full advantage of this large touchscreen display that comes with the ipad like photos and music calendar and youtube they all look great and we expect developers are going to want to do the same thing so to that end we've enhanced the iphone sdk to now support development for the ipad as well and we're releasing this sdk today so developers developers can go to apple.com today and download the sdk and get going and this sdk even includes an ipad simulator so you can run your ipad apps right on your mac as you develop them you know we think it's going to be a whole nother gold rush for developers as they build apps for the ipad and of course every ipad comes with the app store loaded up on it so you have a great distribution channel to get your apps out to all of our customers now we're going to take and highlight and feature all of the apps that are built specifically for the ipad in the store you'll still be able to get to all of the iphone apps but if you create an application specifically for the ipad we're going to put it front and center now we're we're really excited about the possibilities for developers on the ipad and so just about two weeks ago we invited a few developers to apple to give them a sneak peek at the ipad and see what they could create in just a couple short weeks i'd like to invite a few of them on stage to show you what they've created starting with gameloft gameloft is one of the largest developers of games for the iphone and ipod touch they have over 60 games on the app store that have been downloaded more than 55 million times to show you what they've been able to do in just a couple weeks on the ipad i'd like to invite up mark hickey mark scott thank you good morning today my colleague bogdan and i are here to show you some amazing new gameplay mechanics that we've worked into our award-winning first-person shooter called nova so what's different about nova on the ipad versus nova on the iphone or the ipod touch well when you hold the device in your hands you'll see the display is just huge which makes the game immensely fun to play but the size also gives you a lot more flexibility when it comes to controlling the game for example i can slide the d-pad up and down the side of the screen or if i want to quickly access some firepower i can drag the rocket launcher down next to the fire button so with the controls set up how we like take a look at the bottom left corner of the screen we've added a mini map and you can stretch the mini map minimap out across the screen just by dragging the corner with your finger when we do that you'll notice that there's this red dot on the screen this tells us that there's an enemy nearby well another cool feature that we've added is that now you you can slide two fingers across the screen to throw grenades like so and shot so the ipad gives us the ability to interact with the game world in ways that weren't really possible before in order to open these air locks you physically apply three fingers to the control disc and turn your hand in order for the passage to open now we all know that first person shooters are about combat so we designed a system that we're calling mta multiple target acquisition with the rocket launcher selected you can drag a targeting box around a group of enemies and then fire on all of them simultaneously check it out definitely useful when you're out gunned and outnumbered now this is what we were able to accomplish in just a few short days working with this exciting new hardware the games look incredible at this higher resolution and the form factor opens up countless new doors for us in terms of game design you'll be able to see what else we have in store for you in the ipad version of nova ships later this year thank you very much"

        "transcript": "if you're looking for a meaty alternative to beef then this is the right game we're cooking venison I don't think I've had venison before then now is your chance to try it we're gonna do a fantastic venison and mushroom stew with creamy brandy sauce and serve very interesting cauliflower rice we'll come back to the right in a minute but first shallot and garlic so take a pick I'll have the garlic garlic two cloves peeled and crushed jamie shalat nice and fine and while you do that I have a look at the venison now you say you've never had venison for know what we need to do is cut off the really thick fat so we've got all this amazing meat underneath and this fat or something like venison is quite leathery quite tough so you can that you just cut against it and it just cut it away I think the reason I haven't had it for us wait beer isn't it yes it's not cheap but here's one of those things you can have a special occasion if you can't hold of it so you can just use beef this isn't awesome stew just repeat so I'm going to cut into quite chunky pieces but any kind of globules of fat we come along the way get rid of those it's for the sort of meat that you can cook two different ways like rare medium well-done yet you've got venison steaks no problem having that as a sort of medium rare or medium in fact it's better that way would you put that in the same way it's late for the same amount of time pretty much pretty much quite seasonal thing so you don't really get it in so in the UK in autumn treat it the same way steak which is what we're gonna do this today watch for some bacon there but a smokiness I'm just going to chop that up as well like what you want to do it's all lies I've no idea enough of that a shot of oil into our pan if you can add all your onion and garlic into there and then I'm going to give you the mushrooms now these are just chestnut mushrooms we've got some regular kind of button mushrooms big button mushrooms as well yeah you can use whatever even get hold up just target some wild mushrooms would be brilliant so if you can just take the again we're getting quite chunky so I would suggest maybe quarters something like that would be my deal as you can see our onions have begun to soften cuz then carry on cooking but we'll add the bacon in with it but start your nice and crispy and then plenty of black pepper Jay yep and then with the heat as high as it will go I'm going to put all of that venison in there as well okay as we said you don't have to cook this all the way through so this is quite a quick cook dish will be about 15-20 minutes and total it's not a long stirring process now you can see all these bits that have stuck to the bottom yet all the meat you want all that kind of type of juice up so the brandy does exactly that and it would just take all those fantastic bits off the bottom you'd left like a pan they call it and it's all that flavor nothing is lost and now that's all in there we can add 200 ml of cream with 100 ml of water okay so we're thinning out the cream because lots going to battery out what is that single cream and double double cream or heavy cream heavy cream and if you've got all your mushrooms in there as well yeah we can also add in a couple knobs of butter to enrich it a tablespoon of tomato puree did you have to put it like that and half a heap chicken stock and that is everything that needs to go in there to get a good mix up Jay house 2 needs about 15 minutes rub it away so in the meantime I want you to take this large cauliflower into really sort of rough chunks like that would be brilliant because we're going to make a fantastic cauliflower and rice and I say rice I mean rice it looks like rice so it's a visual thing and all we need is a food processor or greater and we're just going to put it all into this all the chunks that Mike's done in here put the lid on and give it a good blitz up so you end up with something looks like rice grains keep going into you got rid of all the big lumps and then with a bit of luck we're left with this fantastic kind of Rhine strains of raw cut cut and then all we need to do is tip over the out into there and season it really really well lots of salt pepper a tiny dribble of oil and then Jamie you can cling film over that yeah as it cooks really simply really quickly just four minutes in a microwave full power but you want to trap all of that air and moisture in this as it cooks and kind of half steams as well so to recap we need to this bubble wait for another sort of ten minutes or so that's going to go into microwave for four minutes and then we can serve up an amazing creamy mushroom and venison stew side for the cling film off we'll sprinkle in our fresh parsley give that a good stir up it does look like wrong it does look like right and because it's well seasoned on a common it's very very beautiful so we've put plenty of this cauliflower on here and a generous ladle of this awesome venison mushroom stew love smell amazing look at that plenty of that juice it's tiny sprinkle of parsley and there it is venison and mushroom stew with cauliflower rice sorted really intrigued by the school aerospace iconic that sausage was really good really low in carbs an amazingly rich hmm it's got one of them liver its Gosling liver kidney and steak ready really nice move if you're looking for something meat easy quick a date Mike's number is Oh seven nine to three otherwise check out the website sorting food comm for plenty boards issues"

        "transcript": "so here the FTF 2011 at genesy you're launching your new board with IMX 53 yes so what's new with this um well for one size this is the old 51 board this is the 53 board so you can see it's a third maybe even a fourth of the size we integrated everything very very much and at the same time the reason for that is to reduce cost so this is actually the PCB of an entire netbook everything runs here yes before did you have stuff on both sides or is it new that course yes so it's also but the complexity has been decreased in order to minimize cost you have to remember that we're targeting uh developing countries with this um although they will be available for example in in in the states and Europe as well um but the main target is developing countries we have to get the cost as low as possible so that's what we Tred to do with this board I'm pretty sure that there's no cheaper version than this one anyway so this is as cheap as as cheap as we can possibly make it the cheapest IMX 53 based board in the OR cheapest right arm part motherboard for full desktop quality Computing right 1080p video playback so you can output to a 1080p screen with this one too so 1080p video playback um you got you know a gahz IMX 53 CPU you know you can basically do anything you want to so how how cheap is it going to be you have any Targets we we don't have any official targets yet they'll be announced somewhere during or after FDF but not at this time yet it's below1 199 or can you not say I can say that it could maybe spe you can't say considering go to our website right now you can buy our 51 based products for I think it's $199 for the net book and $129 for the net top so go to the website go buy them you can see them right there so this is a pixel G version and uh right here we are checking out the the the smartbook and the smart top so29 for that it's up actually a retail price on your website go to the website $129 one in Netbook uh $199 what this really you are selling like uh was out of stock every 5 minutes or you actually have it we have in St we have them in stock anybody can go and buy for $199 go buy them right now nice and it's going to be cheaper the next yes this next version will be we try to get them cheaper awesome this is I mean this is 1080p video by the way so IMX 51 decoding 1080p video displaying on 720p because IMX 51 doesn't have the bandwidth for that but still we deod 1080p video here uh this is on this screen you can see the same principle with a GL context and an open VG context so running at the same time and that's the user interface that we have right now weeler cool how soon is uh this ready ready summer summer will win summer now sum well next summer okay in the US you're over summer and Finland summer just starts right now so let's say July August somewhere around cool so uh is a software when you have this software going on here this what you when you talk about this how much work is there to make it work on the new board it's running it's running yes the idea is to everything that we've been doing over the past couple of months or year even on software optimization for IMX 51 is directly usable on IMX 53 so I wouldn't be surprised if this is the fastest 1080p decoding board uh from with a f scale IMX 53 right now can you say a little bit what the differences between 51 53 in terms of um in general 53 has higher bandwidth uh higher bandwidth to the memory higher bandwidth for the ipu and the vpus and so on you also have a higher clock frequency at least 1 GHz maybe up to 1.2 GHz uh in certain applications um yeah so a little bit faster better bandwidth more features can you point to some things that were cut out some somehow or is possible to kind of compare or no just better integration better everything that's here is kind of here as well well of course we removed some of the stuff um but by using higher integration we can scale the whole thing down of course certain features on this one are still missing like HDMI output but that's because this one is aimed at a net book product right now so you can see this is where it's going to fit something like this the rest is going to be a flat battery but that's the entire Netbook uh card what if you add a HDMI does that add too much cost or uh we have another board that is basically ready to go that has all the features on it so this is just a very low cost version we have a more advanced version that can be used in other things but this one would fit in for for a notbook and a tablet for example nice so in June and July August they might actually be finalized design that's somewhere right now in China being put together or something uh well yeah you can say maybe you can okay cool and what are you going to call it is there a name it's now right now it's called EPA MX we were thinking about something like well it's not set yet but something playing wrong high definition or something that I it's not not yet set all right that's uh looking is it going to be fast enough every every consumer is going to be happy with this Define every consumer if you want to replace your quad core Intel laptop no if you want to have a netbook that can run for8 hours on a single battery charge that can decode video while you're on the train that provides 3G and wireless mobility and and a whole bunch of other features in a small light box and yes how much battery does it how much power consumption um well to give you an idea to really give you the idea of how much power this consumes three cell battery we can run between 6 to 8 hours depending on what you're doing that's a three cell battery an Intel atom needs six cells for that so on a six cell battery if we would do that we can between 12 and 16 hours of light USB yes same screen when you move to sorry if you would use a pixel G screen you can actually get much higher battery lifesty know it's actually powered off so that's a pixel G screen I can demo this properly right now but actually look awesome Sun you need to go outside for so this is a e laptop the pixel G and uh we tried to turn off the back light to and now I'm putting it on again see when it's totally off it's just perfectly readable out here let's go out a little bit more in the in the Sun and here you can see complete reflection let's go and uh launch the Chrome web browser all right 300% accelerated that's cool pixel G and arm at genesy the best combination"

we're gonna get carried in our new video of Leon Fey he's a new hero he's been out for a couple weeks now so is sought of LA and I've just been playing on the rift guys if I don't upload to youtube doesn't mean I'm not playing Hawk or league of legends I love MOBAs and I love this stuff dude and then when I'm done playing and I pass out at the end of the days i'm just sick tired of battling and winning and losing and all this i flip on freakin videos like this dude and I watched dota tournaments and stuff i'm obsessed with it so i do apologize i haven't uploaded for a while but it doesn't mean I'm not playing don't don't get yourself wrong here and straighten that out it's just that I like to save it for the YouTube video I like to save it for the channel my first time playing them and I never record for you to unless I'm in a good mood so all right let's go on ahead we're gonna go ahead and do our Lu Yunfei let's go ahead and see if we can unlock in bio 2 emblems or by wounds all the way up with fruits Thank You gameloft and yeah let's take a look at them real quick difficulties pretty low physical is super duper high magicals media and resilience media and support is higher than medium i am going to do my introduction this is Lu Yunfei was originally the living weapon of master fighter kuya lon and together they were unstoppable however through their victories through their victories oh my god all right we're just gonna start over because I can't read I'm sorry guys need to go back to school the living weapon Lu Yunfei was originally the living weapon of master fighter qu yuan and together they were unstoppable however though their victories grew more and more numerous Queen wan became worried that it was louia fa who is truly the one achieving these success instead of her so one day she laid down this weapon and struck out on her own her and enraged by this abandonment Lu Yunfei began tracking down other living weapons and draining their essences eventually becoming powerful enough to build himself a human body wow I really like you and Lu Yunfei have been playing against him and he's super strong I've been playing against a really good once he gets banned and ranked a lot but I don't think he's permanently banned right Kelly is he permanently been in rank Kelly I don't know Kelly hi yes oh yes actually okay yeah you thermally been in ranked I've seen a lot of people building tank but of course I haven't play admit I haven't played him on unique ounces my first time playing I just want to go ahead and go through spell so you guys can take a look the first one is called lightning firstly on faith versus weapon at a position creating an area filled with lightning that deals 40 plus the percentage physical damage per second this lightning area last four seconds the skill will add a lightning mark on the affected heroes that lasts for three seconds all right Lord of lightning if there is a lightning area actively unpayable teleport to the Aryan deal 90 plus a higher percentage physical damage to any and surround him if there is no lightning area actively available duel 90 plus a high percentage for the damage to any enemies directly around in this skill at a lightning mark to affected heroes for three seconds and reduce their movement speed by forty percent passive lightning laceration Liam phase normal attack on target with lightning mark deals three percent of the current hvs bonus physical damage so that is a percentage HP I didn't really see had percentage HP damage active if there's a target with the lightning mark within eight meters Liam Fey will move to behind the target and deal eighty plus fifty percent physical damage to them and they cool down time of this will be reduced to five sec 5 seconds if not Leah and fail we'll add a lightning mark on all enemy heroes the last reviewing all right its ultimate lightning kick lien fan leashes a powerful kick that launches in enemy 30 meters in the opposite direction and deals 100-plus high percentages with the avintia the skill is used again within three seconds Lee in Fayette will rush to the target and deal an additional 300 alright so yeah I keep saying high percentage of me and percentage just because this little factor here next to these numbers like the red that you see is is is the scaling of how much ad he has so like if you know if you have a claymore then it's you know 40 plus point 3 times however much damage to claim work in the you know I mean so that's that's what it is I'm just saying it so that I can play with it and know it all right Callie just trying it into a game right hopefully we'll get one like her at a time well let's let's go ahead and see him and I'm gonna throw the video on me thanks for watching guys appreciate it I'm gonna go ahead and pause this recording whenever we're in a game oh I'm just gonna go ahead and pause at me and Callie actually got into a lobby which is sweet so hopefully make some [\u00a0__\u00a0] happen it looks like everybody on our team wants to play fighters Kelly my uncle Macon whole fighter game yep or you can just play John brew protect me all right protecting you the whole game and just make me have an awesome game from a youtube channel that's the plan make it look good always desecration bloodletting blood freeze actually Kelly's John burrs really good I forgot was any one of your most played heroes yeah I main drummer yeah see that's it out that's what I was really do I was I didn't care about myself I was trying to make cali look good get him on his huh get him on his main blow the [\u00a0__\u00a0] up this is gonna be a fun game really I can't wait I've actually been getting messed up by Leon face so kind of it's a little ridiculous that I waited so long to record but like I said I only record if I'm in a good mood like I won't ever I don't know I want to treat it like a job and like record all day to do all this stuff this is not what my youtube channel ever was like my youtube channel was always just something special to me I don't recognize any of these players but they have a strong team they have good heroes all right this is the drag and drop I think he's probably best bot Lane and she think or maybe roaming in jungle yeah it is much of a roamer because he can teleport so it's pretty good a ganking yeah I'll gank your lane then it was like me all right well let's room together are you roam over there I'm gonna go clear a jungle meet boring have fun"

        "transcript": "if accessing fans I'm Smitty welcomed in this corner TV com with light heavyweight champion chad dawson as he readies for Glen Johnson rematch November the 7th this one in Hartford Connecticut to Chad welcome thank you for having me would be before we get to this fight coming up let's talk about you last two battles with antonio tarver was it was it tough having to face him again you pretty much handled him the first time and then you had to immediately give the the rematch was that difficult at all mentally at least yeah it wasn't too difficult with me to count the fact that I have beat him so easily the first time and then you know to eat for me to have to give him a rematch you know so I mean and in that point it was it was kind of a difficult fight for me to get up for because I knew that you know he always came back great for all three matches so I mean I wasn't shake for the file prepared for so and I beat him again another nanima decision so you know me if that means in a sense it's difficult it was difficult because the last two years of my life hitman face around Glen Johnson antonio tarver you know I'm 27 years old you know I suppose my second rematch with Glen Johnson I over twice you know so that's two years two years died for like you know I've been my Korean involve around these guys so you know ready to get past this fight you know beat Glen Johnson and going on to bigger and better things and there's a lot of stuff out there we'll get to that in a moment but first we'll talk about the the road warrior that first fight you want it close fight tough fight what do you remember about that battle with him a year and a half ago I remember everything about the fight it was a great fight exciting fight you know um you know I like I don't I don't I don't think the fight was closed everybody thought it was you know I mean I know I got up I know the first five or six rounds you know I had to leave i took the first five or six round you know you know and then he called me he called me the couple good shots in early around you know and that was just me me being myself you know if I get hit with a good shot you know I'm gonna come right back so you know I got into a little slugfest with him in the home a couple rounds you know I think and I think just the fact that no people saw me get hit with some hard shots not that that he hurt me that much but they see me get hit with some hard shots and you know and I didn't go anywhere but I think that that stuck in their minds and they wouldn't you see me get hit so made the fight seem a little closer to him you know saying so I mean this fight you know one erase that whole thing you know let that fight go in this fighting i'm going in focus just like i was in the first fight was I was focused but this item will be more focus i'm gonna use my legs use my boxing skills not our boxing you know Glenda's old warrior he's not going to change he's gonna you know what you see is what you get he's not bringing anything different so but Chad like you said he's working progress and he's learning every day you know the last fight with Glen Johnson you know abroad Chad to another level norwood that he can hang in there with those guys and Glen is another year another two years old it and two years slower and why my guy is a two years stronger at two two more years experience wise you know the I know you don't want to look beyond this fight but there's a lot of good stuff out there for you the you know Showtime has their super sick super middleweight tournament those guys are out there there's Pavlik out there and in Williams and and Bernard Hopkins and perhaps a Roy Jones I mean I think you're in a really good position right now yeah i mean i think im gonna excellent position to you know like you said I don't know the past Glen Johnson you know although I know what's gonna happen on november seventh i'm gonna win you know I don't nobody goes in and looked at knockout come on John Cena I know I'm gonna outbox um use my legs my hand speed you know and then after that you know whatever if you'll bring say tell you know I'll be ready for it 28 and 0 17 Kos I still think he's a work in progress I think I still think he can improve as a fighter what are you doing to make him improve ouu hundred wasn't right because every time he second to the gym you know we work on different situations and he's improving every day I mean we have a great time in the gym working showing him to hit and not get hit because that's the name of the game and showed him balance how to sit down on his punches and get his uh his balance correct because everything starts with balance once we get the balance together everything else is natural I'm sort of old-school you got an old skool trainer and Eddie who you know the the light heavyweight division now right now I think you can't really move up to heavyweight those guys are too big light hit cruiserweight perhaps but I think no you can go up to heavyweight okay well what we'll get to that then but I just think being a dominant light heavyweight is something that's pretty damn important yeah yeah i mean i would definitely me dominate for the for the next couple years at the division you know either good whether i go up or go down you know it doesn't matter any division i mean i want to be dominating you know i'm saying so you know if I go down where I go up cruiserweight heavyweight doesn't matter you know I want to be down a time let me continue to work hard like I've been doing for the last four or five years you know and just know continue to be successful or you can kind of watch and see how uh how David hey does against value of to get it but you stopped me there for a moment are you trying to it's hard to stop Smitty isn't it why do you think that you could go up in and challenge heavy weights today because they're so big yeah yeah they are so big but they're also so slow you know I watched the UM the Klitschko in the home was otherwise def fight you know there's slow every older that means I mean the god this Sloan not taking nothing with Muriel there it was he's a great fighter ii the big puncher you know and I mean he fought a hell of a fight I mean he was just I felt he was over matching oversized so I mean it was pretty much easy for the critical to the maneuver around him and use his size and you know his arm reaching knowing and do it everyone with him so I mean heavyweights are slow as a lot of money aren't even in shape show me I think that I cope with the muscle on I'm i got the height I got the reach though I mean heavyweights not as indefinite not in a question maybe I didn't consider the height because I've never had that luxury of having the the height where do you think you rank in the other pound-for-pound status right now prime account status I mean what they got should be on this definitely I mean I'm not gonna say why I should be a but I definitely think I should be on others and a prediction for your fight with the road warrior Glen Johnson what's going to happen so have him chad dawson total domination every still I want everyone everybody erase the memory of the first fight you know this feeling totally Domino I'm in shape I mean I feel like there's nothing he could do to stop me you know he needs a straight he only has one sky is gonna come straight forward you know he's not gonna back oh so that's why we have to use my boxing skills on my leg you know I'm prepared to do that best of luck thank you I appreciate it

        "transcript": "we're here with running backs Trey Watson Lonnie pal and and Vick and wor how you guys doing doing great great so uh you guys have come off a a tough break of uh working out hard Swagger games and everything else you got going on how do you feel like you're physically prepared coming into spring practice um I feel like Dam does a great job with the straight conditioning program getting us ready to come out here and practice 11 100% every play so the offseason was really good so far and uh I mean we had a lot of competition a lot of excitement so it wasn't too much work for us it was a lot of fun most definitely I feel like offseason was our key I mean I put on 15 lbs myself strength went to a whole another level so I mean it was a great opportunity for us to get better and compete with the team and everybody wants it so we're going to see what happens this spring sort of like uh Trey here I put on on a little bit of weight put on 20 lbs St in here and I feel like Daman is doing a great job um especially with us in the weight room and especially getting us ready for conditioning so that we're in games we not tired so I it's going to take a major toll on us how we doing so um Trey and and Vic you guys have have had a year in the system now how do you feel like it's different coming into the spring practice after after going through a full season man it it's just crazy how to feel the difference from from our first practice in the ball to now it's like having experience it's real like it's it's an amazing thing because coming out here like I know what to expect you know I can have more fun you know my first day at Spring ball was a lot more fun than my fall fall cam everything was like flying around you know unsure about a lot of things but uh now it's just it's like second nature we've been doing it so long and uh I think the experience has really helped us oh yeah absolutely I mean doing this and getting these reps is it's a great opportunity for us to be able to learn the tempo of the game so I mean after this year we played I feel like nothing can stop us at this point but us it's coming easy to us now so I mean it's a cool thing we got young Lonnie right here he's getting a good feel for it too he's picking it up real fast so I mean it's going to be real cool we going to have a great competition in this back field this year so Lonnie you uh came in as an early entrance and uh you've had a a few months to work out with a team get adjusted on on campus and and now you're in practice what's it like being on the field now taking the next step it's it's very fast it's like I have to keep up all you left behind because it's not high school no more so I got to realize that and I got to step up to a level competition so we saw you guys um working real hard in some of the videos that have been released with the strength and conditioning program and we did a feature on it the other day too can you talk a little bit about the Swagger games and what that means as far as uh maybe a little explanation of how it works and and what it means as far as building camaraderie amongst the teammates and all I mean the Swagger the swager games basically represent what our team is it's a you know we're all a team from offense to defense but it's comprised of several units offense defense special teams and what the S Swagger game does is gives us an opportunity throughout the offseason to compete like we're in the football season so it's it's a lot of fun I mean it's not always just about the on the field stuff I mean academics plays a big part into it so it really teach us to be accountable for ourselves be accountable for our team and with school and football so I mean I think it's a great thing for our program s games is real cool I mean dudes compete every day you go against somebody they line you up and you go at it all Friday so I mean it's a great opportunity for you to get to somebody that's on your around your level around your speed and strength and everything and compete to be better than that guy next guy and it pushes us to be the best we can be and what's the academic element of it too oh yeah academics is like everything honestly I mean I we come out and we compete but at the end of the day the most points comes from academics so I mean it it is what it is I mean it's a great competition it's a great experience but at the end of the day we got to handle our business in classroom cuz that's what matters first that's what we got here for so we got to handle our business any of you guys have bragging rights with your team in in the games anybody in the lead so far okay all right but I got the most points probably out of anybody on this out of anybody on the team so I would say he has a most points because of some of the academic but as far as points out here has yet to beat me in the 15 yard Sprint I just keep it like that so the way we do it is like you draft players you get captains and then you draft players and everybody doubted me I went first round baby I went round it's great competition between us always it's going to be like that but uh it's been fun it's been fun oh yeah can't wait for this spring can we talk a little numbers too uh what you measured out at height weight and maybe bench and 40 okay uh I measur out 61 226 um vered at 38.5 I ran uh 4.59 fast time was 4.55 but you know we won't argue with the coaches on that one and uh I benched uh 325 and squatted 500 okay so when I got measured in weight in I was 510 and I was 221 lb and then my vertical is 352 then I ran a 40 at a um a 462 and uh my bench press was 275 I believe and then I squatted 475 so I'm still working to be the best that I can be okay and then I weighed in at uh 197 my height was 5'9 and a half but I'm definitely 510 don't let it for you and then I uh I squaded 435 bench 300 and then I ran a 454 great so uh what are your your thoughts coming into the rest of spring practice and heading into this season is the confidence level pretty high oh yeah mostely lot I feel like it's a lot higher than last year I think I'm getting back to that high school feeli like loving the game more than you know feel like it's work or you know trying to learn it's you know the learning process you know we still learn every day but the bulk of it you know we we got the training wheels off and now it's time you know ride and I keep getting better every day so it's it's a lot funner a lot easier kind of feel like I'm really getting into the swinging things like I've been here for a while now it's just the the whole speed element that I'm catching up with everything else I'm pretty much caught up oh yeah most definitely I mean every day we got to come out here and compete cuz you got to do every rep like it's your last rep cuz you never know next man is working just as hard as you and once and just as bad as you yeah exactly so you definitely got to push yourself to the Limit as far as you can go because at the end of the day you don't want to get left behind we're looking forward to watching you guys the rest to regardless I mean regardless of the fact I mean there's always going to be a competition between us and the running backs up from Las to kaani Juju all of us um but at the end of the day we as a group want to be the best running backs in the country exactly and mo a lead as as our team as an example with our team we're going to have competition within us but at the end of the day I mean we be the best group of backs there is we to talk about you know what is it like to be a cal running back you know bring that Swagger back to this team rbu baby we're looking forward to seeing you guys the rest of Spring ball and uh looking forward to a successful season coming up this next year oh yeah no doubt"

        "transcript": "hey guys what is up it's the man the myth the legend quad mft here bringing you an insane 111 kill death ratio gameplay on the map Yemen in groundw Kill confirm playing fully solo using this absolutely amazing scorpion Evo submachine gun and today I thought I'd talk about something a little bit different today we're going to be talking about how I got this insane gameplay and another reason why I got this insane gameplay that we're going to be addressing is map awareness now a lot of people don't know that this has to do with how many good game plays you can get and I really think it's probably one of the most vital things that you have to do to be able to get insane game plays like this so you need map awareness and if you guys don't know what map awareness is I'm going to tell you guys right here you can see in this gameplay I'm running around with the submachine gun and the score streaks that I'm using for today are the orbital vset the K9 unit and the Swarm which also have to do with map awareness if you believe me so you don't really want to go towards the middle because in the middle if you just run out and you think you can outgun everybody with an SMG knowing you you probably can I'm just taking the odds I can't do that and you'll probably get shot off like a little baby buffalo so definitely don't go out and try that and so the thing that has to do with my score streaks the reason I did so well again was because I was able to shoot enemies with my gun the whole game I didn't have to control one kill streak like the lame old load star the Vall warship I was able to run around run and Gun and kill all the enemies I possibly could because the K9 unit controls itself so does the orbital vsat and so does the Swarm so they work together really well and that's really how is a able to do so well I was having a ton of fun this game I hope you guys are having a ton of fun watching me and I hope you guys can see that I'm really really aware what's going on when I see an enemy four enemies coming at me I probably won't just go head on and try and outgun all of them because probably I don't have the best gun skill I really don't I personally don't think I do I think one of the things the reason why I do so well why I can do consistently so well is because I use tactics to my advantage I'm a really tactical person I think about everything where I'm going what I'm doing what type of gun I have what the enemies are like I kind of learn what the enemies do what kind of guns the enemies use what the score streaks they're running just overall how they play and I can basically counter that and being able to counter the enemy strong point is something that really works in real life too if somebody's making fun of you you can probably counter their strong point maybe they're making fun of your hair or something you can make fun of them of their shoulders I don't know guys I'm just saying something you can counter that in real life you can also counter anything in Call of Duty there basically countered to everything besides the orbital V set I mean there is The Counter UAV but not many people run The Counter UAV it's good and all but I really prefer the orbital vat the orbital vat's absolutely insane it tells me where every single one of the enemies are at that's a huge Advantage so definitely definitely definitely definitely have a lot of map awareness stay aware keep your eyes open try and have a faster reaction time and if you guys aren't really too good with my gun or your gun I don't know I don't want to be talking about my gun but just overall with a gun you definitely need to go out and try combat training because when you're trying combat training you have a lot of different enemies you can be able to shoot out when you shoot out a lot of different different enemies trust me it will get your aim on eventually it helps helps you a ton so I'm just here to thank you guys for watching this video I really hope you can go out and use a ton of the cool tips that I taught you guys little tips and tricks here and there they definitely help me get a lot of these game plays definitely for my channel right there I pick up the nuclear which means I just got an insane 30 gun streak in my opinion something really hard to get but definitely go out use all these different tips and tricks hopefully you'll be able to pull off some amazing game plays maybe you'll be able to pull off your first 100 plus maybe your first 50 kill game maybe your first 50 kill TDM maybe you're not even playing Call of Duty and you just like watching my videos because of me I don't know guys anymore my channel is a little bit confusing but I hope you guys enjoyed this video remember to leave a like

        "transcript": "okay this video is to give you an up-close look at this early beta Meyer Black Forest cuckoo clock this beautiful clock was made by Theodore Kennard in fur Trog in Germany in the very early 1860s about 1860 and Theodore Keter was one of johann baptist beha the main competition and he made clocks of the highest quality today many clocks made by the cutters are actually miss attributed to the D ha firm and to find a cuckoo clock from this period in a betta Meier case is very rare and they're very collectible this clock predates the carving that is traditionally associated with the Black Forest cuckoo clock today it also predates the use of the pine cone weight and also the carved bone hand so this is a great example of an early cuckoo clock that went from the early shield style to the case and then further developments the cuckoo evolved into a cuckoo clock that most people relate today you see it has a nice front door and behind the door it has a dark almost black finish and it retains its original stenciling of flowers and other simple motifs it has its original porcelain columns with its original guilting you see the enamel dial is in beautiful condition the little cuckoo bird comes out of the top simple pediment top you can see he's an original very early cuckoo bird automated in his beak but he has fixed wings which is correct for ku klux era the case is not perfect and it's a beautiful fruit wood color case it does have a couple little bangs here and there but all in all it's in beautiful condition especially for its age most the cuckoo clocks made during this period had not survived hey we want to set it off so you can hear it in action you can see it's running and it is ready to enjoy the movement was dismantled it's been recently serviced the bellow tops have trapezoidal bellows with leather and this is a clock that we're actually letting go out of our collection it's been listed on eBay and that auction actually ends tomorrow we're kind of late in getting this video together but we wanted to get this on here so people can actually see a video the clock and up close and in person other than just just the photos for more information on rare and unusual black forest clocks you could check out our website which is black forest clocks org we also have a new book which extensively covers the black forest clock industry including the cuckoo clock showing many examples of early be temeyer cuckoos like this and that book is titled rare and unusual black forest clocks and an up-close look at that book with sample pages in the table of contents as well as an option to purchase your own copy is available on our website also again black forest clocks org"
