James with those shoulder problems but he's really not [Music] the double-team [Music] [Applause] 415 fires posting up [Music] [Music] yes [Music] five seconds [Music] it's got not wanting to let burn funding face journal one comes out but overruns the play leaving another wide open lane for Michael to get in there draw the defense and get the easy one for Bill Bennington so Michael Jordan setting up Phil Whittington to conclude matters here the birth [Music] Takako 80 115 babies to get back in there and SWAT it out however the goals here we capture the ball [Music] public cuts it down a war in overtime you got one under your belt how did you feel well you see my time you do a bit off today I mean I was just trying to get my rhythm back in I don't know if it was a good game for me to come back Reggie seem very energized and it's my first game back yeah I know it's not gonna happen to one game it's going to take a little bit did I get my daughter back but hey I'm back that's all that matters does it concern you over there playoff so close that you will get your timing back in time perfect timing I'm not worried about that I think a couple games like to have my timing back but this is not a playoff game it is not you know I know we want to win but for me I really got to take my time and try to work my way back in let's clear up a few things that have come up but they're talking about you when you coming back you had some assurances that Scottie Pippen was going to be here and Vijay Armstrong is that anything today I'm going back to the lovely again I'm not back here for extra money I'm not back here you know I was hoping and I'm still hoping that Scottie Pippen and BJ and kill all those guys would be back and so it's not my place to make those decisions but yo quite simply I I hope everything works out you know put all three those guys but you know I'm back for the love of the game and what about the fact that you had something that you didn't have to go to practice or come to Quogue no practice I need to practice I cannot skip practice I needed today's really soaking I need to get back into practice last question Michael you left at your feet if you don't come back and lead this team to a championship do you worry that this might have something messed up your mistake a bit no I mean you're not expected to win every time but I'm back here to try to help my team win and uh you know we certainly got a good opportunity what was great to have you back we'll see you next week all right thanks Michael"

        "transcript": "uh hello everyone uh today's project is I'm going to be adding this extra brake light called the stopper on my motorcycle uh looks like a pretty Universal thing pretty much fit on most bikes depending on uh how you have your plate on but uh pretty easy instructions uh I got it locally for about 25 bucks I was surprised I could only find it at one shop uh anyway this is it um see the way they have it pictured is they have it uh screwed into the bottom screw holes on the plate well they just don't quite line up accurately to be doing that on a plate so I used a uh spacer um I got a little piece of plastic I tried to use some metal but just wasn't having too much fun drilling it so I found some uh couple of plastic pieces so I can kind of lower it I think it was about uh almost 3/4 of an inch so that will be lined up and and it will be hold on a sec ah okay so it'll be sitting there at about at that angle um this is my old plate don't use it anymore and so went ahead and uh as you can see it's starting to take apart the tail on my R six uh taking the rear seat off I just couldn't quite get in there so I had to go ahead and take the uh driver's seat off uh then I went ahead and just took the whole upper tail piece off and then I even unscrewed this piece so what we're getting is the rear tail light and brake light is actually clamping in right there so got my voltmeter figure out which wires which and if I'm reading it right the black wires the negative the blue wires for the tail light always on and the yellow light will be for the uh brake light so and the rest of these lights uh these are the two turn signal lights as well as a license plate light uh my Fender Eliminator kit has the signals separate most Fender kits have the signals in here so if you've got an aftermarket kit and you've got more wires running in um there's these two wirers coming in right here the one that's got the connection point right here that's your tail light this other set of wires those are your signal lights so if you have a Eliminator kit with the turn signal in here uh that's how you know the difference so now that I got it all apart uh I'm actually going to uh kind of Connect into this area so that way if I screw up I could always replace this part where this one goes way down in the body don't want to mess with that so that's the setup and we'll see how it goes okay so the next step what I did was just a little utility knife I went ahead and cut um just a little bit out I didn't want to cut the wires and splice into it so I was just trying to uh cut and remove the insulation so that this wire I could just wrap around it so I'll go ahead try that and uh continue and see how it works okay everyone uh as you can see I got the um main harness pluged back in um I just removed a little bit of plastic from the Black black negative wire and the yellow which is the wire to the brake light and the blue light is or blue wire is for the tail light so I got it all hooked up uh ran into a little snag cuz as soon as I hooked it up everything went out my uh brake light went out no turn signals I lost my horn in my headlights well it turns out it's because they're all on the same fuse so where was the fuse it was if you remove this little p plastic piece uh unhook that and you see the green fuse that's the third one up now normally from the factory it was a uh I believe a 10 amp fuse for just the headlights now the previous owner upgraded the headlights to hid uh added these LED turn signals as well as the uh Fender Eliminator kit and they put in a 20 amp fuse well as soon as I hooked uh this extra brake light up it blew the fuse out so went and got a uh 30 amp fuse hooked it back in and everything's all good so here we go we'll turn the key on see the tail lights just went on and here's the front brake handle all right and here's the foot lever yeah okay so that's set up so got everything working electrically I'm going to get it all back together and show you how it looks okay everything's back together everything's all set you can kind of see see how it sits there right underneath so go ahead turn it on we got the tail light license play light going let's see how the brakes work oh yeah sweet pretty nifty that's it okay so if uh you got any questions uh how to put that on or uh any any trouble you've ran into uh like with all LED upgrades you just got to upgrade the fuse so that's all and uh let me know if you have any questions later"

        "transcript": "I didn't fot do it again I Didn't Do It swamp it was been a Silent Shot no reload that was terrible do it again all right what is going on YouTube my name is CB today I'm going showing you how to get out of the map on wmd on Black Ops 1 as you see right there I went into this corner on the side of the map threw a couple care packages down and waited for one to land on top of me to where it glitch me kind of inside the care package half in half out sometimes it works if it just lands somewhere on top of you then you're going to need another person right outside and right near you that way you can lunge and it will slide you right out of the map J radar and it will that's what a breach is on Black Ops 1 it's how you get out of most maps and then for this part you need at least four care packages five or six might work even better but it's hard timing for that so once you get care packages then you're going to [\u00a0__\u00a0] kills care package class obviously for care package breaching is to breach and run fast so I would suggest using the care package class if you're you're using my game mode get the care package class first so you can throw the care packages down jump on top make sure it works just throw it anywhere on this building as long as the care packages are in the exact same spot every time you should be fine so here we're just waiting for me to waiting for the care packages to land and then find a way to get on top of the very top one and then you're going to throw two more one or two more down and if you bounce it off this little bar right here as I did right there it went the wrong way so you got to back up a little bit and it will hit the bar and go right where you're prone that way it will land just like the others did so here I'm getting a couple more kills just in case those care packages Miss but I'm going to change my breach class so I can Sprint across like you'll see so here I think I speed it up in a second here cuz it's a little difficult if the care packages are stagger like this you just got to find a way up there's usually always a way up but if there's not you might have to throw more care packages down so once you do finally get up there and it is pretty hard to do with this class because you run so fast but right here I get it finally and you're going to need to do this without your tack that way you can you know go to the rest of the spot so as you see right there get the breach class you just Sprint across then you can tack it down now that could be a spot you could go from right there but we're going to get a little bit higher on this wall right beside me so here's one of the spots where you suicide so you're going to need a whole bunch more care packages if you play it easy and you want to use the care package class you probably need five or six care packages but if you use a breach class you might only need one or two so I think I just played it safe I threw as many down as I could just to show you guys what it looks like this is my first time doing this spot and the second shot you saw before this commentary was from naive Genie he'll put his link to I'll put a link to his channel in the description he's the one who actually showed me how to do this and so I used this shot it was a good shot too so he'll be in the description so as you keep moving along the care packages what I'm doing is double tapping X cuz I have Hardline Pro trying to get a supply or um get an ammo crate that way I can regain my uh what is it called sorry so I can regain my tactical Insertion that way when I get to the spot I won't have to kill myself and run all the way back so I'm just going to keep double tapping next once I get one and then when I finally do get a ammo crate then I just pick it up and I'll have a tactical Insertion so once you get about this far this white area right in front of me you solid so you just walk right on it and you're good to go and then there are if you look at the ground some of the parts are color a little like shaded a little different and that's how you can tell if it's a drop off or if you just go prone and you get blocked or if you fall off then it's a fall off mark so once you appear you're going need to go back the opposite way just on the higher ledge so there's another example of me falling through the map gas so it took me it took me like seven care packages if you do it with the care package class in your normal speed but I couldn't get it we were running out of time and kills so I took a huge risk which I would not suggest but if you think you have it then go for it so right here I'm just showing you what it looks like if you're a normal and how many care packages it takes to do this is so it's about five or six right there I'd say so here I think uh this care package missed I think I can make it and I did not so you need to get extremely close to that wall right there otherwise it's not going to work so here's where I took the big risk I have the breach class on and I just went for the jump actually that wasn't it that was me making sure I could do it this is me doing it see how I have my tack I was actually so scared when I did this cuz I didn't want to fall off it would have been a hour and a half it worth of time wasted I got my so once you're up here here's the trick shot spot and you can go for a suicide like that if you have lightweight on or you can just go for a normal shot like you saw in the beginning of the video so that's about it for this spot if you guys want to suggest anything before Advanced Warfare comes out leave it in the comment section below other than that I'll see you guys later peace shout out to Cameron muted damn it better give my [\u00a0__\u00a0] Channel a sh D all right guys thanks for watching if you haven't followed us on Twitter already go do that the link will be in the description below and I know we haven't uploaded in about a week but we've been really busy and school and stuff so we're trying to get stuff out before vent Warfare so our last episod was a unique hot challenge is you if you haven't seen it go check it out and that's it thanks

        "transcript": "okay in this tutorial I'm going to show you how to make a black and white image retain some colors in it um you you see this technique used a lot these days and it's kind of an interesting technique so I'm going to just get into it here in your layers you know obviously first you pick out an image and then in your layers you uh unlock this background layer I always like to make a copy of it okay and we'll call this layer black and White color okay and then the next thing that you want to do is make it black and white so there's a few different ways to do this the way that I'm going to do it is um go into my uh my adjustment layers and you'll click right here to go into your adjustment layers and you'll go into channel mixer and you'll click on monochrome right here and the next thing as you'll see that sets up your adjustment layer right here and you'll want to click on this as being your investment layer and then all you'll do is um go in and you can either brush out the areas that you want to be left in color or you can use a marquee tool and delete the areas that you want to be in color so um you know use a brush just to show you that you can brush them out and I'll make it the brush black so it will erase or you can use white on the eraser and it'll do the same thing and you can see that it's bringing the color back into there but the easiest way to do it on an object like this stop sign would just be to take my grammatic um lasso tool and just draw around the edge here a little quicker okay then you have your selection then you go ahead and just you can press delete or backspace and it'll just erase that area in your image and then what you'll have is you'll have your uh your image that's mostly black and white but you as you can see you've added the color back in by uh releasing that part of the Mask so as you can see this is what you have at the end here um this is what we started with nice beautiful colorful image and then this is what we ended with it's mostly in black and white but you still have your stop sign or you know whatever you whatever image you choose um okay I hope that was helpful thank you very much for watching please watch the rest of my videos and subscribe to my channel thank you very much"

        "transcript": "hey what's up guys Betty here and welcome to another Call of Duty Black Ops 3 video over the past few days I've been uploading tons of Black Ops 3 gameplay to my channel for you guys so make sure you go check out all those videos once you finish watching this one and also if you haven't already hit that subscribe button I'm going to be having tons of Black Ops 3 gameplay on my channel over the next few weeks in the buildup to the beta which I cannot wait for but if you didn't already know over E3 I got the opportunity to play and capture Black Ops 3 but anyway I now really want to get on to what I want to be talking about in this video which are the SMGs that are going to be available for you guys to use in Call of Duty Black Ops 3 especially when the beta drops in August which I cannot wait for but in the game playay you guys are watching I'm using the Cuda SMG first and then later on I start using the VMP which are the two SMGs I personally use the most sadly didn't get enough play time on the other two which is a real real shame only have 3 hours to capture everything and I was like I must get gameplay from every single weapon but the Cuda in my opinion is very like the MP5K from Black Ops 1 it's got a really nice iron sight really nice steady rate of fire it didn't have much recoil and it out of the SMGs that I used it was the one that was most effective over a longer range cuz in previous Call of Duties and everything SMGs can seem to kind of operate at all distances especially in like kind of the Black Ops series when you start thinking back to like the vector the MP7 and all that stuff that you saw people getting game plays with all the time and it was like okay yeah there's picking people across the map and you'll see later on in the video actually when I'm using the VMP I cannot kill people across range at all um the Cuda was a little bit more effective at that I was able to kind of pick people off to medium range the VMP close range it was absolutely dominant and that's kind of what I love about SMGs cuz everything in previous Call of Duties is like what's going to be the most um dominant weapon type is it going to be assault rifles is it going to be SMGs uh but SMGs kind of operate how SMGs should operate in this game they they allow you to get in people's face and if you're in someone's face you're going to win the gunfight the hitfire is AB absolutely insane especially if you're using the Las side attachment and I just can't get over that ruin uh like ruined specialist ability it just feels so awesome especially I can see people getting like some insane feeds with that especially when people are capturing Flags it's like okay yeah I'm just going to kind of shove my spikes into the ground um that's actually one thing I am really looking forward to getting used to is actually playing uh with more of the specialist and seeing which is going to be the dominant specialist cuz I remember a load of people were freaking out about that glitch specialist uh which allowed someone to teleport when when it first got announced but people aren't freaking out so much ruin though is just like Destiny fist of Havoc it's absolutely insane but anyway let's get back onto the SMGs um I was always running quick draw it's one of those things I always have to run on any gun these days um is cuz Quick Draw we a gun without Quick Draw is just bit like H do I really want to be using it and I'd always like kind of throw on grip and then the long barrel attachment which I always forget the name of but those were kind of the the kind of attachments I was always running didn't see the need to run Red Dot site on the uh Cuda cuz the sight's beautiful it's just that kind of like perfect thing but now we're getting on to the VMP and you guys will see what I mean up close it's absolutely insane you'll just tear someone's shreds in a few seconds but at a point right I was like what I'm burst firing I'm taking my time like here this were two people just pow pow they drop really quickly but when it gets a range it just becomes awful and it's why I'm kind of I always lean to the assault rifle players if you guys are following me for a long per period of time uh whether it was when I was playing competitive or whether it was when I was doing puing I always lean towards assault rifles just cuz I found them the most effective for me and if you throw in a stock attachment as well they seem good at close range as well especially if you're aiming for the top part of the body and if you saw the Shiva if you haven't seen that video already it's just like a one shot kill To The Head And there we go like bur firing some guy on the floor definitely head shot he just doesn't die and I die but I had absolutely tons of fun using the SMGs I'm going to be bringing you guys more SMG gameplay as well later on during the week cuz uh cuz I got a couple I got a small bit from one of the other SMGs I've forgotten the name name of it but I've got a load of gameplay as well and also guys go check out the rest of my Black Ops 3 gameplay and bringing it out daily for you guys um and let me know what you think in the comments as well what are you thinking about Black Ops 3 so far what do you think um what are you hoping they change what are you thinking they add because remember this is the alpha of the game there's going to be tons of changes this is the earliest they've allowed us to play multiplayer since I can remember Call of Duty since I've been playing I think the earliest last time was World at War which was like 8 years ago but thank you guys so much for watching make sure to subscribe if you haven't already and if you enjoyed the video smash that thumbs up button it's always really appreciated and I will see you guys next time bye"

        "transcript": "[Music] so hey there pixel enemy revive my name is Zant and today I want to talk about map design before we begin I want to apologize for the noark canals gameplay but as much as you guys have probably seen it on the various channels I think it's appropriate for my discussion one of the key features of any multiplayer game is of course the maps and one of the problems people have with Battlefield 3 is the map design and I've always been curious as to why especially in TDM no Shar canals and car Island are essentially all you see as someone who wants to design video games rather than just play them I have to think about more than just strategies on how I can win a particular gunfight I have to look at inconsistencies in Battlefield 3's map design and there are certainly inconsistencies and figure out exactly why those in inconsistencies exist and if they're purposeful or if they're errors in design when I say inconsistency I'm talking primarily about the speed of gameplay when you talk about Maps like no Shar canals or car Island TDM those are generally faster quicker killing games and then compare these with vehicle heavy Conquest Maps like Firestorm or Caspian or strike at caran or Gulf of in particular these maps are so large that even with 64 players battles are generally few and far between and so there's a lot of downtime a lot of walking around not doing much of anything even TDM on the big Maps can become boring and well tedious at times so the question I have to answer is quite simple why and I think the answer lies in two main factors one of which is obvious because of the topic I'm talking about map design but I also think it comes from the weapon balancing that dice has tried to implement with Battlefield 3 another topic of some controversy dice decided that they wanted to up the base damage of all weapons thus making them kill faster this wouldn't be so much of a problem the hit detection was as piss poor as say battlefield b Company 2 or Battlefield 2 though I never actually played that game I've heard that detection itself is bad and while the hit detection in Battlefield 3 isn't great it's better than it was in Bad Company 2 for the most part and so deaths happen quicker and with more frequency for example most assault rifles do 25 damage at minimum range and 17 at maximum range and because the rate of fires are fairly quick in most cases death is usually less than a quarter of a second this of course doesn't factor in the G3 any shotguns sniper rifles or other exceptions to the rule couple this increased damage model with some smaller tighter Maps like Metro Ro or bizaar or car Island TDM and you have you know instad deaths as far as the player is concerned and couple that with sometimes shoty hit notification and you just sort of die at random intervals that have no good explanation the question then becomes this is the case why aren't the huge Maps if not as fast but faster than they feel when you're playing and I think it has to come down to troop concentration when you go back to Bad Company to and you look at what people consider to be the best maps regardless of their actual quality and you look at the way they're laid out you see that the choke points aren't actually choke points but rather concentrations of high priority targets so for example on Val perzo though there are long distances that the Infantry needs to run to get certain places they're never running so far that the game slows down there's never a lack of action in other words you can look at the iconic Conquest map from bc2 Eric Harbor well there were places in that map where you could potentially not see anything for a good amount of time again it was never nearly as drastic as something like Conquest even regular Conquest on operation Firestorm and the argument exists that that's mainly because operation Firestorm is a vehicle map it's made ostensibly for Conquest large when you've got five helicopters in the air three Jets trying to kill the helicopters the helicopters trying to kill the Jets the tanks on the ground trying to kill the helicopters and the Jets to get those sick Montage Clips infantry on the ground going holy crap I'm going to die and then everything is just sort of chaos as far as the vehicles are concerned whereas there were no vehicles except for the the Infantry moving vehicles on Erica Harbor and those had no combat Effectiveness in the grand scheme of things what hampers Battlefield 3 the most as far as map design is concerned is dice's desire to keep every map in every game mode a noble effort to be sure and almost required considering the fact that there are only nine base Battlefield 3 maps but when your map must accommodate TDM Squad Deathmatch Rush conquest and occasionally Conquest large there are sacrifices you need to make in the design process to make sure that the balance is retained across all modes and unfortunately this leads to Battlefield 3's almost signature design philosophy we need more choke points and because of the prevalence of bipods and extended m lmgs a higher damage model slightly better hit detection depending on your connection and you have what essentially amounts to grind fests in a lot of the game modes so do I think that Battlefield 3 would be 10 times better with 10 times better Maps no it would probably be about five times better with 10 times better Maps there are other issues dice has to work out first many of which have been discussed in Greater detail and better by better commentators than myself but for right now I'm just going to leave it at that that hope you guys enjoyed the video and I'll catch you next time"

        "transcript": "yo what is going on ladies and gentlemen my name is Bash before I jump into this commentary my voice may sound a little different may sound a little off I did lose it earlier today I went to a concert I saw Jay-Z and Kanye West in their was of Throne concert I went crazy when ham it was a good night I lost my voice so obviously must have been a crazy night but I wanted to do a commentary for you guys nonetheless so here I am to my Americans Happy Thanksgiving Happy Black Friday I don't think you really celebrate Black Friday but you know what I'm saying go shopping save some money do what you do I hope you're enjoying yourselves I hope you're spending time with your family and friends I hope you're playing a lot of Modern Warfare 3 for all the students who got to come back home and chill hope you're having a good time but as you can see right now in this game I am playing kill confirmed with some friends of mine and I've said it before kill confirmed is one of my favorite game types when the game was announced and kill confirmed was first announced I thought it was a fad I didn't buy it I wasn't buying into it I didn't think kill confirmed I didn't think a new game type would actually be that fun to play I didn't think anyone would be jumping on to it um you know I figured the only game types people would keep playing would be TDM domination ground war free-for-all Search and Destroy the regulars just those ones really that are always full and always pack to people but kill confirm seems to you know what I'm saying be making a name for itself seems to have a pretty strong fan base seems to have a lot of people playing it and the fact that it does give you the best chance to really prestige quickly and get a lot of XP get the most XP that you possibly can as quickly as you can I know that's what Ernest Le to get to 10 use to get to 10th Prestige as fast as he did um I guess that helps it I guess that's why a lot of people are in it but it's really fun I mean it's really just TDM and adds a whole new kind of a whole new angle to it there's a whole new objective to the game at the end of the day killing people slaying is the objective but there's a little twist to it so it's fun it's cool I like it I have fun with it and you guys can see that you'll probably be seeing a lot of kill confirmed on my channel just like you're probably going to see a lot of ACR I am going to try and switch that up for you guys I apologize for the ACR gameplay again but I am using that silenced ACR I love that gun but anyways man now that the game has been out for a while a lot of you guys have been playing it you guys have been getting used to it getting the hang of it I really am starting to feel comfortable with where I'm at in this game I'm starting to really wrap my head around it all took me quite a while um when Black Ops was coming to a close when it was coming to and I was confident with my Call of Duty skill like I thought I was the man I thought I was good I thought I could go go to work I thought I was going to just put Modern Warfare 3 in and go to work on people that was definitely not the case I had a little bit of a rough time there there are some slight differences between Modern Warfare 3 and Black Ops small differences that make big big changes to the way you have to play the game the way you have to approach the game in Black Ops you can enter a gun fight enter a situation um you know what I'm saying a little bit of an exchange with an enemy and you could realize that this really isn't the place you want to be and you could probably run away there were a lot of instances where you could come into a situation exchange fire and be like you know what this ain't for me and run away and still get away safe even after taking a couple of shots in Modern Warfare 3 when you run into an enemy and you're in a bad position you're probably going to die you will die so you know what I'm saying there's less risk that you can take in Modern Warfare 3 than you can than you could have in Black Ops I felt like I could run around in Black Ops just rely on my my reflexes half the time I would you know what I'm saying 90% of the time I could just drop shot and and win a gunfight if if I was in a bad situation I could run away none of that happens in Modern Warfare 3 a couple shots you are dead you are gone so you know my advice to you guys all you guys are having a hard time playing this game all you guys who were beasts in Black Ops and are not beasting in Modern Warfare 3 take it a little slower make sure you're putting yourself in situations that you're G to come out on top because unlike Black Ops you can't run away from Bad situations you can't fall into a bad situation and get away from it safely you need to make sure that you're always in a good situation you got to minimize the number of times you get into a bad situation so you really got to raise your awareness of what's going on around you where enemies are going to come from you have to understand how the maps work you have to understand where players are going to be coming from where you're going to be encountering other players and set yourself up for for being in a better situation as Woody always says control the engagement but you really need to control the engagement in Modern Warfare 3 so take it slow uh walk when you're indoors walk in buildings when you're walking around corners and you know there are no teammates around that corner walk um use stalker Pro if you find yourself having a really hard time so you can aim down sight and still move at a pretty quick Pace um there are different ways that you can kind of slow down your gameplay but you need to slow it down you cannot go crazy um obviously I'm not saying don't rush there are a lot of people who can rush and are success F at it but if you are one of those people who find yourself in a bit of a slump take it easy man slow it down do not Camp I do not Advocate camping I don't think that's the way to the play you don't want to jump in a building hide in a corner and kill people cuz that never lasts you have to keep it moving people if people know where you are and they know where to expect you it's just that much easier for them to kill you you want to make sure you always have the advantage so make sure you're moving you know move slow take it easy don't run around when you die don't get you know don't get all riled up and just have to run back to where you die and try and get revenge that never ever works you always get [\u00a0__\u00a0] up so take your time take it slow um also there's this there's this thing called lag conversation that I've just kind of found out about and it's it's a crazy concept it's an amazing concept to me I didn't even know it existed I'll put a link in the description to a really informative video this dude does an amazing job of describing what it is but um it's something they implemented into the game to I guess help people they try to help people who have bad connections but what really ends up happening is people who have bad connections have such a great advantage over you that even though you feel like you know what I'm saying you engage in a gunfight you pop off three four shots you don't even see hit markers and you just drop you just die um I know that's happened to you guys happens to me all the freaking time but um go check out this dude's video learn a little bit more about it I'll talk about it more in another commentary proba probably show you guys some examples but you can figure it all out just by watching this dude's video it's amazing I'll put an annotation on the screen the link in the description but anyways I'm going to get out of here for now now I got to let my voice rest I talked way too much today um hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did give it a thumbs up as always you can follow me on Twitter and on Facebook twitter.com facebook.com LOL and I love you guys as always peace out"

        "transcript": "all right guys what's going on iris toxics and welcome to fifa 14 next gen career mode now i am going to go with a manager career mode if you want to see a my player then you know you can drop a comment we are going to take the 15 budget increase because of um i played fifa 14 career mode on the 360 i think that's how you do it but i am going to go one of my teams i do support i am going to go hibernian from scotland and if you watch my career mode last year or last before you've seen that i've done this to you as well we are going to go for a world class five minutes games might change that to six and we are going to call the stadium easter road i think and i spell it wrong to start off with and i need to change the s to a d now we do pick ivy lanes that's the most realistic one actually kind of looks like but as you can see here they want to get to around 32 off the cup which i think is a little bit stupid because we've been heads have been in the scottish company the past two years yes i'll leave it at that and um yeah so i caught myself denturing palms it so we've got our useless scouts i give you oh and then he helps you anyway but i'm setting them up i know you know the game gives you them you may as well use them um so once in scotland if you put them in scotland they get a little bust i think because they know what clearance around them and the whole global network thing is it's completely doesn't work it's stupid i don't like it just make it fifa 13 for fifa 15. so we're going to look for center attack in med and probably looks like dribbling pace you know and then we're going to look for yeah dribbler and then and i want to get them to the champions league and win it so this might be a long career mode if y'all stick by me well won the champions league i'll probably end it if i won the champions league because i'll be like two seasons of getting pumped so we need to win ever again and pick a good player so we are looking for a right back because the right backs like clancy i don't even know i can't remember but he's all right but we want to do one so i just seen here that the scouts have been done and that is the squad you know just changing the squad around as you can see here you know collins comings little young players probably will take him out because he's only 58 we are going to look for a new striker because even though we have a lot of strikers they're all basically i'll call this guy's useless in real life but we are going to look for a lot of persons a lot of heads fans well recognized as lee griffiths now i thought he would be cheapesh i know he's on he plays for wolves you know he's on 7 000 a week he's in a little you know he plays wolves as his legal ones and then we're going to look for right back we're going to look for vladimir krankov he's on loan so we could just loan him out you know use him and then we're going to look for adam campbell who is actually now on loan to sim marin but he's a good striker he's got you know decent pace um he will become a good shooter he starts off with like a 62 or something so you know he's actually like higher he's high rated next to my strikers who are like  like 25 and he's 18. maybe we are going to look for gail bramano i don't even know how to pronounce these african names from england oh um but i don't even know i don't think it is but whatever um i'm gonna loan him as well just you know i'm gonna do a castle fan so i know which players are good or not i was just like we have a lot of young decent talent there so may as well use them so our loan and transfer offer did get accepted so we now have vladimir rankov in our right back position for the season and newcastle did accept our offer for adam campbell so we do four years important first team player fight bonus pair goal and we submit the offer to them and they come back and say well you can take gail berman on loan but we've not think about about the adam campbell thing yet and wolverhampton reject my loan offer which is a little bit annoying also adam campbell comes back to me and declines my transfer request well contract and he was like i i don't think this will work out you know i don't think i like where i live that is bs you actually just need to change you're going to be like a first team player to like squad rotation they believe you but i did have to do my finances because of that loan offer i did accept it put my wage down too low so i had to boost it so i gave him a little bit more because i really want this striker i feel like he will become a star if i sign him and continue to play with him i will grow him to be something good and i could maybe make some money from him and i don't know if that just flashed back there because i'm sure i already done it so he's now on 4 000. maybe this was just an editing error because sony vegas was being done with this video i had to cut out the last like five minutes of it because of stuff like that but we are coming to the end of this episode as you can see adam campbell accepts our loan offer so our next game will be in the next video subscribe and i'll see you later"

        "transcript": "This video will cover the basics of recording\nwith the Canon Vixia cameras also known as the HV20 or HV40. Other than some minor differences,\nthese two models are virtually the same to operate. The contents of the Vixia kits are: the HV\n20 or 40 camera, a power supply with a connecting cord, a remote control, an RCA 3-way to mini\ncable, and a \"Menu Settings\" sheet. The first thing you need is power to the camera.\nYour two options are either battery powered or with the power supply. The battery is connected to the back of the\ncamera by lining up the metal contact plates on the battery to the metal pins on the camera.\nSlide UP until it CLICKS into place. To remove the battery, push the BATTERY RELEASE\nbutton on the bottom of the camera, and then slide the battery out. A fully charged battery should last you several\nhours of recording time. BUT you should always have a backup ready. . . And plug in whenever you can. Plug the power supply into the DC port on\nthe back of the camera, and use the connecting cable to plug into the wall. The next step is to insert the mini-DV tape. Slide the OPEN/EJECT button, while pulling\nthe door open. Insert the cassette with the sprockets facing in and the \"label side\"\nup. Close the compartment by pressing the inner door where it says \"PUSH,\" then\nclose the outer door when the compartment is all the way down. To record, push the little green button on\ntop of the camera and slide it towards CAMERA. Use either the viewfinder or the LCD panel\nto view your image. The panel can be swiveled in several positions\ndepending on your angle. Whatever you do, DO NOT FORCE IT! Check that the MODE switch, located on the\nside of the camera, is set to \"Auto.\" For this video, we will use only the AUTO functions. To start recording your footage, press the\nSTART/STOP button. You will see that the camera does a 10-second\ncountdown. It is best to let this countdown finish before your action begins. Also be\nsure to leave plenty of time AFTER your action ends. These steps are helpful for the post-production\nprocess. If you are shooting handheld video, it is\nbest to have a firm grip on the camera. Not just for safety reasons, but to also get the\nsteadiest shot possible. Put your right hand through the adjustable\nhandstrap and use the left hand for support. This also allows you to have easy access to\nthe record button, as well as the zoom toggle switch. The zoom toggle switch is pressure\nsensitive, to allow you to do slow or fast zoom shots. W means \"WIDE\" and T means \"TELEPHOTO.\" To get as steady a shot as possible, keep\nyour arms tucked-in close to the body, and whenever possible, keep\nthe camera zoomed out all the way. This camera has a 10-times optical zoom, which\nmeans when you zoom-in onto a subject, your body motion is amplified 10-times. This camera's steadyshot function has been turned on, and reduces SOME\nof the shake. If you are doing a handheld pan shot, start\nwith your body in an awkward position, and finish in a stable stance. First loosen the tilt knob of the tripod to\nallow you to tilt the handle up, and have access to the legs. Pull the legs out, so\nthat you can stand it firmly on the ground. On each leg, release the top locking mechanism,\nand pull out the legs individually. If you need more height, then you can do the\nsecond stage of the legs. You can release the column lock to extend\nit even further. If you still need more height, you'll have\nfind something even higher. To mount the camera on the tripod, you will\nneed the quick-release plate. Pull the release mechanism for the plate, and mount the plate\non the bottom of the camera by lining up the black pin with the smaller hole in the camera,\nand point the \"LENS\" notation towards the lens of the camera. Then screw the plate\nonto the camera. Angle the camera down on the head of the tripod,\nso that the front edge of the plate is under the overhang of the tripod. Press down, so that the locking mechanism springs into place. To pan the tripod, you can release the locking\nnut beneath the camera. To tilt, you release the locking nut on the side of the tripod.\nYou can leave the pan lock loose, but if you are stepping away from the camera or want\na static shot, be sure to tighten the tilt lock! When you are carrying the tripod, please carry\nit by one of the legs like this. DO NOT carry it by the handle, since it could\ndo damage to the tripod. For most cameras, the onboard microphone is\nnot the best option to collect good audio. You will need some more gear to get better\nsound: an external microphone, an XLR to 1/8-inch cable, and\nsome headphones. Connect the microphone to the audio cable,\nalso known as an XLR. Make sure the microphone clicks into place. For safety reasons, loop the other end of\nthe cable around the handle, and then plug the 1/8\" connector into the \"Mic\" input,\nlocated under a plastic covering on the right side of the camera. To monitor the audio, wrap your headphone\ncable around the handle and plug the 1/8\" connector into the \"AV/headphones\" jack. If you are hearing a buzzing noise, You just need to adjust a setting in the menu, to be able to monitor audio with your headphones. Use the \"MENU SETTINGS\" guide, included\nin the camera kit, to navigate you to this option. In order to make sure your tape and footage\nare okay, you will want to play back the tape. Set the camera into the PLAY mode and then\nuse the buttons on the front of the LCD panel to rewind the tape. Hit the play icon and\nsee if your footage is okay. Again, if you are hearing that buzzing noise, it is just\na setting in the menu. If you have any further questions, either\ncall Academic Tech Services at extension 5069 or stop by Seeley Mudd 110."

        "transcript": "let us now discuss about the sign convention\nfor mirror formula. as we have recently studied that. mirror formula. is given as 1 by u plus\n1 by v is equal to 1 by f. and here u. and v are object image distances from pole and\nf is the focal length of the mirror and we have. studied that here. (u v). and f. are\nused. with proper signs. according to the sign convention used. now there are verities\nof sign conventions, which are generally used in. various situations but here i am going\nto discuss about 2 sign conventions either of the 2 you can use. and here the sign convention.\nfor proper signs of u v and f we use is. sign convention 1. we use. by. taking. pole of\nmirror. as origin. and, we consider. direction of incident ray on mirror. as positive direction.\nlike say we are given with a mirror like this. and say this is the concave mirror. here we\nconsider the pole of mirror at origin and, the 2 sides there are 2 axis and if say an\nobject is placed here incident ray will be moving. from right to left. then in this situation\nthis direction we consider as plus x axis and this as minus x axis. and for the orientation\nof. object and image we can also consider plus y and minus y axis but these are rarely\nused. so this is the way how we used the sign convention in this situation as object is\nlocated on minus x axis. here we take u to be. negative. and as focus of this mirror\nis also on negative x axis here f will also be taken as negative. on substituting the\nvalues of u and f in the mirror formula whichever value of v we are getting correspondingly\nwe can locate the image if it is positive then. image is virtual and located behind\nthe mirror if it is negative then it is on the right side of mirror. this is the most\ncommon coordinate convention which is used in, verity of books. another. sign convention.\nwe use is the simple coordinate convention, this is based on direction of incident ray.\nand in the second sign convention again the first point remain same here. taking, pole\nof. mirror. as origin of the coordinate system. and beauty of this sign convention is you\ncan consider. any direction as. positive and, other. negative. and, in this situation you\nmust be very careful about the whole reflection process whichever direction you chose. that\nshould remain same like for example in the same situation here. if this is a mirror.\na general convention. which we take is from the origin on the righthand side we consider\nplus x axis on lefthand side it is, minus x axis. so no matter whether mirror is facing\ntoward right or facing toward left. in general you can always take right side as positive\nx axis and left side as negative x axis this is always be comfortable for use similarly\nfor y axis if require you can take these as plus y and minus y. so here if an object is\nplaced on the plus x axis here we take u as positive. and the focal length as focus point\nis, located on plus x axis here we can take f as positive. if the mirror would be facing\non the lefthand side we could have taken both u and f negative because, the points. o as\nwell as f, will lie on a negative x axis. so depending on various situation we can change\nthe direction also. and in these analysis of lectures for image formation by spherical\nmirrors i am going to use the second convention. where as if you wish by using convention 1\nyou can verify the results, and whichever convention you are comfortable you can use\nthat."

supposedly green phone supposed to be environmentally friendly there's a real focus on uh making sure the phone sort of follows the environmentally friendly theme featuring everything from Green packaging minimalist packaging sort of like we saw on Apple latest notebook entries um obviously the box that they sent here to us didn't really follow that but hopefully once we get inside okay so here we can see very minimalist packaging they kept it really small packing everything into a nice small environmentally friendly container Ed up less space like packing material all right so we've got a nice real small box here fits the phone everything the charger cables Etc um all right let's get this open here okay so everything opens up nice and small they've got it nice and compact inside and here we go we've got the phone uh the phone itself is a little bit over half an inch thick uh features a nice black streamlined design open it up here uh the phone itself is available with either a pink or a silver keyboard looks like we got the silver keyboard here uh as you can see really Slim and streamlined they they kept the lines nice and sexy probably the sexiest clam shell phone we've seen from Nokia in a long time uh the device itself features a uh about a 2 and 1/2 in display on the front on the inside and then on the outside we have a hidden in active uh external PM organic LED display uh the features also touch controls for the media player that are only going to be visible once you actually activate the phone okay um inside we also have uh we also have a slot for the micro SD card you can uh store up to 8 GB of media files on this device right here or that's the charger micro SD on the side as well as side controls and a 2 1/2 mm uh headphone jack on the back we've got a 2 megapixel camera featuring also a flash uh an external speaker phone on the front otherwise just nice Sleek sexy phone really Slim really lightweight nice to handle um let's go ahead and get it turned on here [Music] [Music] nice sleek and shiny we've got that silver gradient on the keyboard back there um everything looks really nice sort of a minimalist approach uh keep it simple which is nice here's that act uh hidden in active display you can see here um really nice keeps it keeps it sort of sleek and sexy without sort of being ostentatious um the phone itself uh features uh three uh 3G uh evdo Rev uh so you're going to get some nice fast browsing speeds when you use the mobile internet on this device also features GPS uh if you have a VZ Navigator uh option for your plan on Vari responsive uh menus here scrolling through the menus we're able to uh see it's pretty quick to respond to touch they kept it nice and simple uh menus are easy to navigate and understand go through um easy access to your contacts as well as messages straight from the shortcuts um buttons have a really nice feel to them there's they're real light a light press uh and you're able to feel a nice solid click on them but at the same time there's no real uh they're they're really smooth against the the back of the phone itself uh here we see the the sort of habitat mode that Verizon and noia put on the phone to go along with the green theme the habitat mode what it does is it uh displays your contacts chronologically uh in the order so once we put contacts on here and start making phone calls it'll display your contacts chronologically depending depend on when you last talk to them uh it'll even assign a sort of uh eco-friendly logo next to their uh next to their name you can thankfully change that to their real picture um the other aspects of the of the sort of green theme they include wild uh World Wildlife Foundation backgrounds and themes on the device and also it includes a uh energy uh green energy charger that uses 50% less uh energy than the energy standard app or char and let me pull that out here for you and show you here's the phone charger not literally green but rather just again 50% less energy than what's required for the energy star requirements we also have some recycling material in the Box as well looks like it's all made of recycled paper and whatnot postc consumer paper annuals tips shortcuts consumer information let's see what else do we got that appears to be about it my question is also you're supposed to be able to sync it to your computer itself to sync up the music and whatnot kind of wondering how they do that explain is a a2dp Bluetooth so stereo Bluetooth so you're able to use a stereo Bluetooth headset with it so if you want to listen to your music it um it'll Play Back MP3 WMA and unprotected AAC format one thing I forgot to mention with the with the charger itself it Fe when you plug the phone in and the battery becomes fully charged it features an unplugg message on the phone itself to tell you to unplug so you're not consuming up more energy without charging the actual phone uh other than that that's basically everything here we'll get we'll get a better Hands-On look after we get some time to play around with it uh the phone itself is $129 with a 2-year contract and a $50 uh instant rebate from Verizon Wireless and that's basically everything thanks for watching this has been an unboxing of the Nokia Intrigue on Verizon Wireless I hope you enjoyed it and we look forward to giving you more information about this phone in the upcoming future [Music]"

        "transcript": "hello and welcome to another video from dou in this video we're going to take a quick look at alternative to track fixing pins um as you can see here we have some uh Pico track fixing pin now Pico have very fine track fixing pens and uh even if you drill a hole uh through the sleepers um the Pico sleepers don't have the holes um but the Hornby and and um on do it says a setrack um but even through the uh holes you can see this happens quite frequently where the uh slightly thinner and finer um picco track fixing pins just bend Bend uh no matter how gently or how hard you tap them in so it can take quite a long amount of time to uh fix even short sections of track with the picco ones um here we have a Java and scenix uh track fixing pin and you can see it's a little bit thicker um but again it's prone to uh bending like this unless you're putting it into something like um uh you know MDF or or um you know some sort of lighter material but on this hardwood um plywood type stuff um it can bang quite frequently and both of these things including the Hornby ones um are about as thick as this I don't actually have a Hornby one on hand that's not in the the rail itself um but one of the biggest problems with the Hornby ones is that they're quite hard to get into the um the harder wood well they don't bend so um and unfortunately the Hornby ones are quite expensive um so two Alternatives um to the track fixing pens are actually um nails and Brads um that they use for um you know just hanging up pictures and that sort of thing so um both of these in the US are at number 19 uh I'm not quite sure what they'll be in Europe I'm not sure you can get the uh wire brats in Europe but you can get these um in the UK um either over on internet order um they're not too expensive um or if uh anybody really wants a ton of these they can drop me a message and maybe we can uh you know do some exchange or something like that but um basically here um we have the uh half by 19 uh wire um nails and um these are as you can see made of solid steel and they go in quite easily um the only problem with these even though the head is about the same size as the uh Javin scenix and the Hornby um it is uh kind of a silver color so assuming you're you're you know weathering your track and paying the sleepers and this isn't such a big deal but if you're not um that might be a a sticking point for you um the head is also quite noticeable um even after it's painted as it is with um the Hornby and the Javan scenix um nails so I prefer to use are these um wire BRS and um basically what they are is they're like a nail um they're about a little bit thinner um and they have a much smaller head but they go into the hardwood about as you know like a a warm knife through butter and I'm just going to demonstrate this to you now um here you can see the uh we have a wire Brad set up and we're just going to go ahead and uh and nail that in so I'm using a standard tack hammer and as you can see there that went in extremely easy uh this is a solid birch plywood um so it takes us a couple of seconds to nail that in and move on so to give you an idea this a length of Flex track um I can nail a length of Flex track in under a minute um with these um particular nails with the Pico ones it would take me closer to like 5 or 10 minutes and just cuz the number of ones I would actually Bend trying to get it into the hardwood so um the other advantage to these I'll show you the uh the box here from L is um these are dirt cheap um this whole container of uh wire BRS there probably a couple hundred in there um basically C cost under $2 so you can see there it's a 1.75 Oz and um there's there's quite a few in there and likewise I'll show you the um the nails and about the same deal I think these were a little bit more expensive maybe $1.90 or so so um definitely U what I'll be using going forward on the layout are these wire BRS they're Dirt Cheap um they look a lot better than in the in the track and um they'll save you a ton of time especially if you have a large layout so I hope you found the video useful and until next time"

        "transcript": "One year after the F-Type launch, we drive the closed F-Type Coupe. It begs the question: which one is prettier? I prefer the open car. Many disagree. Rightly so, it's just magnificent. Let's just enjoy it. Right. What. A. Rear! The spoiler's a bit smaller on this coupe, too. Also, this is the F-Type R, limited - yet - to the coupe. Its supercharged V8 has 550 ps. The chassis is more dynamic, too. 'Wow' sums this car up nicely. It's overwhelming. Brutal all over. Brutal in the design and the way it drives. Amazing! The V8 noise seems to be even more present, even in regular mode. The cameraman complains about losing his hearing. And he's used to it. It's almost embarrassing. Not everyone outside will like it. Noise aside, the engine's great. So much power, and instantly too. And it keeps on going. Instant power whenever you want. There's the well-known 8-speed ZF 'box. It's great, though a bit slow. It always responds well though, even in Normal mode. It works instantly with these nice metal flappy pedals, too. While some DCT's don't always respond as you would like. I prefer this. The steering's fine. Old-fashioned hydraulic set-up, so you feel everything. It's great to play with this car as it's very communicative. The ride is the relative weakpoint of this car. It's not bad though. It responds well but there's too much movement. The seat is a bit too high. When you push it there's a bit too much roll. It's no die-hard sports car. It's more of a very dynamic, brutal GT. It's just not as precise and razor-sharp as a 911, for instance. At the convertible launch, Jaguar stated it's not a Boxster or 911 rival. Now, they admit this car appeals to the same audience. But, the V6 S offers 911 performance for Boxster money. While the F-Type R offers Turbo S performance for 911 money. They didn't try to copy the 911, but made it their very own car. The Jaguar is more brutal, kind of like an AMG Mercedes. Design overkill and brutal power, coupled to good steering. You'd get a different audience than 911 buyers with that. So this is a great different choice. This offers so much fun. You don't have to drive it hard to feel it's great. It's fun at any speed. Cracking job. + Great design; Noise, power and spectacle - Much pricier than the V6 S; Not refined on the limit"

        "transcript": "Breitling source calm here and we're looking at a taqueria aqua racer caliber ass today this is one of tags one of many tag caliber ass watches the cal brass is very noticeable because of the two sort of semi circles that you'll see right here and they're used to indicate the the date as well and during normal operation and when you switch to chronograph mode they're used to indicate the 1/100 of a second timing that's kind of like the the specialty of this watch is that it can record um or the one hundredth of a second but also the same mechanism the same store the same same dowels sub dials are also allow you to set the perpetual calendar which while it only indicates the day the day of the month you actually set it based on the month and year so it actually is stored up to twenty two thousand nine nine which is kind of a cool feature there are two aqueous or caliber asses boshy there's several but there's two main sizes this is the larger 43 millimeter version there is a smaller regatta version that is a forty one millimeter not quite as nice the bezel isn't quite as as as handsome as this one and the the clasp is also slightly different this one has the higher end push-button clasp while the other one has the flip lock this pretty much has the same same design as most of the other tag aqua racer watches that you've seen that have this this sort of chronograph ring there with the unidirectional bezel on the outside um let's show you what the forty three looks like on the wrist give you an idea it's good size good chunky size covers most of the wrist good presents great blue color on this one let's talk a little bit about the movement interestingly the crown does absolutely nothing when you spin it at any time no matter what mode you're in the the spinning of the crown does absolutely nothing which would make you wonder why they allow the crown to spin to begin with but I'm not sure why but it does and it does absolutely nothing when you do it so in order to switch modes on this one on the aquas you just depress the crown once and all the all the hands are you set here not only does oom up so all the things reset switching back to time mode is ticking away and that sub dial down there is pointing at the number 4 because it's the 4th and push it again to switch to craft mode and to start the cord off mode you always use the top pusher and in this case it's the same so it's timing by seconds there and the hour and the minute and also time the hour and minutes for the chronograph so it's sort of switches between chronograph mode and time mode as you can see the 1/10 and one one hundredth sub dials aren't doing anything they actually will show time once you hit the stop so in this case it's at 25 seconds and 25.5 3 is this number the one tenth is out of 5 and the 1 1 is 100 set of 3 so it's 25 point five three seconds pretty easy to read you can keep keep going and then push it again stops and now we're at thirty point four four we'll keep going and you can stop it and now we're at thirty two point three seven and then you can reset it back to timing mode kind of a neat neat eat chronograph move on this one and to adjust all the different car the the different modes just the date the time and all that stuff you pull the crown out so I probably won't go through all of them because it's quite quite bland but basically you pull the crown out and you switch modes by pushing the bottom button and the segment the location of the second hand is what indicates which mode it's on it's right now it's on timing mode and if it's second hand over on this side it means it's p.m. if it's over on this side means a.m. and you push this is which is two different different times any mode from date month year etc etc and then there's also a mode where you push both these buttons to centre the chronograph hands if they are not centered so this is them in a little bit more here take a look at some of the details of the watch here the doll is pretty great there's the applied sub dial rings there and applied indexes they all have Loom on them so 13 millimeters thick 300 meter water resistance it's got the little scuba racer guy there in the back typical Aquarius or two-tone brush polished bracelet and the watch is a little bit cheaper on on the rubber but I think it's always best to buy a watch on I'm bracelet if you can and then add the rubber afterwards back cover so this uh that's pretty much it the tag all eraser caliber s hope that gives you a good explanation of least brief and good explanation of what the caliber s movement is capable of and I hope you really have a good one"
