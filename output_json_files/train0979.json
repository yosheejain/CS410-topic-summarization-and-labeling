        "transcript": "hey guys if go here and stand back with only video interview only showing you how to beat the 6th night on five nights at Freddy's 2 now there is a jests a genuine strategy that pretty much everybody uses to beat this now I did come up with this on my own but I realize a lot of other people do use this because there are very few strategical options on this night but I put a twist on this which I'll be explaining later but I'm going to go through the bare bones of the strategy first so do you understand the actual movements I'm doing then I'm going to tell you the twist I put on it which allowed me to get from night from there 4 a.m. to 6 a.m. now I was trying to do this for a really long time it took about 3 weeks playing not obviously not 24/7 but I was trying to get for ages you know the first night and the sixth night on the first game story was easy I just did in one go on this one it's really hard as a lot of people saying that they can't do it and I you know at the time I was trying to do it myself and I was like well I'm doing the strategy right you know I knew that other people you know when I checked online other people doing the same things like well I'm doing this right then why aren't I beating it and so you know this is the right all you want to be doing stuff in but it's something else it's going to really help you out so let's just go through what that strategy is and the reason everyone does it is of course there are very few options I know of any one other way of doing this and it didn't work for me either but I have seen other people do it but I only look at left then but other than that it's literally just this one so what you want to do you want to give look at the left light the flashlight the right light then why not music box when you've wound up the music box put down the kilometer and put the mask on instantly now I'm going to go through that a little bit more detail now when you look at the left vent you're looking out for a balloon boy you're looking out for chica a toy chica if you see him you want to put the mask on for five seconds but before you do so be sure to give a little flash to Fox you just in case sometimes when you put the mouse down if you're vulnerable that's when you're vulnerable to foxy and if you do that sometimes he will get you in a time that you're waiting for them to go and buy five seconds I don't just mean a 1 2 3 4 5 I'm talking 100 200 300 400 500 is what I do anyway and at that point take the mask off check again if that Enderman don't presume that they've gone because balloon boy can be really annoying on its night sometimes and he will stay there for more at five seconds and it's really annoying and there's really not much you can do about it he effectively kills me at the end of this game but I managed to you know just the six just rolled as he described my game up so I beat it but he literally just completely screwed me over if that happens there's nothing you can really do about it but generally the five seconds is all you'll need the same applies for the right vent with mangle and Troy Bonnie and if you when your fashioned the flashlight only do about free you don't need any more than that that's what I do just to be confident that foxy is not going to kill me while I'm on the one I might not the music box here so make sure you always fashion as well you just saw then the flashlight wasn't actually working for me but it still is still giving foxy his flash and pretty sure it is anyway because he really should have killed me else because I if that didn't count as a flash then I hadn't flashed him in ages or at least his eye with hearts in his way I just wouldn't have worked at all so that must give at least some somewhat of a flash to him which works quite well so and if I don't don't just flash when it's not that and thinking I can't see my can't see my I can't look at the the music box you can you just go be quick about it now as well when we once you've won the music box up do as much as you feel confident to do and then do one thing there's one thing you cannot do at that point you cannot then put the monitor down and start flashing em Italy won't kill you every time but you see then golden Freddy's there he'll appear randomly if you come out of that flashing he will kill you always put the mask down the second you come out of it as fast as you can because that also helps with lights of withered Bonnie with Freddy and with a chica as you just saw there because it's there there you know sometimes people they put the monitor down they wait to see if they're there then they put the mask on if you do that you're losing precious time just presume that they're there and as well once you once they have actually got you in that bit where you're you're waiting for them to go be sure if you're using sound to wait until the audio cue and the audio changes else what I did in this video I look to see when I could see the orange ball in the background at the moment I saw the orange wall wait for eyes I'll point out the moment right here I knew I could take it off and a generally good indicators you know when to take it off and as well make sure you're looking at our left side so you can instantly hit left vent once you come out of that which is always really helpful to anyone it is as fast as possible and get as much wind up in music-box as possible which is main priority has to be sometimes even if I literally is flashing red on the music box give a quick flash and just go for it ignore the vents sometimes you can sacrifice them and just hope that nothing is there now let me tell you the real big twist I put on this when I was trying to beat this I kept hearing stuff like listen for audio cues and I tried that and he admittedly it helped me out I got that probably got me from about 3 a.m. to 4 a.m. you know it added an extra hour to my night but I still couldn't beat it and I put it down in the end too sloppy mistakes foxy and the music box and all of them for me came down to fear factor you know I was I was nervous was playing the game because I was really conscious I can it jumps get any second because there's so many different people around the trikes that can jump scare you at this point at any at any point in this game so I was nervous and as always he making mistakes foxy I was too conscious of I'm just basically just too scared of foxy because he's got a horrible jump scare and it was making me not buying the music box up as much so him to pretty much the same sort of thing I wasn't winding the Box up enough and it was really screwing me over and the way I conquered this is with a complete twist which defies the normal game logic but it it helped me out here if I stop talking for a second you'll see what I mean there's no sound I played this game on mute I took the sound off I played it a much more confidently much more relaxed and as a result I actually beat the night I can't guarantee this will work for you but if the reason you're not beating the night is because of sloppy mistakes you know you're making mistakes that you know after the game you're like you're more annoyed and scared at the end because like I I should have beaten out I that was my own mistake there was no reasons to do that then it was just a mistake you know sometimes before I'd see toy bonnie down i'd i put the monitor but like no would panic and it's all over but by removing the sound i just played it confidently this is the first game i played without sound and i beat it in one go I was getting four am pretty much every time before and by that point you know make a mistake I wouldn't be fast enough I'd I'd freeze when I saw withered Bonnie or something that even just for a millisecond even a slightest bit of freeze and it's gone for and it's over I'd I'd be so conscious of Foxy had come out of the the monitor flashing even when I knew I shouldn't because I was the one who was saying that I should not be doing that I still didn't I got golden Freddy you can actually see that in one of my other videos I think it's top five on electronics that happens in where I was just a stupid error that's how I beat it the regular strategy left light flashlights right light box and trying to keep these in right order and then put the mast down but also if you if fear factors what's stopping you're beating it try turning the sound off and see if it works hope this video has been helpful for you or anyway informative reach or determine the comments below if this is really helps you out and it's helped you beat the night I really hope it does because it really helped me out please you take one second the hit like button below and thanks for watching"

        "transcript": "good morning good evening wherever you may be my name is Arata and welcome to The mailbag Showdown for the week of August 6th 2013 answering questions comments and giving opinions on the world of anime and Western otakus in general if you would like to send in an email you can at BC shown atlass reflection.net and without any further [Music] Ado let's get started hey ARA I'm a big fan I really enjoy your reviews and other little pieces of content I've always Wonder seeing as you are into anime to such a large extent being a collector of the shows bought to dis format I kind of wondered what anime or group of anime got you interested in the shows as a whole was it the dubs shows that you see on TV or did you become interested through some other means this is a bit of a complicated answer but I'll try to keep it short to save us both some time the first anime I recall watching was the old dub of Sailor Moon on television and that was like when I was really young like grade one to young but throughout my childhood there have been different anime that have come and gone like Pokemon Digimon Moni kns and they were always on TV and I just thought of them as regular cartoons at the time though I did really enjoy them and it wasn't until high school when I first went to the anime club there and was able to watch princess monoke that I really got the difference between anime from Japan and Western animation from the states shortly afterward I bought the DVD set for the third season of Slayers which was my first set in my now rather large collection and that's the story in the nutshell really where did the the origins of your reviewer outfit lie I would be interested about the reasons behind you and your jacket well for those who have been following me longer than a year you'll know that this is actually the second review of outfit I've ever actually had previously I used to walk around wearing a lab coat which is actually prominent in the majority of my reviews as I have not yet made more reviews with the Canada jacket as I have with the lab code but the reasoning for the lab code way back in the day is because when I was uh first starting doing reviewing I wanted something to make me look more professional is and uh around the same time I was thinking about that I ended up going to a university store with my sister cuz she had to pick up a bunch of things and this University store um was selling lab Coates mainly because the university had a nursing program and a bunch of other things that were required it so I saw it there and I was like you know that'd be rather cool wouldn't it and so I bought one for rather cheap and I kept it and I still have it and then I used it for like 3 and a half almost 4 years in reviewing but the reason I changed it is because I there was no reason for me to have a lab code it was I never tried to come off as a great scientist or a doctor of any means and it was just kind of a thing I just started the war and it didn't really have a purpose so I wanted to change it out with something but I didn't really know what I went with the Canada jacket because a lot of people still mistake that uh I'm either an American or that I'm a European one of the two but I also wanted to be anime related so what did I ended up find finding was an image that was drawn by the manga for uh Italia Axis powers where the character of Canada was set up in a similar to a mounty outfit and he was just like kind of there enjoying a drink uh it's not actually a mounty outfit actually um because I actually researched this outfit quite a bit it's actually closer to the um Royal outfits that the Guardsmen wear to protect the queen over in England but you can kind of see the resemblance and that was kind of the thing so I took that image I sent it off to uh a cosplay sort of maker and paid a bunch of money that probably more than I should have and they sent me back my wonderful jacket and I have been using it ever since it looks cool and I'm happy with it so yeah that's uh the story of the jacket I like to listen to music from anime on my iPod while listening to it it brings back mental images of the anime that I liked this makes me wonder how much of my enjoyment of the music is from the music itself and how much of it is due to my associating it with the anime what are your thoughts on this can an anime you love make you like its mediocre music and how much can music improve your appreciation of an anime have you ever fallen in love with the music related to an anime even before seeing the anime personally I do think that having a song in an anime does add something to it especially if you like the anime in question I know a lot of my favorite anime tracks are because when I listen to them it's almost like I'm reliving the original watching of the scene that they are from over again for the first time and there really is a nice feeling in that when positive emotions are attached to things it makes them much more memorable in my opinion as for if I've ever fallen in love with music related to an anime before ever actually seeing the anime yes there are two cases that I can think of off the top of my head first case being uh subasa resir Chronicles which I have owned actually for quite a while but because I haven't had access to a Blu-ray player for who knows how long and I own it in Blu-ray I wasn't able to watch it and at this point I just haven't gotten around to it but because it's Yuki kajra music and because I freaking love Yuki kajra music I was able to listen to the entire sound TR long ago and I basically fell in love with the thing the only other example I have would be the music for Interstellar 5555 because of course as I have mentioned previously that entire soundtrack is just da Punk and da Punk is amazing and so that's it for me for this week if you would like to send in an email please make sure to check out my FAQ video to make sure that I have not already answered what you may ask and after that feel free to send me a message at mailbag Showdown atlass reflection.net and I will get to your email when I have the time with the best of them being used for the show please subscribe for more videos and weekly anime reviews follow me on Twitter at glass reflection if you so desire and until next time ladies gentlemen and others stay frosty [Music] h [Music]"

        "transcript": "this video is to show you how to use a number line model to divide fractions suppose we have a fraction of 3/4 and we'd like to divide that by 1/2 the first step is to draw the first fraction on a number line the second step is to take our number line and divided by the denominator of the second fraction in this case we're just separating each section of our number line into halves now that I've completed step two step three involves converting both fractions to the same denominator not just a common denominator but the common denominator that results from multiplying the denominators of both fractions in this case I need a denominator of 8 so the first fraction becomes 6 out of 8 and the second fraction becomes 4 out of 8 step 4 requires that we make arcs to see how many times 1/2 can fit into 3/4 we do this by recognizing the numerator of the second fraction is the number of sections we need in each arc in this case we need 4 sections for each arc that's one section that we can complete that comprises 1 2 3 4 sections now if I try to make a second arc you can see that I run out because I only have two sections remaining the last part of this question and step 5 is to then make sense of the answer that we have we can see that we have only one full arc so I write down that I have one whole arc that I have completed and then I need to see how much is left I can see that I have two sections left and I know that I required four sections in order to make a single arc that means I have one and two quarters ARC's in my picture my answer is that one half goes into three quarters one and a half times because of course one in two quarters is equal to one and a half with a number line model you do not actually have to reduce your fractions because the picture shows the answer of one and two quarters but you may reduce it to one and a half if you wish"

        "transcript": "available hey guys and welcome back my name is oh happy and today we are going to be talking about the exotic machine gun in destiny called thunderlord this thing is a complete beast it's really fun because it's got a pretty slow rate of fire but very high damage um you gotta watch me go through a few fun clips of just wrecking teams with it and then we're gonna go over the stats as well here you see me using it i really like the noise it makes when you shoot it kind of reminds me of the headshot sound from call of duty but on every single time he fires just like tink tink tink very cool very fun i did find this gun actually playing a crucible match i'll show you that as well here in a second of what it looks like when you find an exotic just randomly playing in a crucible match it shows up in the kill feed in the bottom left very nice but this gun is by far the best machine gun i've used in the game given i haven't got my hands on some of the other legendaries or exotics it is just very good i have never been a fan of the machine guns that have the high fire rate um quick time to kill but low range and high recoil because heavy ammo in destiny is so rare so to speak you probably only are going to get it two times a game that means that you need to really conserve it and so when you have high recoil and high fire rate you're just wasting a lot of shots this fire is slow enough and only takes two three four shots to kill um you can conserve ammo and really make the most of what you do have you see here i've only got eight shots left in the clip i still feel confident that i can pick up a kill with that while a higher firing gun i would not see that took i think five shots to get that kill and i believe i missed one there so yes it is a very very fun gun it's very cool looking it's this bright blue color and it has like sparks that run down the side turns out the only thing that could shut me down with that gun was a guy with his gunslinger super on so here's where you actually see me earning i'm just playing a match getting some head shots going for my um upgrading my hand cannon that i've been using this is a pretty fun hand cannon and here i get the final kill i believe and down on the bottom left you'll see in the kill feed oh haple found thunderlord so this is how it'll look if you do find an exotic in destiny in the crucible but yeah i thought it was pretty cool and then it shows up in your little rewards pane on the right but let's go over some of the stats because that's probably what most of you guys are most interested in so the little card for it says thunderlord they rest quiet on fields of far for this is no ending but the eye so i have no idea what that means but sounds pretty cool it does have a base damage of 260 but it can be upgraded all the way up to 300 and depending on which model you specifically get you'll have a few options available to you it will fire faster the more at and more accurately the longer the trigger is held and additionally kills with the weapon increase your reload speed so those are both very good to keep you on target using less ammo and then able to reload and get your ammo and additionally the one that mine came with that i'm really looking forward to unlocking is called perfect balance which decreases the recoil this will make this thing almost like a scout rifle i would imagine where you can just go tink tink tank three shot kill everybody very very powerful i'm looking forward to having that this gun has been a blast to use here you see me picking up some more ammo after using my super and it's almost like when you use this gun the things that shut you down are going to be other heavy weapons and supers and so it does feel pretty op you gotta figure that you get some 40 or 50 or 60 rounds when you first pick up the ammo um usually it takes me five to ten shots to get each kill well that's several kills you gotta figure you know that's five to ten kills at least that you're going to get with this weapon so you just want to play it slow play it smart use its um you can actually use this somewhat like i talked about like a scout rifle where it's rate of fire is slow enough where you can just pull the trigger quickly and release just to let off one round so you can be very accurate with it um and use it in a somewhat semi-auto mode which i do recommend if you're at longer ranges so you're not just wasting a ton of your ammo here what you see in the game we're at the point where we're just racing to hunt them down and racing for kills because these guys aren't providing us much of a challenge see here i missed several shots even though he gets the snipe on me and almost kills me i still manage to get him fairly easily it's a beast of a gun i hope you guys enjoyed this thunderlord it is the heavy machine gun for destiny it's an exotic it's a beast make sure to like favorite and subscribe if you did enjoy and i will talk to you guys later"

        "transcript": "hey everyone well a lot of people have gotten a new iOS 7 for their iPhone and the first complaints we've heard are about battery life um this is a common thing that happens with a lot of people that get a smartphone but there's been some things about iOS 7 that make it a little bit more prone to draining your battery than previous versions of iOS now a couple things I want to go over first are some of the basic things that you need to always do even if you have old iOS any smartphone to save battery life you have to remember the thing about smartphones they're not so much phones anymore as they are computers so it's kind of uh naive to think that the battery is going to last two or 3 days that's just not what they're meant to do anymore they're getting better through time but remember this is essentially a computer it's not a phone anymore so just you have to treat it like your laptop or a tablet you're going to get a day maximum amount of these but there are ways to be more efficient with your battery life the first thing you'll notice is any and this is for any phone by the way when I turn my phone on the first thing I go to is the settings and this is something you can do regardless of what phone you have is to look for the brightness settings you go to the brightness wallpapers and brightness and turn on auto brightness this means it'll auto adjust based on the brightness of the room there's actually a sensor up here near the earpiece that will sense the amount of light in the room and adjust accordingly um the one thing you want to do is adjust this brightness here to the lowest one you possibly can that's still tolerable by yourself because the brighter your screen the more battery you're going to use up so try to keep it as dim as possible the other thing is when you're done with your phone I always lock it you don't want the screen on when you're not using it so I always hit the power button and I turn it off that will save battery life now let's get into some of the things that really drain your battery more than anything else uh you got to remember every smartphone has three antennas it has a Bluetooth antenna it has a Wi-Fi antenna and it has your cellular network antenna anytime those antennas are in use it's going to be draining battery life so you want to turn as many of those off as possible when they're not in use the one nice thing about iOS 7 is it gives you the shortcut to turn off your cell signal you can go to airplane mode you can turn off your Wi-Fi or your Bluetooth do not turn your Bluetooth on unless you're using it because it'll always be searching for another Bluetooth device eating up battery so you want to keep keep those off as much as possible I'm at home right now and I'm on Wi-Fi so obviously I have my Wi-Fi on so I leave it on but here's some places to look to turn things off in your settings go to settings go to General and the first thing you want to look at is go to um your background app refresh right here make sure this is turned off if you turn it on all the apps you have in the background will be running basically refreshing that means not only will they eat back battery they're going to eat up your data plan if you're not on Wi-Fi so you want a disable background app refresh that will save you a load of battery usage as well as data usage if you're on a sell plan it's not unlimited the next thing you want to do is go back to your settings and go to privacy now you don't see it in here off the bat you have to go back to the next menu and go to privacy and in here you see location services one of the things that drains your battery more than anything is GPS so go in here and location services are turned on because I want them on for certain features so what you got to do is scroll all the way to the bottom this is kind of a hidden menu all the way at the bottom you're going to see system Services right there if you click that system Services you're going to see everything that's using your GPS so you see Diagnostics and usage I don't necessarily want to be sending that out I don't want iPad I ads on so I turn that off turn as many of these off as you want or that you don't need but one thing I noticed in iOS 7 especially in the iPhone 5 if you go to frequent locations not only is this kind of creepy it tracks where you're at now I think they do this basically to to Target ads but also coupons and promotions if you go to a restaurant or store all the time you want to make sure this is toggled off I have it turned off right now if it's turned on you'll see it like that it'll improve map and look it actually shows you where have youve been so I turn this off because I don't want the GPS on at all so I turn these off as many of these as possible I try to turn these off so the big thing to do is go into settings check as many of these location services as possible obviously you want to use your GPS at certain times but if you want to save battery life completely turn off the GPS if you're in a meaning or something you're not using it just turn it off you can always turn it back on one of the other things that's kind of hitting in here if you go to settings is go back all the way to the the main menu if you scroll through here here you'll see cellular now this is something I do a lot when I'm on the golf course or I'm out in the woods somewhere hiking or running I may not need 4G LTE turned on 4G LTE it's a great data service but it eats up battery life like crazy so if you're not going in need of fast data speeds turn that off that'll save you a load of battery life and just keep your cellular data which is essentially 3G so you could just keep that up that's another way to save uh battery life another thing and this is kind of a a neat little trick you notice my background is pretty dark now a lot of people like different pictures in their background but believe it or not the brighter your screen as I mentioned before about brightness the more battery life it uses so the brighter your background image the more power it takes to display it so with all these dark spaces I have up here in a dark blue is basically a globe image here um The Wider this image is here the more battery life it's going to eat up so you may want to select a background image that actually is pretty dark that way it'll save you on some of your battery life and as always one thing you want to do whenever you're using your phone as soon as you're done is make sure you put it back to sleep like that another thing I showed you the background app refresh make sure you're closing those out even if you don't have an odd so I close all these background apps so they're not running in the background as much as possible that will help save you a load of battery life so those are just a couple tips and tricks to kind of save on your battery life again I'm done so I'm going to turn that off that helps save your battery life as well so those are just a few things that will help you kind of reduce your battery usage during the day it's never going to be foolproof but maybe you can sneak 5 to 10% more out of your battery life during any given day I hope these are helpful and I hope you have a great time today if you have any questions about using your iPhone go ahead and shoot them way I'm a tech geek and a weather geek at the same time"

        "transcript": "family engagement is traditionally been viewed as ways that we can bring parents and other caregivers into the school where we are to help out with us in one way or another but it's so important that we begin to realize and recognize what it is that our students are doing outside of school with language with any of the experiences that they have and that we as teachers can document those experiences so that we can find ways as teachers to bring those experiences into the school you know as Educators we have to understand that families are pivotal they are the most important factor in the development of the child's uh identity as a scholar and the child's goals for the future and when we can work with families then we have a better chance of of reaching those goals if we minimize the family if we pretend that we're The Gatekeepers to the Future then we're not just losing the family we're losing the child also to some degree so when we're thinking about family engagement and early um learning environment ments in classrooms we really want to keep in mind that parents are an integral part of the community that they're needed and that they want to be a part of their children's lives and experiences and we can engage them with tech tools or non- te tools it just depends on what access that they have and what works best for us and being intentional and thoughtful for many of us we're working with family involvement or family engagement apples and oranges but there's a real difference family involvement we just sort of going out together family engagement we put a ring on it it's a deeper deeper relationship with families and that relationship is based on trust and respect every child knows whether we trust and respect their families and vice versa that is all building on relationship is absolutely key trust and respect write it down how cut it out cut whatever you need to cut out"

        "transcript": "hey what's up guys T here c a video today oh my god I've been thinking about this one for a while wiet came out in the brand new dragons of Legend booster set and I've been looking forward to this card for a while actually ever since it was activated by trudge in uh the first episode of 5DS um which was back in 2008 I believe in April yeah so Yap is interesting card um it's like very similar to 7even TOS the Bandit um very similar in application however very different in actual Theo uh if we apply it in that sense um Yap obviously I've got a German uh card here obviously I've got the the definition of the card itself so Yap when a trap card is activated negate the activation and if you do Shuffle that card into the deck okay and what does seven TOS the Bandit do I can't quite remember that one yeah when the Trap card is activated pay a th000 life points negate the activation and if you do destroy it right so very similar application although obviously they have a major difference but people are like oh yeah you can either play you know either car doesn't really matter I mean it's going to be a super rare in the set so it's not really that hard to get hold of um wi Taps so it's not really big deal however actually if you think about it in more fuo sense the cards are very different seven TOS of the Bandit you know you are paying Live points and obviously we're going into a format now uh between dragons of Legend and the Primal Origin which is about two or 3 weeks of uh this this weird format that we're going to be in and um during that time Nationals for the UK is going to happen it's going to be a few regionals in America so you're going to have to consider it that there's a possibility that gear gears might be playing wiretap instead of seven TOS the Bandit just so that they can resolve their soul charge with an extra thousand life points in the bank so that they can get some more monsters and probably create a more formidable field but does WAP is WAP better in that just because the fact that you don't have to pay any life points the answer really is no I mean it's not better or worse I mean it's different it depends exactly what you're going to use that, life points for seven TOS the Bandit wise if you're not playing Soul charge you don't have to worry about it Yap what you're actually doing is you're putting the cards that you're negating back in the deck and to be honest you really want to be putting trap cards back in the deck I mean like for inance think of like lightning Chidori you're putting a monster back into the deck right and you know that that monster is not in the graveyard so they can't Soul charge they can't call the haunted um they have to research the card back into their hand or get it in back onto the field again so putting a monster back into the deck is very very good because it means that they have to draw it back and it means that they're not going to be drawing to something else realistically um you can't compare it to something else that bounces like jadori because actually trap cards you know they kind of go into the graveyard they just sort of sit there and do anything so you know more or less you just kind of want to negate it and put them in there because what you're paying for in seven TOS the Bandit which is the big thing of this video what you're paying for in seven TOS of the Bandit is information I mean if you negate the second mirror Force for example and then you fan your opponent's graveyard to check to see if your otk is going to go through and then you see that they've got two mirror Force then you're like oh good that means that they're not going to really stop me they might have deep prison but to be honest I mean if you know they're not running de prison then you can go straight ahead you know or you've got like you can put read on your opponent that they're not going to have a de prison then that's good you know that's great with Y tap you're putting the cards back into the deck there is a possibility that they're going to redraw these trap cards again which is not good because a lot of the time you don't want to redraw uh warning again because then you have to find another way to kill it you know to stop it you know cuz warning isn't win condition in itself you know it's like like you negate the miror force put it back in you've got they've got a miror force left and they've got a few face Downs later on in the game and then one of those could be miror Force so you've negated it put it back in the deck and then you've kind of jeopardized your possibility of an otk going through anyway with Seven Swords you are literally paying 1,000 life points to um place a card onto the graveyard for you to be able to reference it later and be able to uh literally kind of play through your opponent's back row a bit better because you're actually able to Fan your opponent's graveyard and see what they have so Yap takes away that that free information which which you don't have to pay for you just have to check your opponent's graveyard but in return you don't have to pay life points when in a soul charge format is going to be a big deal which is why some people are opting to cut out Solem warning and um that's a card that you really need to negate because if you take away solemn warning um which is now you know it's going to be taken away by some people because they want to be able to resolve Soul charge properly um then you don't need seven SS the Bandit you'd much rather just run traps down because it's the only counter trap worth negating anyway you guys comment down below your opinions of both cards which one you think is better you know taking into consideration the upcoming format and I will see you guys in a few days so thanks for watching guys and until next time the TG lover is out"

I've never felt like I was going to break one of the clips off while I was doing it anything like that in terms of the design you can tell it's it's more squarish like a lot of phones are these days but yeah that that's the hardware in a nutshell just to show off the video camera performance of this so I took a just a video clip walking the pooch earlier today walking around one of the hiking trails here started my hand got in that way the camera there but I know it's difficult to tell video quality when you're looking at a video of a video on Amazon but overall I was really happy with how well it turned out it looks great on the screen he was just the video clips I like this part at least I've Android here's some pictures that I took of Nicky but in the preview it'll show you the movies playing so I was happy with the performance of that one to the home screen there anyway just want to show that off and again overall I've been really happy really impressed by this phone for $150 it has exceeded my expectations so well happy shopping and I recommend that you give this some consideration alright thanks a lot for watching I'd also like to show a quick comparison between the a 3s and a Samsung Galaxy s3 I've had this for about two and half years and a reason I'm showing you this is that this is $150 and these are going unlocked for a little over two hundred dollars right now so you may be shopping for both at the same time they're more similar than they are different the screens are very similar you can see here both our fingerprint magnets in terms of screen size they're the same width the i3s is a little bit taller screen screen quality it's exaggerated by this video that this gets dimmer off access like that but the s3 is slightly better but they're both very good screens in my opinion they're both quick phones they have about the same speed as far as I can tell the backs are both plastic so I've heard it mentioned before that the plastic back some people think it feels cheap that's what I thought of the s3 when I first got it but I turns out I love it it's virtually carefree it's held up great it comes off very easily same for this one you get to the battery's SIM card memory card slot I really like the plastic back I think it's a nice touch so I have no problem with that at all the big difference between them or differences is that this is a 4G phone and this is a 3G phone so this has something called H+ which I'm not that familiar with but when I do downloads on this I get about 9 to 10 megabits per second and this one gives me about 30 to 35 so this one's a little bit faster also this one has a physical home button so they they both have capacitive buttons on the sides this one has a physical home button so you can turn the phone on with this if you want but other than that they are very similar phones this one I was surprised at how well it compares to the s3 which has been a just a great phone in my opinion so I just wanted to show that off because you may be shopping for both because they're fairly close in in price if you want for GE don't go with this one but if 3g is fast enough for you this is an excellent choice and it saves you some money"

        "transcript": "know your rooll is shut your damn mouth sorry got a little testy there been watching the WWE Network on my PS3 okay what let's talk about this WWE Network seriously now WWE Network $10 a month $60 up front that way you don't screw WWE out of the free WrestleMania you know so if you get it and you get WrestleMania canceled the next day you know not g be like oh you screw me no you actually pay for it ahead of time so it ain't like you're gonna screw them out of it so the WWE network is it worth it is it not okay before I decided to get it I went on Plenty of reviews watched people's reviews on it and I really didn't see anything that you know kind knew what's the word I'm looking for satisfied me so hopefully this video will Enlighten you more than what other videos have enlightened me first thing is I recommend everybody do the one week trial okay I started the onee trial today and honestly I'm probably going to end it by the end of next week I probably end it with the free trial not even bother getting it um I I think it's worth the $10 a month I don't think it's worth the $60 up front unless you have the $60 to to spend up front front I don't think it's worth the $60 up front there's a lot of cool things on there but there's a lot of things that should be on there that I just feel isn't and it's disappointing uh first things first some of the stuff that's on there you have every ECW WCW and WWE pay-per-view um I watch spring stamp P 1998 WCW spring stamp 1998 that was the first thing I watched when I got it I loved the WCW back in that time I loved the Diamond Dallas Page versus Raven Raven and the Raven Rules match I loved Booker T versus Chris Mano for the uh what was it the TV title I loved um Chris Jericho versus Prince a I loved Macho Man vers thing I just love that whole pay-per-view so that was the one pay-per-view that I jumped on right away and I wanted to watch it mostly just see what kind of how far back they went and you know so on in the range and it did pretty much had every pay-per-view that I wanted to see after that I watched Royal Rumble 1999 Mankind versus The Rock and I Quit match that's why I came on with to shut your mouth ja broni you know cuz I just got done watching it um what disappoints me the most about this uh Network thing is you don't have recent stuff it's like raw I wonder like what happens if my DVR didn't catch raw last week you know $60 up front $10 a month raw better be on there I didn't see Raw on there um they did like a raw rewind show that's not good enough for me they they have last month the elimination chamber on there okay elimination chamber was a few weeks ago it should have been on there at this point this is what you're paying for also I work third shift so most of the time I don't get to watch pay-per-views unless I request it off I want to be able to know if I'm paying for this network when I get home in the morning can I watch the Pay-Per-View that took place the previous night so today Sunday let's say there's a pay-per-view tonight say if SummerSlam was tonight and I can't watch cuz I work third shift and I work on Sundays when I get home in the morning is there going to be an oncore um edition of SummerSlam on WWE Network that that's yet to be seen I have yet to see that if they don't have elimination chamber out yet what's the chance of them having that on there I tried to watch Raw the last raw they had on there was from January and we are in March now so a lot of different problems I'm having with it um I just think they need to it it should be like an on demand service all the back stuff is great but they don't have much selection when it comes to other things documentaries I'm I'm a huge documentary fan I watch documentaries and all kinds of I watch every WWE documentary I can get my hands on went to go to documentary there was no documentary the only documentary I saw was Bret har verus Shawn Michael's rival now you guys can say well Rob the the app just came out W Network just came out you got to give them time if they had enough time to have the entire AR Archive of WCW ECW and the WWE pay-per-views they had enough time to put them documentaries on there okay I mean if they're not wasting time charging me my $60 they shouldn't have to make me wait for my documentaries okay I would love to see  the documentary on Chris Jericho Big Show like I I watched all the documentaries the history of WrestleMania I watched them when they were on Netflix some of them are still on Netflix the rise and fall of WCW uh the rise and fall of ECW that's not on Netflix but the WCW one is and the history of the NW all that's on Netflix I don't see none of that on this this network and this is what this network was supposed to be about give you all that wrestling content I didn't see that on here but without a doubt the the thing that frustrates me the most is the fact that they they don't have recent Raw SmackDown or pay-per-views on there I want to be able to come home that next morning don't have to worry about DVR go on to my D Network and watch last night's raw watch the last night's pay-per-view watch last night's Smackdown I want to be able to be in to everything and another thing I do not like about it is you cannot watch Raw live on there I actually seen the the schedule for this coming Monday and they have a raw pre-show and then it goes to the W Network programming for the next three hours instead of it showing raw you think the WWE Network would play raw as well okay it just seems logical that would also stop people from getting cable and different things that could just just run with the WB Network but no I don't know if that's because they signed a deal with USA or what but just a couple things that just irritates me with that I recommend you get to free trial it's cool to go back and watch some of the great like pay-per-views back in the day cuz there was a lot of awesome pay-per-view I just don't think at this particular time that I'm willing to drop $60 for this and then $10 a mon I think right now I'm just kind of satisfied with Dro in $60 for Wrestlemania and just save my $10 a month or maybe at that time I'll be willing to pay that $60 a month as as right now I'm saving up for Megacon and to drop $60 on something that doesn't really have what I need such as the elimination chamber last week's raw and last week's Smackdown then it just seems kind of pointless because I can just go on YouTube and watch the same exact stuff so that's my opinion op of it I know a lot of people have been having mixed reviews on it but I never seen no one actually talk about that so hopefully if you're thinking about it just hold off I say wait a while wait closer to WrestleMania if you plan on doing it just don't do it now um there's definitely things they need to do in it because I just feel like you're not getting the bank for your buck right now um so be sure to leave comments in the comment box below be sure to you know share like subscribe until next time guys I'm storm Inc and know your roll ja broni"

Gambling and you? Terrible idea. He was a control freak. Thought every detail through.  But there were some things he couldn\u2019t control. The real world cannot be perfect.  Even King Yudish failed sometimes. Imagine, then, the comfort of a game, of control. Even for Yudish, most virtuous of kings, I knew \n it was only a matter of time. What drove him to the city's most dangerous quarter?  His own weakness, or some larger design? Whose hand that set this chain of events in motion, this deadly stream that flowed into the greatest battle this earth has seen? Yudish waited nervously in the gambler's quarter.

Douglas Graham is the father of the 80/10/10 movement and I thought he must be the perfect person to ask about the 80/10/10 diet welcome thank you very much for having enjoy being really thank you I wanted to ask you talk about the key issues that people face when they switch to the 80/10/10 diet oh sure there's lots of key issues because the program is really very very simple and in many ways people oversimplify to the point of not really following the program where they think they're following the program when they're really not or they haven't done the numbers enough to just be familiar this isn't a diet that requires a lot of weighing and measuring but you don't have to at least learn the basics so you know what you're dealing with to understand that most fruits have a single-digit fat percentage and that most vegetables have a have a protein percentage in the teens to just know some of the little bitty basics that the fruits carry a lot more calories than vegetables as a rule but I think the primary thing about the diet is then it's a program where you experience no cravings if you're experiencing any cravings at all you're not following 80/10/10 you've missed some critical link of it there's really only five basic food cravings they are the craving for sweets at the end of a meal most people experience that after almost every meal hence the need for dessert they are looking for a dessert right and and this this is a clear indicator that the the meal wasn't sweet enough itself that the meal wasn't satisfying if you're only going to be satisfied by fillings craving for sweets at the end you don't even really have to ever have cravings we want to be able to work out of preferences and choice not out of cravings or obsessions or addictions and we really want to be able to just say well I'd prefer this or I'd prefer that and and let it go so if you're craving sweets at the end of the meal or if you're craving sweets in between meals if you're craving sweets in between meals whether it's chocolate or candy or alcohol or dried fruit these are all very good indicators that the last meal wasn't sweet enough to hold you until the next meal because the satiation factor that is key is always sugar if you don't have enough sugar your blood sugar plummets and you experience appetite this happens again and again and again you must supply enough sugar at a meal so that it will hold your blood sugar stable through to the next meal so those two cravings for sugar whether it's in between meals or at the end of a meal those are dead giveaways that your lifestyle isn't sweet enough it doesn't have enough fresh fruit if you crave heavy foods at the end of the meal as I'm fond of saying Oh give me a few nuts maybe a handful of nuts at the heck with it just hand me the bagging not so I'm gonna eat nuts well what happens invariably where I want an avocado and maybe another avocado I can't get enough of akkad oh if you're craving really heavy rich food at the end of a meal this once again tells you you didn't eat enough fruit it's a real simple thing when we convert our complex carbohydrate intake totally over to fruit to the simple carbohydrates and fruit you have to eat a lot of volume it takes a little bit of getting used to in the mindset to see a bigger pile of food and realize that it's actually a smaller pile of calories so we have to eat enough volume and and if you what happens with these protein or the fatty cravings at the end of the meal you really want something rich and invariably what happens is you eat all those nuts and then you still want something sweet it's just your brain was playing a little trick saying I need to get the calories from something really concentrated it didn't first picture it didn't first trigger fruit as an idea or sweet as an idea but by the time you've eaten all the nuts you care for most the time you still find out you know I really want something sweet anyway"

        "transcript": "hey guys this is a devil welcome back to my channel this is going to be a tricks and tips video on the human male engineer class I'm going over the powers just like in other videos but you don't need to sit and pause because I am going to go over them throughout the video this is my overload spec just in case anybody's wondering but the first thing I'm going to immediately talk about is the combat drone deploy this attack drone to stand on the mccarthy from draw enemy fire i only have one point in this thing and i'm going to make this case in point right now i shot this little clip against the atlas to show you guys that one point is all you need if this thing works against an atlas it will work against anything it's it says that it could stun enemies but you're only going to use this in tirana compare I just zoomed in right there you saw me deploy it that ad list turns around and wastes his big rocket on this drone this thing has such a low respawn you constantly have it up as soon as it kills it put another one up all its gonna do is cause the Atlas to keep turning around turning around and shooting the thing it's also really great against got the shield guys because in a one-on-one face-to-face the engineers not good against the shield unless you can get them to turn around and it's an easy kill i'm also using in senator mo in this video but don't pay you to that this is a really cool thing that i got rocket I killed two atlases one shot but anyways back to the video I'm going to talk about the powers I already went over the combat drove only one point remember that that's really important then you got incinerated burned your opponents and incinerate their armor heavy damage to health and armor make an enemy panic stopping health regeneration now that's great but this this ability is a direct fire ability it has to travel to the target means if they jump on cover or try to dodge you're gonna miss so that's why I only put three points into it I'm not level 20 yet so you guys you know you can put more points of that later it's definitely a good ability but to do damage with but it's not that great compared to overload overload is overload electronics with this power surge stunning your enemy effective in shields barriers and synthetics but not as effective as a good against organics I'm gonna say [\u00a0__\u00a0] to the last part i put six points into this as fast as i could this is a great ability to recharge is very low the first three you have to use and then for the fourth one i did jump to another target the fifth one I instead of more damage I took look lower cooldown I believe because I use this thing constantly and then the 6-point goes in to jump to another targets who I use this thing I'll shoot it out hit a target and it'll jump to two other targets hitting them too and it'll stun targets which is great for this class this is a very last cannon e-class lots of damage easy to die not to compensate for this you go into your alliance training in your fitness which we're but I'm about to talk about Alliance training is the generic more damage more power more strength I don't need to redo the prettiest is very obvious is for health or shields and melee damage and durability so more health more feels and more la damage is great for this class but you don't want to put that many points into it because you're a support class this is and this is the best support class in the game I no surprise surprise another engineer is the best support class in any game and being a support class it's very important if you have great teammates with you hey you can you need a great really good base of fire otherwise you're not going to succeed this is that intro clip against the Atlas I showed you guys is great because my teammates were hoping me killed this thing so you can save your rockets for emergency situations like you're going to see in a little bit i'm going to hack a terminal and my buddy uses a rocket to cover me from an atlas that's like walking up on my face or like an emergency situation where your friend is dying in an atlas is standing right next to him in you can't go and provide one that too now I'm gonna go over the load out for this guy just a standard assault rifle is what I roll with this is on silver difficulty it's the last breath the 10th round and extraction I'm on extraction right now we're just wrecking another Atlas it's it's a lot of fun it's really intense I had some great teammates with me i'm not the best player in this game I come in a second I believe but that's because this is just a port class you shouldn't be the guy in the front doing everything you should be supporting your teammates reviving people sticking kinda to the back and helping them out now abilities are huge on this character so that's what you'll need to bring the assault rifles you use your abilities constantly this class is great as support but yeah like just just don't try to tank with it that's that's all I'm trying to get at use your it's very fun to play this class the drone is it makes you feel smart because you can make enemies turn around and look like idiots and protect your teammates or its exceptional against turrets turrets for some reason a lot of people don't like to kill because they don't give you that many points but they will wreck your team if somebody dies I just needed constantly somebody will die next to a turret and nobody will know about it and then the other guy will run up to them and try to provide them and just get mowed down by the same turret they do a lot of damage if they can get a target the drone distracts it did you shoot a drone at the target or at the turret the tour will sit there and shoot at the drum for a while well this is the end of the video like a boss everybody finishes we get a perfect extraction you can see the rewards for silver are very high make sure you guys rate comment and subscribe I'm going to keep putting out new videos this one is a lot shorter I think you guys appreciate that but and if you stay tuned for another couple seconds it's going to go to the end clip and you guys can have some nice links to click on such thanks a lot guys this is devil I'll talk to you later you"

        "transcript": "hello guys this is the long-term review of xiaomi redm note 4G in this video I'm going to talk everything about this phone which you should consider before picking up one so let's get started first of all we'll start with the specifications this phone is powered by 1.6 GHz quadcore Snapdragon processor 2 gigs of RAM 8 gigs of internal storage in which you get around 4.6 adreno 305 GPU and it is a single Sy device which supports 4 G as you can see and coming back to the phone we'll talk about built mini USB port for charging and data syncing here we have mic the call quality is very good excellent at top we have 3.5m audio jack secondary noise cancellation mic and it has some curved edges at right side we have power on off button volume rockers xiaomi redm note 4G is available only in glossy white it detects some fingerprints here is the speaker the output of the speaker is above average here is shomi silver logo here we have notification LED light front facing camera and earpiece it is 9.5 mm thickness and weights around 188 G which is some sort of heavy please don't use any flip flip covers because it is already heavy I bought a flip cover and my brother used it as dumbles when attached a flip cover to it and the call Quality is excellent as I mentioned it and talking about the display we have 5.5 in 720p HD display with 267 of pixels per inch the touch sensitivity is very very smooth I didn't face any issues with the touch screen the touch response is very very good and I also didn't notice any pixelation on this device and we also have auto brightness sensor now coming to the camera we have 5 map front facing camera we have beauy mode which makes your selfies even more smoother and we had a good 13 MP camera and the rear facing camera is one of the best around 10,000 rupees price point I will show you some pictures captured with this 13 MP rear facing camera and we will zoom in to this bike as you can see the number plate is visible and we can also read that number 8225 as you can see even though if you zoom in the sharpness is very good and let's look at some more pictures I will I focused on this Auto let's read this number see we can also read this number it is visible very clearly the camera quality is one of the best and the color reproduction is also very good colors seems to be very natural and it's good camera and you can record videos up to 1080p from this 13 MP rear facing camera now we will talk about this software which is very important for mobile out of the box it runs on MIUI 5 after several updates now my device is running on MIUI 6.5 on top as you can see 6.5.4 and it is running on KitKat and it doesn't matter even though it has 5.o lollipop because it runs on custom UI there are some ugly things and worse things in the software Department if you have some apps in the background after some time the memory just erases and the app reloads after some time even though it has 2 gigs of RAM and the other issue is if you are running some apps and if you hit the home button it takes half a second or 1 second to come back to the home screen uh and the UI is laggy 20% of the time rather than I didn't have any issues Mii is very much custom customizable and you can also set up colors for the notification light like you can select blue color for Mr call green color for battery draining and other some red color yellow color there are some few more colors you can set them up and very customizable Mi UI the best thing in this UI is them section now I didn't connect it to my Wi-Fi connection so I can't preview this all I'm showing you my downloaded themes these are the themes you can change the complete look of this phone with these themes which are excellent now my device is running on this default theme and now talking about the battery we have a 3100 MH battery and the battery life is very very good I would say it's excellent it gives me full day of battery backup with moderate to heavy usage and while charging it heats up a little bit but don't worry guys it takes 3 to 300 and half hours for full charge 0 to 100% And now talking about gaming I have already done a separate gaming video you can watch that for more info and the gameplay on this device is very smooth and I have tried Modern Combat 5 FIFA 15 Asphalt 8 all these games high-end games are very smooth even though Brothers in Arms very high in game it is also very smooth the Asphalt 8 is smooth before the update after the OTA update uh it lags and it is very common in all the device after the update asphal date is lagging and I suggest you to play high-end games in performance mode and no heating issues while playing the games the maximum temperature I noticed is 45.4 De while charging and that's it from this video guys if you have any doubts please post them in the comments if you like this long-term review hit the like button or thumbs down hit the Subscribe button lot more videos are coming thank you guys thanks for watching"

        "transcript": "[Applause] hello everybody this is J's top five texture packs this week well they're not really top five they're just random ones I have so okay let's start off with moon train I think Moon train is awesome texture pack I absolutely love it um the colors are very very very very very contrasty which are really good like the grass and the mud it just goes really really well they match each other but they contrast as well so you get like light areas and dark areas and when you break stuff like that it's quite a basic breaking it doesn't have like some sort of unique breaking thingy and what I'm going to do on each thing I'm going to pop up these on the crafting bench chest and the furnace so on the crafting bench and the chest I think the colors are really really really nice they like different shades of wood and then on the furnace I think that looks awesome I actually love the furnace that's probably one of my favorite um texture packs this I absolutely love it same for the crafting area it's got a very very good theme like the rest of it and then on here um if you notice when you hover over stuff it kind of highlights it which I think looks really really Sleek um and it's pretty much the same for the main screen so moving swiftly onwards we have the texture pack Euphoria Euphoria is a really nice texture pack odly um it's looking at it from this it kind of looks very dull but it's actually really really nice texture pack um I think the colors are very nice in it and although they're quite dark they're very cool and the breaking is awesome it's like a circle thing I think that's wicked and if we scmp scrimp whatever over to our little area we've got the crafting bench which I think looks very n I'm sorry but I don't like it I don't like the look of the chest either and pretty much the same for the furnace now I'm not going to commentate of this because it's OB same um basically by the way feel free to send um messages to me uh suggesting a texture pack for me to do because I'll happily do one um and here we go so this is really nice I really like the buttons on it I think they're really cool and it like lights up when you hover over it which I think is a really cool idea pretty much the same for the main menu as is with all of them they're all the same as the inventory s of thing so yeah this is clean clean clean craft which which is really nice I used to love like stuff like this I still do Love Actually where it's very very blocky there's not much texture to it or anything it's just really nice um when you break things once again it's pretty much the same as regular Minecraft which is a bit of a downer because I like new Breaky techniqueyoutube blue suits it very well the chest looks pretty nice but the Brown's a bit Mankey in it and the furnace I really like the furnace I think they've done a very good job with that if we go to the inventory once again it's one of them iffy things when you're not really too sure about the blue with the Browns but you know they also could have done a lot more on this on the like menu pack cuz that's very very very very very plain and the same for the Minecraft main page so moving on swiftly once again we have dku texture pack this is quite well known um a lot of people use this one cuz quite a lot of people like RPG texture packs this is an RPG one where it's like basically looks like an RPG game sort of textures um and breaking on this is pretty much the same as everything else but it's got like a bit more of a less blocky sort of a feel to it it's more of a sort of I don't know how to describe it but you know so back to our working area I think they look really cool the area inside there looks Wicked I really like the connectors um I think they look proper nice and it goes really well because they've kind of followed through the theme on all three of them and they've also done that for the inventory and then the same for the menu as well the oh no yeah they are for the menu they followed the theme and I think it's it's suits it really really well um this is a really good texture pack and as I said a lot of people use it it um RPG fans especially and I think we're on the last one yeah this is bro paint this is probably my favorite texture pack at the minute I love it it's basically an artistic pack where people have done proper really nice stuff like look look when you break this look at that how cool is that I think that's amazing I think that's um a really cool like break I think it's really nice and they look really nice as well the three different things but they could have done more to that that's very basic that's that's a bit of a downside to it um it's not really downside but I'm not as happy with that as I am with everything else well then this is really cool because they kind of like made it look artistic even though it's still very basic they've made it look artistic and exactly the same for the buttons and yeah that's probably my favorite texture pack so this is coming to a close so see you guys later love you all individually feel free to suggest new stuff and comment and subscribe see you guys later"

        "transcript": "hey what's up guys Max here and killer instinct's been out for about a month now and it's had a lot of time to grow in the community and I'm actually really happy with how the game has grown there's been a lot of stuff with matchups that I was kind of worried about and it's all kind of evened itself out and the game's actually turning out to be really freaking interesting with just the six characters that are in it right now but let's talk about one of the other bigger issues of the game and that's what's coming up with the latest content patch and the stuff that I would personally like to see fix with Killer Instinct in its current State one of the biggest priorities in my opinion is something general that has kind of been bugged throughout the entire game ever since it came out and it's the difficulty and the ability to unlock the alternate skins or character colors each character gets up to six different colors that you can't unlock however the bigger issue is that there's a couple of parameters that are pretty difficult to acquire one being 150 fight titles and the other being 50 ranked wins online and right now even if you get 50 ranked wins some accounts do not actually to get the ability to unlock that color it also costs KP as well so it's a pretty big freaking asking price but even so it's still bugged that's something I definitely want to see change because I've almost got 50 ranked wins on every single character in the game right now and I still can't get them so I do want to see a big change there I also think that the requirement to get that is pretty steep there are a lot of people that will never ever ever see 50 wins 50 ranked wins with every character or a very specific character and I'd like that change not everyone is a fighting game pro and that stuff is kind of steep in my opinion so I'd say cutting that in half to 25 might be pretty good and getting 150 fight titles dude that takes a long time to get for any specific character as well I've only actually unlocked it for one and that was saberwolf and I had to play a lot of freaking games to get it I would almost love to see that one cut and half myself uh for myself as well to make it easier on everyone there's also been some pretty big issues that have run into tournament situations when you actually have Xbox ones that are on for a long time it seems that the Xbox one has some somewhat of a heating issue and it actually affects the performance of Killer Instinct every once in a while this is kind of the same effect that Marvel versus Capcom 3 and the street fighter games had playing on PlayStation 3s uh especially in tournament if the systems overheat they cause frame issues and this has actually happened on a multitude of occasions when we've actually gone to tournament during the weeklys where it's like what the hell is going on with this system we end up trying to play on on a different system it happens and I would like to see hopefully something done maybe on the Xbox One's console end but the other big one that I personally would love to see a change for is the overall matchmaking system in Killer Instinct and the ranking I do think that the ranked search options definitely would benefit from you choosing between searching between rank any rank same or rank greater I would love to see that I think that's something that is definitely needed as far as matchmaking you with people that you would actually like to be matchmade with because it is rough and especially in its current state it is very difficult to get higher in rank and Killer Instinct and that's the next change I would love to see is actually rewarding people for playing the game online I have kind of a big issue with with people playing a game and not getting rewarded for continually playing cuz right now in Killer Instinct you can get to a certain Rank and if you play any one of lower ranks you don't get anything at all and it's almost a worthless battle but if you lose you lose a crap ton an absolute truckload of all the time you just put in and it's extremely difficult right now to get into higher ranks anybody that's above a rank 13 is pretty rare and those guys that are even above that it's very hard to do so you kind of have to grind it out like crazy and you have to play people of higher rank but since you can't find those people it gets pretty freaking difficult to actually make progress so hopefully we'll see some progress in that department as well I would also love to see something done about rage quitters sadly rage quitting is still predominant in something like Killer Instinct I don't personally run into it that much in later ranks because a lot of people in later ranks actually put the time in to be good at the game so you don't see it too much but a lot of people that are early on and the ranks get it happening to them all the time and my personal my personal opinion on rage quitting is the fact that I think people that have connections or shoddy connections or get disconnected every once in a while need to take ownership of the fact that their internet is bad and fix it because that ruins the online experience for everybody and I know it's hard to identify whether somebody rage quit or it was unintentional or whatever but I still think you should suffer a loss in that case and I think that the person needs to own up and do something about it you're not going to lose like a billion points or anything but you should lose something you should lose a little bit of your progress just to motivate you that yeah I need to get this fixed this is this is a problem and it'll also take care of Rage quitters in the process and last but not least comes with something that I was expecting with a lot of players of the game getting their hands on it and especially with a game that only had about a Year's life cycle people are already discovering combos that are actually unbreakable and you can't do anything about its guaranteed damage and that kind of breaks the Mantra of Killer Instinct that everything should be breakable to an extent and as of right now there are some characters that can take advantage of very short quick damaging like 20 to 30% damage Combos and some extremely high up to 60% at the cost of a lot of your resources I won't go into detail but a lot of you guys know about the sadira stuff however a lot of these things has already been addressed and we can actually look forward to some things already being acknowledged that is going to be patched within the first big title update of Killer Instinct and the first specific one was that mention from Filthy Rich over at Double Helix that there's General fixes coming the ranking system is going to get an overhaul and I've actually heard in conversation from the guys that were actually working on the ranking system that that stuff is actually going to reward people no matter what for every fight now that every fight that you play will actually give you something that's good I'd like to see what other changes are going to come in store the Killer Instinct store is also going to get some updates as far as unlocks and more so I'm thinking potentially the Killer Instinct store not unlocking things once you get 50 ranked wins you know and stuff like that is actually already going to get fixed but we'll see what actually does happen when this patch launches and as soon as it does I'll have a detailed list for you guys to check out but these are the things I would personally like seeing change to KI the overall experience is really good there's some small things here and there that kind of like you know are iffy between some of the issues online where a game desync every like one out of a 100 games and I've seen it happen a couple of times now and it totally is a thing and it's very obvious that it is happening but luckily I've heard that that stuff is totally being addressed in the new in the new patch update that's coming as well so like I said dude stay tuned as soon as it's officially out I'll have a full detailed list on what exactly has been updated as far as the game and the overall General fixes for KI what would you like to see changed for Killer Instinct right now since we've got about a month to play with the game my name is Max ailan and stay tuned guys the there be more coming very soon"

        "transcript": "hi everyone it's me tat and this is a kind of preview of what I'm gonna probably call tips from tat so it's a good little way for me to give tips from my explorations in cosplay and getting everything done to make it look as accurate and fun as possible and so today I'm gonna be talking about dyeing synthetic wigs because I had my first adventure with that today which was very fun so I had this wig that I needed to have be purple and as you guys probably have noticed if you've ever searched for wigs online is that purple is not a very easy shade to find so what I did find is this blonde wig right there and after about an hour's worth of labor I have this purple wig and so now you guys are probably asking okay well that's great but how did you do it well there's a few things that you need you need rubber gloves otherwise you're gonna get dye all over your hands you need a clear plastic spray bottle the dollar store is your friend you also need rubbing alcohol 70% they might have it at the Dollar Tree or not but it's always worth it to look you're also going to need a hairdryer with a low setting you do not want to use a high setting on a synthetic wig otherwise you will melt the fibers you also need acrylic ink not acrylic paint acrylic ink they come in little bottles like this and they range from about five to seven dollars depending on where you buy it at art supply stores I used a just a dark purple for my wig and as you can see even with the dark purple it's kind of a lighter shade of how it turned out and what you want to do is the ratio for the dye is going to be for every cup of alcohol you're going to use eight squirts of ink and some of the acrylic inks don't have little squeeze tops and if that happens just do your best guesstimate I mean it looks pretty opaque when you mix it all together and you want to make sure that it's shaken pretty well before you start you want to be preferably outside because you don't want dye to get everywhere wear clothes that you wouldn't mind getting completely ruined because if you wear your favorite t-shirt you know and you get purple dial over then it's probably not gonna be your favorite t-shirt anymore and so what you want to do is you want to start spraying at the roots at the top of the wig and as you spray you want to use the hairdryer to keep it from dripping because as I found out if it drips all the dye seeps down to the ends and then the top is left pretty much undyed also a key thing is you cannot die a wig lighter than the color it is started with so you can't take a black wig and diet red the most you'll get is a red tint I noticed when dyeing my blonde wig that depending on how I sprayed the dye I could cause streaks or tips so if your character say has bleached blonde hair with brown tips or pink tips you could use the spray bottle to only get the tips getting just the roots might be a little bit harder because it drips and when you're spraying the wig you want to make sure that dries completely and then from where I've read they say anywhere from four to eight hours you need to wait and have it dry and then you run it with clear cold water until the water runs clear and then you have to let it dry completely again and then that's it and you have a dyed wig so one of the other interesting tips I found out is in doing such a drastic change from blonde to purple a good trick is to turn the wig upside down so that you see all the little roots right there and you can spray it upside down or even spray it through the wig cap so you get all of where the roots are coming in so that you won't have it peeking through when you're wearing the wig so hopefully my trials and errors will help you dye your wig with efficiency and it will not have any problem so good luck and have fun making your costumes"

        "transcript": "what up everybody it's me blake316 and in this video i'm doing a bit of a comparison almost the truth pretty much the truth because i'm saying it with that being said a lot of people try to compare the wii u versus the xbox one and the playstation 4 graphically basically how the games look and let's be honest here the xbox one is leaps and bounds hardware wise better than the wii u it's an overall more powerful console but a lot of people make this argument that xbox one has better graphics based on really nothing very few people own multiple consoles right now a lot of people go on youtube or other websites and see videos of these games in action and to be honest with you youtube videos with these current generation consoles and like pc gaming it's strictly good enough to show you the game play of the game other than that graphics serve no purpose whatsoever in these videos there's a lot of pc uh guys out there who make a benchmark video showing how impressive their gaming rigs are now and how good quote unquote they can make their games look on there but truth to the reality is on youtube i personally and i'm sure i'm not the only person who sees a difference like honestly people show these impressive gaming pcs and how and what these uh they can do with these games but when they upload it to youtube i don't know it's a goddamn thing you could say that was a playstation 4 game i don't even know the difference youtube doesn't render these games to look like their true value of how good they really look being that i have all these consoles i can give you an honest opinion and a lot of people might say it's a fanboy opinion but a fanboy of what if i have all these consoles what do i benefit of bashing one console over the other now let's just say this i said xbox one is the more powerful console but at the end of the day my opinion the truth wii u has better graphics than the xbox one i mean let's be honest here owning games like titanfall dead rising three titanfall is an amazing game it's a system seller i recommend it to anyone it will be my top five games for 2014. but graphically i was not even close to being impressed with this game it does not look great the graphic the graphics are subpar in my opinion the textures are nothing amazing the graphics the game just doesn't look all that great in my opinion dead rising 3 another game it's a good game but graphically it's nothing impressive i mean i'm honestly not blown away by dead rising 3. i'm not i don't know what it is but meanwhile xbox one has this more powerful console now in contrast to the wii u super mario 3d world donkey kong country tropical freeze just to name a few look way better than any game on the xbox one the wii u right now has better graphics than the xbox one now you can say well the wii u games are not graphically demanding they're not they're not as graphically demanding as the xbox one but at that same time xbox one can support the graphically demanding games and it fails at it with the wii u it stays within its boundaries and makes amazing looking games for i can honestly tell you donkey kong tropical freeze looks better than titanfall it looks better than dead ryzen 3. it looks better than any game on the xbox one i can honestly say if you see mario kart 8 the game looks better than most playstation 4 games right now and i'm not gonna go so crazy i can't stand what like nintendo fanboys say oh it looks like a pixar movie no the it does not like don't get beside yourself don't get that ahead of yourself it does nothing looks like a pixar movie on any console but the wii u has better graphics than the xbox one right now and i'm making this video because a lot of people say oh what system looks better or what system should i get the wii u has better looking games right now in my opinion and i can judge this opinion because i have these consoles i have nothing to benefit from lying to people the wii u just has better games like donkey kong country returns tropical freeze has friggin like beautiful colors depth to it it has details the game looks really damn good and these games are like 10 80 60 frames per second compared to the xbox one or the graphics just aren't that great a lot of people might have a hard time like admitting to the fact but the truth is it is what it is wii u currently has better graphics than xbox one so what i let people know about it now a lot of people might get a little butter right now you know they might uh take some tylenol ibuprofen to help that soreness in their ass but oh bro hopefully you take a little nap and get over it with me bite three on six sharing some views and thoughts with you guys until next time peace make sure to follow me on twitter instagram as well as facebook appley316"

        "transcript": "hey guys as you can see this is gen 5. um what i've noticed as my start through gen 5 is pretty much that weather teams dominate what i've pretty much put together is a team that counters most weather teams quite well i'm not sure i'm not sure how well it does with stahl so i don't know this is a trick room team it's not really a form of weather because i've never been in trick room physically because that's not possible you know he leads off with a dragonite i'm not very sure on what he's going to do here so i'm just going to lead off with the ice beam on porygon 2 because if if he really stays in ice cream is going to do quite a bit even though he's quite bulky i'm going to ice beam and the victini gets the hit but he gets freeze hacks so he's frozen solid i get a free turn to set up trick room and then switch out as i switch out i'm i decide to go into my special attack sweeper this is a rengarusu with life orb and it's got the ability called regeneration which gives it one third hp whenever it switches in he goes knowing a toray which is which are pretty annoying because they're generally bulky as heck it's got a great typing of steel grass except for the whole super effective four times super effective fire but you win some you lose some um thanks to rank producers pretty great move pool it gets focus blast so i decide that i'm not gonna have any of what that natori has given me and i'm just gonna focus blast it away i know that this dragonite will not die to a single psychic even though i am life or max special attack he goes to the draco meteor which of course it's going to take me out i'm not defensive at all but whatever this team was pretty much just based around three support three sweepers as you'll see as it turns out my support lived the longest my sweepers died really fast porygon z i mean porygon 2 was a champ this whole match if you guys didn't know porygon 2 is holding something called the evolution stone which gives him a 1.5 boost to his defenses and he's gonna this dragonite's a mixed dragonite meaning that he has special attacks and regular attacks and now that his special attack is dropped he's pretty much dependent on those regular attacks to do anything i noticed that he's life orb so he's pretty much killing himself as he's barely chipping away at my hp i carry recover so i'm not worried this turn i fear that he's going for something else so i decide to even though i'm at full hp i'm just going to thunderbolt him just to get rid of him this burungaru um this is a pretty good counter to my team um they're pretty scary because they carry toxic and recover they're pretty much a porygon too water that's water ghost that carries toxic um this thing actually toxics like half of my support mons which is kind of lame but whatever they live long enough kurimugan which is translated and it changed into krimgan lately i don't really know it's a mold breaker i could have the ability called encourage which boosts attacks with secondary effects but i'd rather have the ability to earthquake just about anything as dimensions twist back to normal i decide to go for the outrage because it's stabbed and krimgon has a pretty good base attack victini gets death foddered um whatever that's cool he gets to see that i have a life orb so he goes into kajando which i'm afraid of because i'm not sure what it what it what kind of kajando it is they could be regeneration u-turn cajandos or they could be reckless and reckless boosts their uh attacks with high recoil so i'm a little scared of that here i didn't really get to see what kind it was off to be off the bat there just because i know crime guns got pretty bad defenses but as dusk klopp's receives that u-turn and he takes it like a champ i decide to set up another trick room i knew that i could set up that free trick room there because kajandos are fighting types and pretty much most of their moves just don't touch dust claps at all the only thing that i have to be afraid of is payback which isn't an issue he gets another toxic on one of my support mods i'm not too worried dust collapse can take just about anything like a champ he's got pain split for quick revive not quick revive i'm talking cod here um he's for quick hp i decide he's going to get out of there so i can get some damage done to this blue anger before he can recover all my damage off he just recover on the first turn here i know that with reputation i can stone edge him to death eventually because hammer arm mock punch and facade don't do anything to him i'm a guts reputation which is pretty great ability on this guy who's special defensive bulky as you'll see here he just absorbs his hit quite well um this guy's pretty much evs are in hp special defense and attack straight up he can pretty much absorb most special defensive i mean special attacks at least one of them i go for the second stone edge there to take out the uh burungeru the reason that why i have stone edges because it pretty much can take out anything that i'm afraid of in one to two hits thanks to its high crit rate and thanks to guts with its great 1.5 multiplier i go into dust clops knowing that if he goes for the high jump kick or the fake out either the high jump kick will do a ton of recoil to him or the fake out just won't touch him so he goes for the high jump kick it misses he slams into the ground so that pretty much sucks for him he gets a ton of his own damage done to himself um he goes for the payback here which i didn't see coming at first but i take that really well seeing as dusk claps also has a great base defense plus the evolution stone just makes him a huge wall i go for the pain split expecting the switch out pretty much i'm death fodder here so i'm not afraid to switch out i feel that i fear that he's going to go for another payback here i know that i can take that with slow king decently well um it gets me down into yellow but his life worked i'm pretty much just trying to stall this kajando out because it is probably one of the scariest things that i can face right now i still have trick room up but i'm just kind of switching around to see what i can bring this thing down to i know it's going to go for the u-turn this turn to take out my well it's going to try to take out my slow king there i know that porygon 2 can absorb that hit just like a champ kajando gets brought down to maybe like negative six hp zero work comes out i'm not too sure about zoroark because this is one of my first black and white battles a little scared of those guys i didn't know what it was i'm just happy it didn't come out disguised as something else the other match i had one transform into a hip out on and it used nasty plot and i was like what the balls is that i go for the thunderbolt after i check room knowing that i get the free attack off before he death fodders me i'm not too worried about that porygon 2 did its job this match he tanked revolution comes in i'm going to go for the mock punch just in case he's got some priority that i've never heard of i'm still learning all the moves all the new moves from gen 5 so bear with me if i pronounce something wrong say something wrong or say something wrong about something i'm trying um i go for the mock punch again just in case he's carrying fake out i don't really know who'd go first there in that condition but still it was a great battle if you liked it comment rate and subscribe thanks guys see you later"

        "transcript": "[Music] what is going on gaming Nation my name is Mr Studley and this is a bit of a news update a news update on Borderlands the Pre-Sequel now I know a lot of you have been uh speculating on what clap trap's new uh action skill or his new ability is going to be and um I'm uh subscribed to this guy morning after kill and it was on his Channel that I first uh saw the speculation of clap trap being a uh Interstellar ninja was a pretty interesting concept uh due to the fact that one of his class mods in one of the uh newer trailers uh the behind the scenes one claimed uh well the class mode was titled uh I think it was Interstellar ninja something of the form and then there was a part in the uh Moon dance trailer which is where I'm getting this new information or maybe not new information you'll find out soon enough um it was in this Moon dance trailer that uh all four characters were showing off their action skills in one uh specific moment and I mean I'll show that for you right now I mean if you haven't uh already picked up on that rumor and though all four characters were showing off their action skills it was a clap trap that uh kind of just squint into this uh weird ninja is pose which was uh very reminiscent of what he did at the end of the uh I think it was the clap traps Robo Revolution DLC something of the sort for the original Borderlands uh which is why people have been speculating he's going to be some kind of 0er 2.0 or you know something of the sorts um but anyway with that news aside when me and my friend today we um I've made this uh little program cuz I do dabble in coding a bit I made this uh new program for myself to use um and I mean if it interests you when I'm done I mean when I'm done with it I I was thinking I could kind of uh just put it on the internet for free for some people to use um it's basically this uh program that allows Gamers to budget for their games it's a program designed to do uh to allow you to you know one budget for a game you know uh have all your uh funds and check your balances constantly with your money and stuff it allows you to uh check the release date for old new games coming up uh it allows you to check out trailers and stuff um it's just this uh isolated program just designed for gamers to uh know everything about their games in one uh singular Spot while at the same time uh manage funds for their games and stuff it it also has accessories for consoles and whatnot um but that's not the main point of this video main point being is that um I I I was watching the uh trailer on the program that I made the moon trailer and my friend spotted this clip right right here um as you can see uh I'm going to try zoom in here I'm hoping it's a bit a little clear to you guys but clap trap is currently he's jumping Zerg and he is shooting he's shooting uh his gun I don't know what gun it is but it's obviously probably just any randomly generated gun in uh in Borderlands sorry my phone just went off randomly generated gun in Borderlands but he's shooting it at what looks to be the uh scabs I can't exactly tell if those are the scav enemies but I mean it looks to be a scav and like if you look right here um and you've probably seen it a couple times cuz I'm I'm replaying this over and over but there's this heart explosion heart explosion that occurs on one of these enemies and I don't know if this is maybe an action skill or just one of these passive abilities or something that are on his skill tree but it does add to the information surrounding these specul ations on clap trap's abilities now whether or not this is has anything to do with his action skill or if it's just a skill on his uh skill tree this is still very important to those of us who are speculating on clap trap's ability in the prequel and like if this information has already been found and if it's already been reported on I haven't seen it uh I'm just being blunt here I haven't seen it if it has been reported on which is why I'm making this video for the Borderlands Community for people like more F to kill who may come across this video and maybe reporting it cuz I mean they're they're bigger YouTubers and like it's cool if this information gets out to everyone you know um but hey I mean if this is already been found uh well I mean that's cool uh and if you're one of those like me who didn't know about it and found out from this video that's cool too I just wanted to get the word out there that this may or may not be new information um and I'm I'm pretty sure it's new information like this I I I haven't seen this and I mean the moon dance trailer is pretty old and I'm pretty sure people have dissected this thing uh frame by frame but uh yeah that that's all I have for you here today um okay well that's it for me I've been Mr Studley and this has been a new update or something for the shorts I'll check your Gamers next time holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] I'm dodging him I'm dodging him come on just a little bit more just a little bit more oh yeah that's right this is how an ultimate M what the hell are these guys I've never fought one of these before [\u00a0__\u00a0] [Music]"

        "transcript": "okay now that we've reviewed how to build massive biceps to burst the sleeves of your t-shirt let's look at balancing out that with massive triceps we're going to start with the close grip bench press para mating up the weight with each of five sets ten reps ten reps then eight then six then six hey you want mass right alright then the next exercise is the bench dip where we'll do three sets of perfectly executed reps ten each then we'll demonstrate the seated EZ bar French press three sets pair meeting down each set with six reps at first then eight then ten push yourself start heavy whenever you pyramid down as you will with the fourth exercise the rope press down where we'll do three sets at eight reps then 10 then 10 reps again or until failure the close grip bench press is an excellent mass building compound exercise for the beginning of your triceps workout move through these reps when you're fresh and you can handle a little bit more weight before your triceps are fatigued with isolation exercises the key here is to slide your hands inward a bit and grip the bar with your hands narrower than shoulder width apart find a comfortable spot where you can balance the bar with certainty and not overcompensate with the rest of your body begin by lying on your benchpress station with your head shoulders and gluts resting on the bench and a slight arch in your lumbar spine the barbell should be racked above you and an accessible height directly above your head if you don't have access to a rack have your spotter give you a lift off grabbing the bar palms up press it up to release it and lock your arms directly above your chest this is your starting position inhale slightly more than usual and hold your breath as you lower the bar to your chest as you come close to touching your pecs reverse direction decisively and press the bar back up do not stop or pause in the bottom position because that will bring in your pecs more than you want but that doesn't mean you bounce off your chest either push steadily upward and as you reach the top exhale and lock your elbows pause a moment at the extended position before beginning your next rep continue at a moderate rate of speed remembering not to arch your back with each lift if you find yourself arching lighten up on your weights with strip form keeping your elbows close to your sides during both ascent and descent this will be a great mass builder for you so watch the elbows the back and the width of your grip and you'll be on your way the bench dip is one of the few compound exercises that's known for its pump as much as it's gross stimulation your pecs and anterior deltoids will contract strongly at the beginning of the up phase but if you keep your elbows pointed back and close to your body your triceps will be doing the majority of the work start by placing two benches parallel to each other about two and a half or three feet apart sit like this on the middle of one bench placing your hands by your hips fingers cupping the edge of the bench and your elbows pointing directly rearward now support your body and straight arms and place your feet on to the other bench inhale as you bend your elbows to slowly lower your upper body between the benches until you feel a stretch in your triceps and shoulders after you reach the bottom position hold your breath and push yourself upward until your arms are fully extended you can lock your elbows if you want here as long as you don't overextend exhale at this position when you get to the top pause for a second and slowly lower yourself and work methodically through your reps you want to keep your eyes and focus directly forward throughout this exercise some performance tips on this if you're a beginner or if you've never done this exercise before keep your range of motion short before gradually increasing the depth of your dip work into it for those who want extra resistance as their practice develops have a partner place a weight plate on your thighs but if you're going to double or triple up on plates make sure that your partner hangs on to them to prevent them from slipping and helps take them off at the end of each set here we've got another excellent triceps movement and I'm going to give you a rule to emblazon into your mind throughout this exercise keep your elbow stationary and pointed toward the ceiling at all times straddle your exercise bench with your feet flat on the floor grasping your barbell keep your torso erect and your eyes looking directly forward bend your elbows and raise your arms overhead allowing your forearm and the bar to hang down behind your head so your elbows point where were you listening that's right directly upward toward the ceiling now inhale slightly more than usual hold that breath during the up phase and keeping your upper arm stationary press the bar upward until your arms are fully extended your little fingers should point forward ensuring that you are using a neutral grip remember not to round your back or lean forward which decreases the impact of the exercise as well as who puts excessive stress on your vertebra and shoulder joints when you hit the peak point in the movement lock your arms for an even stronger contraction of the triceps so always be careful not to overextend your joints and have I mentioned this keep your elbows pointed toward the ceiling the whole time you now let's head back to the gym and see how the rope press down is done with a rope press down you can really pack on the mask if you isolate your triceps with immaculate form stand in front of a high cable pulley and grasp the rope attachment with a neutral or palms and grip your feet should be parallel or if you want one foot can be slightly in front of the other lean forward from the waist to more than about 10 to 15 degrees and position your elbows slightly in front of your body with your hands at approximately shoulder height take note the slight forward position of your elbows is key to this exercise keeping your elbows at your sides and your upper arms and torso motionless inhale slightly more than usual and hold your breath as you push down with your hands if you want to get a little extra contraction out of your triceps twist your palms fully downward as you execute the press down you'll feel the difference especially as you pass the 90 degree position push those palms down pulling the ropes apart slightly as you reach the bottom straighten your arms fully then exhale as you return to the initial position under control where your forearms are just past parallel to the floor keep a firm grip through the movement so that your hands and forearms remain in a straight line at all times to pull maximum efficiency here remember to maintain a motionless torso and motionless upper arm position at all times during the execution both on the push down and the ascent back up you"

        "transcript": "hi guys it's jamie and today i'm going to show you how i did this look on my eyes it's kind of like a natural smokey eye look that i do on myself i like it because it's kind of smoky and gray but it's also kind of like bright where my eyes don't look too small there's a lot of light colors and there's really not that many colors involved um so this is kind of like an everyday look i'll wear this at night maybe even during the day too but it's a pretty simple natural but yet kind of smoky look so i did a little bit of a pinker cheek and a nude lip to go with it and um yeah so let's get started into the tutorial so the first thing i'm going to do is take my mac 227 brush which looks like this and naked lunch which is this pretty frosted neutral pink color and i'm just going to get that all over my brush like this and just pat it onto my lid and going a little bit into the crease and making sure i really get it in this corner here so once you have all that padded on i'm going to take a pencil brush looks like this and i'm going to take the same color the naked lunch dab this in and take it underneath my eye just like this on the lower lash line this will really help reflect light and make your eyes look a lot bigger and then i'm going to make sure i get it up in here really well too on this on this inner corner then i'm going to take um another pencil brush this is also by mac it was just a little special edition one and i like this one because it's a lot more rounded than this one i use this on my other eye that's why it's dirty but it's a lot more rounded this one's a lot more pointed so i'm going to take this pencil brush into my scene eyeshadow which looks like this it's kind of like a bluish purplish gray so i'm just going to take my brush into it like that tap off any excess and then i'm going to take this on the outer part of my lower lash line and then i'm going to bring it up towards my eyebrow just kind of drawing a line and slowly working this a little bit at a time it's okay if this line looks a little bit weird we're gonna blend that end now we're just gonna take this color down and i don't have a lot of space like in between my eyebrow and my lid especially when my eyes are open just like that so you may need to just adjust how you do this a little bit like you may not need to take it up kind of like i am but i want to create that shape so now i'm just going to take this down once i have that little wing i'm just going to take this stila brush it's the number 30 and i like this end of it and i'm just going to dip a little bit of this into the scene and i'm just going to work and blending this into the outer corner of my eye and into my crease a little bit once you're done blending you should have something that kind of looks a little bit like this just kind of smoky but kind of neutral so now we're just going to take the blending one step further and i'm going to take a matte color called kid by mac and it looks like this and i'm just going to dip a 217 brush into the tip of this and then i'm going to take it over this just to kind of blend everything in into my crease and up to my brow bone just so there's no real harsh lines or anything so now just to deepen this outer color just a tiny bit more i'm going to take print by mac which is kind of like a darker gray color get it on that same fluffier brush just drag this along the very outer corner of my lash line and then onto my upper lash line so now i'm going to line my eye with the makeup forever aqua eyes and it's this gray color i got this in a little set i guess it's the color 21l but it really doesn't have a color name uh maybe because i got this in like a little set but i'm just going to use this pencil to line my upper lash line and my upper tight line and i start at the middle of my lash line work my way out i like to wing it up a little bit and draw it into just right about here so once you have a nice line kind of drawn like that just a little bit of a wing i'm going to take my trish mcevoy precision eyeliner brush which looks like this and i'm going to dip it into some print eyeshadow by mac and i'm just gonna tap this on the top to seal in my eyeliner and to fill in any little spaces that i may have missed along my lash line you can also take this under your lash line here if you want some added definition okay so then we have that now i'm going to take the same eyeliner i used for up here and just do my tight line just by looking up and ever so lightly lining the top of that i'm going to be doing my bottom waterline and a little bit of the makeup forever aqua eyes in this champagne color which is 23l and it's a lot similar to the mac naked lunch and it looks really pretty with this kind of gray color and i like to keep my bottom waterline kind of light so that my eyes look awake and open i tend to feel like they look too small if i use too dark of a color my eyes look too small so i'm going to use this and just tilt my head down and line my bottom water waterline and then i'm just going to take a little bit of this and draw it onto my inner bottom lash line just for some added shine now i'm just going to curl my lashes and put on some mascara and then i'll tell you how i finished this look so for cheeks i kind of did a lot i used the mac cream base and so sweet and so easy just because i thought a bright pink kind of against the grays and this kind of neutral eye look it would be nice to have like a pop of pink so i used this cream base and then over it i used um the mac well dressed blush which is this one right here so pretty light pink and then um just for kind of a contour i use the personal style beauty powder brush that came out with the all ages all races all sexist line by mac it looks like this it's just like a really kind of neutral color and then for my lips i used creme de nude by mac and this ysl lip gloss and golden gloss it looks like this so that's it i hope you guys enjoyed this pretty simple smokey eye tutorial and i will talk to you all very soon"

        "transcript": "hi my gorgeous makeup geeks it is summertime and with that comes the time to get all bronzed and glowy so I wanted to do how to apply bronzer today now I plan my bronzer a lot different than some makeup artists do I do it more I have a contouring method so I'll show you that in a second but let's talk about bronzers real quick one of the best ones on the market it's super expensive though is that girl on one and they have what's called four seasons and it has four different colors for fair skin up to medium or even dark skin the cost of this is around 70 something dollars so I'm not gonna recommend us just because it is so expensive but it is an amazing bronzer very smooth matte finish the one I'm going to use today though is the NARS one and I'm using Casino and it's this color right here you guys can see that it's great for medium skin if you have fair skin another good one by NARS would be the NARS Laguna and an inexpensive one that's great for fair skin is the Sephora sculpting dis you guys have seen me use this a lot of videos you can tell this as a dent in it but it's the sculpting disc and has a bronzer here and it's kind of as a peachy shade to it know if you guys can see that but it's great for fair skin because it doesn't look dirty it's not to oranjee it's a beautiful color so anyways let's get onto the application I'm going to use the Mac 109 brush and I love it because this rounded tip gets right under the cheekbones where I want it so I'm going to use the NARS casino dip it in there and pick up just a little bit of bronzer if you haven't done this before and you feel that this may be dark tap off a little excess on the back of your hands you don't apply too much making your face look dirty so what I'm going to do is apply it here under the cheekbones so what you can do is make a fishy face and apply it under here and what I do is I start blending it up onto the cheeks so I'm not going to wear any blush today I'm just going to wear bronzer but I apply it here to get most of the color here under the cheekbone and then I blend it upwards to kind of fade it up and you see how it just gives a very nice sun-kissed glow to the cheek so there's that side here's one without it then you can take a bit more and put it here up on the temple so blend it upwards and you can even take a bit and put it just at the top of your forehead near the hairline because the Sun generally hits up here and it's gonna make it just a little bit darker come on here get out of the way so anyways that's all where I put my bronzer is just under the cheekbones like that and then if you want just a little bit down here you can put just a bit under the chin and along the jawline and it's just gonna kind of contour your face just a little bit but that is all that you need to apply a bronzer now I know a lot of makeup artists will tell you to go down the nose the forehead and what not you can do that if your bronzer is light enough but generally you want to when you get a bronzer you kind of want to look a little darker you want to look like you have a suntan and so I don't recommend playing a darker shade all over your forehead nose and cheekbones because then it's darkening those spots and making them look a little muddy that's just my opinion do it how you want but that's how I apply bronzer so hope that was helpful for you guys go to makeup geek comm I will have an extensive review on a ton of different bronzers prices which ones best for different skin types so check it out but thanks for watching guys be happy and healthy and enjoy your summer and I will talk to you guys soon bye"

        "transcript": "in the previous video we looked at how we can get this flash off the camera and move it around to get more creative and compelling images now we use these cactus version 4 wireless triggers now we've got here our transmitter and our receiver now if you haven't watched part one of this series of off camera flash do that now and learn a bit more about these units as you will need them to get this mobile studio on the go now what we did was we put this on the camera and we had this on the flash and when you press the shutter button on your camera it sends a signal to the flash and the flash will also fire even if it's not connected to the camera which is super cool now today we're going to look at the light stands now if you look here here we've got a light duty light stand and this will now hold our flash and our cactus triggers it will go on here and there's also a hole here where we'll put our light modifier which will be an umbrella now i've got two light stands and this is a heavy duty light stand you'll notice this one is is slightly thinner than this one and this one is also much heavier now they basically do exactly the same thing they've got the same knobs yet you can make the thing longer or make it smaller again it's basically the same thing and you will find every now and then there'll be new models so it will change as well but it's still a light stand and that's that's what it will do in the end of the day now the smaller one the light duty one i won't recommend for using outdoors because this thing is a bit flimsy it's perfect for indoors taking it to a client or just your home studio it's perfect but if you want to go on location and do work outside if it's windy i'll recommend this one because you'll see when it's there it's standing strong and the wind can blow on this thing and okay obviously i won't have an umbrella on this thing when the wind's playing because it will just blow the entire thing over but you can have your flash on here and you can just use it without a light modifier but i'm afraid this one will just blow over if you take this maybe to the strand or something and the wind's blowing strong it's going to blow this thing over so rather than go for the heavy duty one if you look at your brackets now here we've got a bracket and you'll see that there's a knob here that you can turn this thing to make it go forward or backwards this is that you can move your light modifier around or if you just want to move your flash up or down this is very nice now when you look for these brackets you'll notice again there's new ones all all the time and you won't necessarily find this exact model but they all do exactly the same thing but there's a few things you need to look for when you buy these it's handy if it can do this but most of the time they will that they can move up and down the umbrella now you'll put your umbrella through this hole right here it'll basically look like this and you will take the umbrella and just put it in there you'll notice the umbrella can move around now there's here on this side you can't see now there's a little screw that i can tighten and then the umbrella is fastened and it can't fall out it's nice to look for that little screw there because sometimes it doesn't have one and then your umbrella can just move around the entire time and in the same at the top here you'll see if i take this umbrella out now if i put my um flash on here i'm going to put my trans or my receiver on here you'll notice that this will screw you as well if i fasten this then this thing can't fall out now i've seen it happen a lot of the times and then you've got an expensive flash on here especially if you're buying the the more expensive like the four 5000 flashes you don't want this thing to fall off here so now you can have the flash sturdy and strong on this cactus receiver and then the receiver is forced into the tripod then you know this thing is not going anywhere it's not going to fall off so that's things i look for when i buy a bracket is that they've got these screws that i can fasten everything i know my equipment is safe on my light stand and that's basically it now if you want to learn more about using these light stands and the flashes and the triggers you can look at our website at www.mwest.com or just follow the link on the screen and then just go to the top and click on training and scroll down to the bottom to the creative lighting course it's a full day course and we it's also a class of only maximum four people so everyone will have time to play and we do light setups and studio setups and then we use these light stands and everything practically so you can learn to use this and it's a day full of fun if you want to buy one of these light stands camera world has got a very nice deal where you get your light duty light stand as well as your hot shoe bracket and your umbrella and currently it's 695 and you can contact them at the details below now in the next video we are going to look at flashes and different kinds so that we can start to put this mobile studio together see you in the next episode"

        "transcript": "what's up guys and girls my name is super Rebel 123 so in today's video we do have a video packed full of both GTA 5 news and GTA online and about the new info just in about possibly having a single player DLC then secondly about GTA online no longer being static and lastly when Rockstar North's art director Aaron Garett gets interviewed he goes into talking about how having free players or character should I say in GTA 5 actually paid off so yeah it's going to be a pretty awesome video so starting off with of rumor going around about GTA 5 possibly having a single player DLC so recently several players apparently found files hinting at a new DLC single player campaign missions for GTA 5 on both the PS3 and Xbox 360 so the rumor suggest that multiple assassination missions will be added to single player campaign of GTA 5 however one of the job descriptions may have given away the findings as a hoax now one of the mission involves setting up a Facebook account now as we all know Facebook doesn't really entirely exist in the GTA world I guess you could say but Rockstar as we all know did set up life inv Vader which is more or less just their version of Facebook anyway so Rockstar haven't entirely announced the specific details regarding the planned DLC for single player because the publisher appears to be more focus at adding new expansions to GTA online as well as patching up the remaining exploits so yeah this rumor does seem to be going around everywhere but we haven't seen any images or print screens or whatever you want to say of these files so we can't be 100% % sure but as soon as we do get to see these files I will share it with you guys straight away and keep you updated so moving on to the next piece of news about GTA online no longer being static now what this means is fan feedback basically SL suggestions will be taken on board from Rockstar now speaking with Eric Garber he actually confirmed that content was cut along the way and certain ideas were pushed to the background this is because they were actually getting close to the release date and it was just too much to add in in a little amount of time which does pretty much make sense anyway so Garber added as a group of people we are never sure to fight theirs there are always things that come up during development that you want to add often we do but the closer you get to release the less that happens I don't feel like the game fell short but there is undoubtedly a huge volume of plans and ideas that we wanted to do to push it further what I love about our GTA online plans is that the game is no longer static he added we can continue to add these things and involve that's even more exciting these days we're through the fors Reddit Etc we have real direct connection to the people playing the game we can respond to what they are into and what they hate more than ever it's something that really suits the way we work the way we are always trying to adapt the experience and avoid walking blindly down a set path so I think this is actually generally pretty awesome that Rockstar are taking on fan feedback and stuff because if you watch my previous video about the heist and stuff we can always submit more ideas to them that they could possibly add into Heist missions or or just GTA online in general like if you wouldd like to see more animals for instance I have no idea but the more they of course get asked the same question the more likely it is to be added into the game now if you guys would like to submit an idea to Rockstar Games you can do this by emailing GTA online rockstargames.com or you could just simply go over to Reddit and submit an idea over there since they are more or less on there all the time anyway but yeah overall I think this is a pretty cool thing that Rockstar are doing because it does interact with fans and having a lot of people's feedback and ideas will just overall make a better experience in GTA Online and GTA 5 and plus everyone's ideas will fit somewhere into the game anyway so yeah I think it is great what they are doing but I want you guys to tell me what you think on this down in the comments below so moving on to the last bit of news in today's video so in a new interview on the making of the game with Edge magazine Aaron Garber explained that while the idea was fair from for GTA 5's conception it was a massive change to the core of the series and therefore a big risk for Rockstar so garbet does say multiple characters was a leap of faith it was an interesting idea and it felt like we could do interesting things with it but it also felt like a change to the core of the game that might backfire I think it really worked out it's so hard during development to get perspective you get so used to looking for the problems that it becomes almost impossible to step back and see the positives and then like I told you guys earlier Gara also went on to reveal how somewhat apparently Rockstar North had to dis guard a huge volume of plans and ideas that the team wanted to include to push the game further for Garber the ability to make changes to the living breathing world of GTA online sues any frustration at the inability to involve the single player experience of GTA 5 further so yeah there it is Garber is saying that overall having the three characters in GTA 5 was a leap of faith it was a really good thing cuz it did turn out well for them and in my opinion I think having fre players in the game was pretty awesome but yeah he's saying that he won to add more things into the game like the rest of the crew did but there wasn't enough time but the good news on this is about all that stuff will probably be chucked into DLCs and all that good stuff which is meant to be coming this year so if that is something to look forward to but guys that's it for today's video I hope you enjoyed it as always if you did be sure to punch that like button guys it would be really appreciated if we can get this video to 50 plus likes and if you guys are new to this channel thank you for stopping by please do hit that subscribe button below for more news and stuff like this all that good stuff it would be really appreciated and yeah I want you guys to tell me down in the comments below what do you think about Rockstar actually adding people's idea into the game and was having free plays in GTA 5 good for you be sure to tell me down in the comments Below guys and I will see you in my next video but until then adios amigos"

        "transcript": "hi I'm rich Bergman from ideas for deckd designs.com and I'm here to give you another great tip on how to build better-looking longer lasting decks easier and faster than ever before before the Titan deck foot your footing options for ground level decks or traditional underground concrete footings concrete blocks or ground spikes let me explain each one of these underground concrete footings are the gold standard in construction that's why we use them on buildings and residential homes and other large construction projects but it's expensive it takes days to complete it's brutally tough work and it's not needed for the vast majority of residential decks concrete blocks sit higher off the ground so you can't set your frame as low to the ground unless you dig a hole level it and back fill around the block they aren't anchored to the ground so you can't use them in a lot of area where there's a lot of wind high wind or tornadoes because of the risk of them getting lifted up and launched through the air like a cannonball the joists or posts sit in grooves they aren't secure so again a potential safety risk in high wind areas they also only hold a 4x4 post not a 6x6 post and most of the industry is moving towards 6x6 post for a full host of reasons they also have a relatively small surface area so you'll have to use more of them to distribute the same amount of weight on any given deck they don't look too good if they're highly visible depending upon your deck project but the one positive is that they are quite uh inexpensive some people use traditional ground spikes like this one that you might see in a fence application others are more reinforced and have a load plate to distribute weight but you have to use a sledgehammer or a jackhammer to install them and that intimidates a lot of people and if they go in crooked it's really difficult to pull them out and reinstall and because they're higher off the ground it's difficult to set your framing as low to the ground as you might like they tend to be a little higher off the ground for lowlevel decks the Titan deck foot gets around all these problems it uses either a 6x6 bracket or a 4x4 bracket and you'll notice that the saddle is lower to the ground allowing you to put framing much lower to the ground yet still stay dry and safe it's just another reason why the tighten deck foot will make your life so much easier when it comes to building your backyard getaway the Titan deck foot really is an amazing product and it's going to make your life so much easier available now at ideas for deckd designs.com and coming soon to building supply stores near you"

        "transcript": "welcome to another edition of Designing spaces the show that's all about you and your space your home and surroundings I'm Debbie Marie and I'm David Jones on today's show we look at some of the new technology that goes into home construction and the future is looking bright with materials that increase Energy Efficiency and really create a healthy environment for our homes all right ladies do you have a secret desire to become a Hands-On do it yourself well on today's show we launch a series of tip segments devoted to women and Power tools called girls powered up oo you got my attention see I think the guys are going to like it too absolutely all right the show is jam-packed so let's get it started all right stick around and see it all right now on designing [Music] spaces [Music] maintaining hardwood and laminate floors is something many folks really don't want to think about but with some simple procedures and the Right cleaning materials your floors will look nicer and last a lot longer a major part of saving money is keeping what we have in good condition for a longer time rather than replacement this can extend throughout the house including the floors designing space is hooked up with Peter Penza from laminator plus we specialize in maintaining laminate floors and they're here to show us exactly how can we keep these floors looking good looking like new with that new floor smell and look but still even restore some old dull laminate floors Peter thank you so much for joining us today on designing spices I want you to tell me in your expertise and in your um experience some people call you with their questions and gripes about their l floors what is the most common issue that comes up the real common complaint that we get is the fact that the floors never look as good as the day they went in so the beautiful thing is you can do it yourself you can successfully clean maintain protect and of course extend the life of the laminate floor with a system Peter why don't you go ahead and tell us all the steps are involved in your system okay it's basically a two-step process we have a deep scrub product that cleans the floor first and gets off all the residue or anything that the homeowner might have put down on their floor and then we have a resta ation product goes on top of that that seals it and protects it and then the third product is a maintenance product that they just use on normal maintenance once a week or once every two weeks okay it sounds pretty easy to use but talking about this one thing why don't you go ahead and show us at work okay great let's do it excellent we are ready for some super serious cleaning so uh Peter go ahead and tell me what are the supplies that we need to get started okay the the supplies are a bucket of cold water we have a scrub mop that we use with the Deep scrub we have a microfiber mop that we use with with the restoration okay and what are these three bottles of a year can you tell me more about these well I brought with me today Anthony Thompson who is our founder of the company and I like him to explain that to you hi Peter hiy great to be here so uh tell me you've got red uh yellow and green over there they're obviously different so tell me what's the uh specific need for every single one of them yes this uh this is what you start with is the green one it's deep scrub it's designed to remove uh old waxes old cleaners whatever whatever someone may have used on their floor okay so it undoes the damage of years of neglect if you want to call it that yes um and gives you a clean slate correct yes and how about the yellow one what does that do that actually uh restores the floor it puts a nice protective coating on the floor it brings up the sh uh the the shines of the floor MH uh does a wonderful job on okay so it actually protects your investment by laying that protective layer on there yes okay very good and last but not least what is the red bottle doing red bottles is a everyday cleaner you use it once a week or twice a week you use very little and it does a fabulous job and cleaning floors okay so that's your everyday tool to keep the floor the way that it should be looking okay very good actually all three products are biodegradable two of the products the Deep scrub and the buff dry cleaner revitalizer are both 100% green and the restoration is 90% green W very good so it's very safe for pets and children which a lot of people are concerned with excellent that's very important that's good well it sounds like we have everything we need and uh let's get ready to get our hands dirty and start doing some cleaning okay great so basically what we're going to do here is anony is going to spray the the Deep scrub on the floor and then he's going to spread it and we're going to let it sit for a few minutes so you want it to be actually a little bit moist is that just a little bit okay and then you agitate and once you've reach that process mild scrubbing and you go to your microfiber mod okay okay so we're putting the microfiber on we're using the same device we're just putting a different covering on and now we're going on to the next stage what are we doing now now we're going to apply the actual restoration laminated restoration this is what uh seals and protects the floor this is very easy to apply show me how e what you should do before you start is you should Mist a little onto your mop so it gets just a little damp before you start and it's just a light mist well you guys have done an exceptional job today and I say you guys cuz I was just watching in the background so good fore you guys let me ask you this okay we've pretty much refurbished this floor to bring it back to its former glory but there isn't any of that smell or that you know the chemical smell that you normally have how often do we need to reapply I've seen it last as long as a year plus um depending on the traffic in the house we've pretty much saved this floor from ending up in a landfill somewhere and you mentioned it's not just good for laminate flooring as well no right uh it actually worked extremely well on wood bamboo and cork floors as well there we go so thinking green is the way to go we're doing it right here with laminator plus um is there a website we can go to yes if you go to laminator plus.com gentleman again thank you so much for joining us today here on designing spaces thank you very much we appreciate your time excellent well there you have it maintaining what you
