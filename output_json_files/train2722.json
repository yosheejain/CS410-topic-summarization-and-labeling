        "transcript": "but first we're heading into the channel 4 kitchen for an international dish here's the story behind a very special pasta recipe that's coming up next wait where do they look whether you're visiting another country we're almost at you or watching the travel shows on tv you know how good some of those international meals can be well now you can make some of those same dishes without stepping foot out the door we've got young chef tony tahan he's no stranger to culture his family's from the middle east he was born in venezuela and he was raised in south florida he's infusing all of these cultures into his dishes and he's joining us this morning with an original pasta meal it's named after your best friend yep zarina thank you so much for having me nice to meet you nice to meet you um yeah i came up with this dish because i like a lot of mediterranean flavors it's very healthy it's very the food is very quick to put together and it tastes amazing so my friend she my friend zarina she loves spinach that's her like one thing that she like absolutely loves so i'm like why not make a pesto using spinach and since spinach is a lot cheaper than pesto being a college student when i came up with this dish very good uh it was a very good dish that sounds genius and healthy all right yeah so should we get started all right so all you need is a blender okay so we put in a lot of spinach into the blender and what i like to do is instead of putting all the spinach in at once i put in a little bit and then the milk usually pesto is all olive oil but just to make it a little lighter a little creamier i love the creamy texture that the milk brings so i like to turn it on and it's really loud so we're gonna you get the idea tv magic yeah tv magic so you put in the rest of the spinach okay oh we lost a couple of leaves that's right um so yeah you put in believe me all the spinach fits in there so what you want to do is the rest just stuff it in you want it slowly as long as you get the first bit going everything else okay processes so we add a little parmesan cheese pre-shredded from the grocery store it's great i leave a little time saver right yeah oh my gosh with time these days that you know you just want to anywhere you can cut corners is fantastic so i'm going to leave a little for the garnish on top okay um toasted walnuts oh you wanna absolutely i'm all about like not you could leave also no some of them on top for garnish okay yes and usually traditionally pesto is made with pine nuts but again really expensive sometimes in the grocery store walnuts work perfectly and if you don't want to have parmesan cheese pecorino romano any sort of cheese oh okay yeah and um so this is an optional ingredient okay red pepper flakes i like to add it it's a little cake no no no definitely not a lot and one little trick is um you rub them between your fingertips and the oils okay that have been dormant in the cupboard for so long they just pop right out they wake up this is where you just dump it all in and silence everybody we can see why i don't cook no and this is such an easy version right yeah it's got a nice little heat to it so at this point you put the top on you put the top on and get it whirling okay and you know tv magic absolutely there it is and you get this sauce right here oh wow literally this took us what like a couple of a minute yeah so we have this sauce and another thing that she likes that i like to keep in mind when any making any dish for any of my friends is that she loves mushrooms and mushrooms and pasta go really well so here we have baby baby bellas okay and what are these are like small portobello mushrooms and they're very meaty you take out the stem and you just cut them into little quarters all right we sauteed the mushrooms they turn out like this nice and juicy we have pasta and you've sauteed them for how long uh three minutes okay yeah okay with a lot of olive oil salt pepper and you're set to go i like to add the mushrooms and then add the sauce and you get this nice vibrant green color um it is bright green yep so you toss it together so look at this i love this green color this is and where can i put this here yeah we can set it here okay i don't want to that's just hot i don't want you to look at this color oh wow yeah it's very vibrant pops right from the dish and again we can't forget our garnish is you eat with your eyes first yes well i eat with uh about all of me especially this early in the morning oh and i never had pasta so early you know what it's better than sushi look at this and literally oh i'll give it a try it looks so pretty well if you want to know more about tony get his recipes or just check out his video blogs we've posted a link to his website on our website go to news4jax.com click on the big red find it button and look under the weekend headlines coming up in the next hour we're leaving italy and heading to the

        "transcript": "hey guys it's me vix 23 with some Minecraft castle Siege gameplay this is a really cool mini game I was playing with Noah Gizzy Russia and dolphin and we had a lot of fun playing the game typ I'm going to be explaining it first of all before we jump into some of the game playay so basically you have two teams in their two castles and I've spawned in just here I did end up on the other team to all the guys I was playing with but spawned in just there and you have all these chests that randomly spawn really good items in and your team kind of equips all of your stuff you suit up for battle you get know whatever stuff you want you pick and choose and you craft stuff as well you can you know the whole map is destructible as well so TNT comes in pretty useful as you can see your team arm up basically and then once you've got that done once you've got all of the items that you want to have you go into battle and the items actually do respawn in that chest over time I believe they respawn depending on you know how many kills your team gets so it's kind of like if you guys play Call of ever played Call of Duty and you played War where you got kind of momentum for doing better in the game it's kind of like that so the more kills you get the more items you get spawning in you basically build up momentum you push forward towards the enemy base over this River and towards their base and in this game we were actually playing Team Deathmatch but there's also another game mode called Castle Siege which is where you have to basically destroy the enemy castle by hitting a button and protecting it for 20 seconds but this is just Team Deathmatch right here so as you can see you've got the kill count on the side right there so it's just basically all out trying to get kills which is also really fun in this kind of environment just going in on people and everyone drops all of these items you know you've got to sort through all of the stuff get the best stuff you know make sure you're killing people team up all that kind of stuff it's actually a lot of fun to play and actually after this team death match bit of gameplay ends I'm going to show you guys some of the castle Siege game mode game play which is first of all us going to be defending our Castle from the enemy team they're trying to destroy it trying to hit that button and hold it for 20 seconds

        "transcript": "[Music] hey guys how's it going it is and welcome to another Minecraft Edition 0.1.1 mod Factory this is episode 2 so last time we reviewed the robotic craft yeah robotic craft and today I have you guys Atomic science another mod and so basically it's a little bit of a nerdy mod this time because um yeah I just had so basically the first going to need to do in this mod is it's all about uh breaking down elements and creating new elements and all the elements are here with different atomic numbers there's 10 different elements at the moment the stone smooth Stone which atomic number is one wood this is the Minecraft thetic table you can craft it with simply one book so um yeah this is the stone a topic number is one uh log any logom number is two coal or coal is three iron is four gold is five lapis is six diamond is seven Netherrack is eight glowstone is n and EMD is the highest which is 10 so the atomic periodic table only works on these 10 elements so yeah after you know their element atomic mass number thing magig you're going to need to craft um these you're going to need to craft some insane machines I got to pop the recipe of them right here but they're in this chest here so we have three machines U two machines here we got the atomic clasher which ISB by two pieces of gold oh no sorry four blocks of gold the ree will be on screen uh two Redstone two pieces of redstone and three glass pain that is the atomic clasher basically I'm going to put from outside and the put down the proton extract is CED by two iron blocks two Redstone and I'm pretty sure it is three iron bars so yeah that is basically the two machines that this mod as in and also the atomic pipe spider go away is corupted by um just simply six plus pieces of glass paint it's just to make it look good it doesn't really do anything but basically this is where you're going to set it up so basically uh the atomic what the hell I just broke it I just I just broke my own Atomic extractor I feel sad now I feel really sad now Liam help um sorry so the atomic clasher you put it down here and then the proton retractor is like that so basically you put the atomic look Atomic pipes in the middle and I completely messes up P it look the pipes aren't even going into the machine fail it works anyways so I'm going to go back into the factory for like 2 seconds to grab my materials which are in this chest so basically these are the things we can use to break down smoothstone log coal iron gold uh lapis block by the way Diamond Netherrack glow stone and and EMD so basically I'm going to break these down with the proton extractor which is the iron block looking one um and basically you just tap on it and it say protracted so as you can see the um smooth will give you one proton oak wood or any wood will give you two coal will give you three iron will give you four protons and and gold will give you six protons lapis L block will give you uh SE uh will give you six what hell D will give you seven and then it is goes like this so Netherrack will give you eight uh G will give you n and emerald a single Emerald will give you 10 so basic what you need to do now is after you get some protons you're going to need to craft some another item that is very important in this which is the synthetic nucleus so to trft the synthetic nucleus you're going to need one piece of glass paint and four leather so it's pretty simple to craft and PLP in the crafting table and simply you'll get three synthetic nucleus so I'm actually going to take quite a few more if you don't mind there we go there's all the stic clear in here so I got 23 of them basically you do is is you simply go up to the atomic clasher you tap on them with the protons as many times you want so of course the atomic number is how many times you want so say if you want a smooth Zone it'll say proton count one and you just tap on it with a a synthetic nucleus and it'll create a smooth Zone and then two is log three is coal as you can see It'll drop a coal and then four is iron five as you see you can count it down to five five will be gold six will be lapis block uh seven would be diamond and eight would be Netherrack and then nine if I can get it up to nine would be the one the only glowstone and I'm going to have to break down this once more so I can change anything as you can see you can just kind of switch between all of them and the max proton you can get to is 10 and then it won't take anymore so that is the emerald as you can see that is basically it like this is how model basically you break down materials and you can create them with new materials or you can break down new material Mak the old hero it's kind of like a recycle kind of so it's pretty cool and other than that that's basically it for mod Factory season 2 episode 2 if you guys did enjoy leave a like down below be sure to subscribe and of course if you want to see some more then just show some support and uh suggest the next mod you want to see down in the comments below it has to be technology related as this is this uh mod Factory"

        "transcript": "[Music] the video review will start in a few seconds but if you're watching this on YouTube remember if you have a question comment or suggestion for me you can post it on 3dgame man.com and the link is provided below hello again I'm Rodney Reynolds from 3game man.com and welcome to another video review today I'm looking at the thermal console One gaming headset a fantastic looking box with plenty of information about the product on it as well as a clar window so you can actually see it and at the back there is a picture of the product and some more information there's one security seal at the top let me cut that and let's see what's inside it's packaged very well with the headset and a controller at the top also easy to remove it some of these are secured with cable ties but this one isn't there's a bag with some things inside of it I'll have a look at that in just a minute also here they include warranty information and a users's manual the carry pouch for the headset and really anything else that you want to throw in it is very soft it also has a way of securing what's inside of it very easily they include a couple of cables this is a m to male 2.5 mm cable also they include this one which is is RCA plugs pass throughs to a 3.5 mm female end and just to prove that this headset does fit inside of this carry pouch let me demonstrate it is a fairly tight fit just kind of push it in like so and at the top you can just tuck these cables in and then secure it oh and by the way before I forget their logo is on the other side of this glorious pouch okay let's continue here first of all let me go through the specifications and then I'll have a closer look at it now this headset will work with PCS and consoles so it's the best of all worlds Xbox PlayStation 3 and PC no problem for this particular headset because at the end they've got a couple of plugs a USB end and a 3.5 mm Jack end and a controller which has a switch on it for the PC as well as the gaming consoles I'll show you that closer up in just a minute now the drivers in these are pretty impressive driver unit is 40 mm the impedance is 32 ohms frequency response is from 20 Herz to 20,000 Herz and the sensitivity is 114 DB now this is a noise cancelling by directional microphone the mic sensitivity is minus 54 DB and the mic frequency is from 100 HZ to 10,000 HZ a very beautiful looking headset that's of course if you like this color green but it's very well constructed and the build quality as well as the overall design on this is quite appealing now the air cups here are padded so you should be able to wear this headset for extended periods note the ventilation as well so thus your ears should not overheat the right speaker is labeled as well as the left speaker at the top a nice comfortable head band and as I showed you earlier these fold down now like most headsets these are designed for mediumsized heads and they should be pretty comfortable with the padding on both the ear cups and as well they are not too tight and other words they're not spring loaded too heavily so they should not you know pinch your ears and your head too much as well these ear cups do have a little teeny tiny bit of play in them and that should make it even more comfortable the inline controller looks quite nice it has a clip at the back on the side there's a PC 2 gaming console switch so if you're using the gaming console switch it to game if you're using the PC switch it to PC here's a mute button a status LED and on the other side is a volume control now this is a 2.5 mm mic Jack and you use the included 2.5 mm mail to mail cable to connect it from the Xbox 360 gaming controller into the inline controller and the status LED on the inline controller is green note that their logo which is on either side of the headset does glow red when it's connected into a USB port they include a nice long tanglefree braided cable notice the velcro tie to organize the cable the USB end has a plastic plug on it to protect really other things that this might come in contact with as well as protecting the plug itself of course it's goldplated and this is the 3.5 mm plug now I have listened to the quality of the microphone what I'll do is I'll whisper and then I'll talk normally and then I'll just start yelling so he can get some idea how the microphone does perform so now I am Whispering can you hear me and now I am talking normally and now I am pretty much Yelling to the top of my lungs so as you can hear the sound quality of the microphone is very impressive now to give you some idea what this looks like on somebody's head well have a look it's great as well note that this mic boom swings up and down and you can pretty much bend it into any position that you like this headset's really geared towards somebody who is into gaming big time on their PC and consoles It's the Best of Both Worlds really the overall look appearance design and build quality on this is very good and also the sound quality is excellent along with a fantastic mic now while this is not a 5.1 Channel headset it does offer fantastic sound through the 240 mm drivers you know what for the most part that is more than adequate overall this is a kick-ass product until until next time take care I hope you enjoyed this video review and please note that pricing for this product is available on the 3D game man video review page"
