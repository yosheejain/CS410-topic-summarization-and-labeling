        "transcript": "what is up guys Nick here today and welcome to a new episode of the road to the max escape from scratch Series so I do apologize once again I say as every [\u00a0__\u00a0] episode that uh the uploads will not be as often as usual blah blah blah blah and um this is one of those cases where this episode is going to be rather short of the progress but the amount of hours that I put in and the amount of time that I've put in to present this amount of content will not clearly reflect how much um I actually did so uh to get started I start off by getting 91 uh divination so I want to get back on my divination grind I really wanted to get through with a lot of it I actually had an idea of uh collecting all of my own energy to make Porters and um making those Porters will make it give me the ability to bank things without actually banking them they automatically send [\u00a0__\u00a0] to your bank and I was thinking about Mining and it's 150,000 gold ore from the level that I'm at for the concentrated gold deposits in the living Rock Cavern so what I decided to do was try to get enough Porters to get me to 99 mining so that is going to be a [\u00a0__\u00a0] ton and I was actually able to get over uh as you can keep an eye on the radiant energy down the bottom left corner over 100k radiant energy and I was able to convert those all to Porters so it's about 1. 1.8k Porters which equals about 40,000 uh gold ore deposit for me so it's pretty awesome and it does take me a lot longer to get these divination levels considering that I am just using the uh experience method I'm not actually using enhanced experience where I put energies and convert that into extra experiences I would be able to and also I've been grinding out my her lure I've been using the enlightenment Aura uh whenever I get I've been using it right on herb just because I don't have the like I don't feel like spending all my time trying to boss to get money for um getting these skills up that'll take twice as long and twice the money to get up when I need to be doing other stuff for the road to Max as well so and I also do apologize that some of these clips have the weird uh overlay some of them were on my laptop while I was doing schoolwork I had a project I needed to do and it took up way too much space for me to uh actually do both at the same time so I do apologize for that so I was able to get 95 div which able gave me the ability to go to a 95 spot and um so the XP definitely picked up and um it's very AFK because the spots are so close to each other and actually got 89 and 90 herblore today so there's another level at 90 and Herb to me is a big AC accomplishment to get up that high all I need now is to get prayer up that High and um bossing will be a breeze so actually talking about bossing I was able to get or so here's um another divination level bam 98 eight divination so this is where I really wanted to get 99 for this video but it would take a whole another week before I'd be able to get this video out and I really really wanted to get it out I've been really excited I've been grinding a lot lately and it takes so long to get those divination levels especially 97 and 98 uh getting 99 is going to be a while as well it'll probably be through this whole next week if I do divination every day the entire day so um it's kind of going to be up to you guys if you would like me to grind out 99 divination this week get that as first CP for next video I can otherwise I'll probably just take a day or like day by day do a couple hundred XP a day and um work on other stuff as well so I actually got really lucky bossing if you guys saw the clip that I uploaded from my live stream I actually streamed for a few hours of bossing ended up getting four drops from four different bosses so ended up getting a dragon Hatchet along with two Warrior rings from dks I was able to get a armor chain skirt solo then got a murmur necklace from s demon and then a Bandos chest plate from Bandos today so within the last 24 hours I've been really lucky and it gave me the ability to um fund a lot of stuff so I've been really excited to be able to actually buy [\u00a0__\u00a0] again and there's so much I really need to do on this account and I've been so motivated lately um I've been playing a lot of Call of Duty which gave me a lot of time to actually work on divination so those two go hand in hand but now I'm really excited to start working on Slayer I really want to get Slayer done by the Fall so I hope to get 92 to 99 by at least October um at the very latest so I'm also planning on saving up to buy a gaming PC for my house I do like whenever I'm on the gaming PC live streaming it's at Kevin's house uh but I'm really looking forward to saving money and buying one myself for my house when the fall winter and spring around I'll be able to live stream consistently and doing whatever I'm doing on the road to Max series and hopefully be able a lot of you guys to be able to tune in for that and be a lot more interactive I mean I talk with everybody already while I'm in the chat um if you guys ever join the French chat I'm always in there always able to talk to everybody and so I've actually I did some quests believe it or not I actually did the um fate of the Gods so if anybody knows me actually you've watched all these you know I hate questing absolutely hate it and um so I ended up doing fate of the Gods which was a huge step for me um doing like an actual Quest that isn't that easy it's not very general so U I was really excited to get that done so now I can use the nightmare musba so which helps out on divination a crap ton so um that makes it a lot easier so that's the bank so far um for right now so I want to wish all or really thank everybody first of all for anybody body who still donating astal runes especially this guy gave me a 50,000 donation of astal runes thank you very much Ryan you are the man you're a funny dude and in the French chat quite often and um so thank you everybody who does Astro Rune donations still and also congratulations to everybody who's gotten 99s that I've recorded in the following Clips um but I do still need to talk about a lot it's been a long time since I've uploaded so I do need as much time as I can to talk about everything um so uh I I really want to do some more bossing serieses serieses is series along with the road to Max episodes so and along with the Slayer episodes as well it's a big part of how I make all of my money I boss a lot so if you guys have any suggestions please I know a lot of you guys don't comment on these videos at all you never do um if you could comment any suggestions I'd really appreciate it because I'm not sure if I want to do a road to all drops from God Wars dungeon it would take a very long time excuse me I really had to burn um I could do something like that I could do me and Max M were thinking about doing a road to 10 Dragon hatchets from dks and then showing all the loot we got with those 10K hatchets along with all that um I could do a like the total rework 1K loot from all the different God Wars dungeon bosses and um I could even do qbd I could do a loot from 4 or like 500 solo obviously it's a solo boss like way over time time these wouldn't be anything rushed I would really like to have a defined series something that I could do while I'm doing all this that would also make me money on the side so please let me know if you guys have any ideas of what to do U I would really appreciate it I appreciate all of the uh feedback you guys give as well so um I hope you guys did enjoy this video I do have a lot more to talk about I really wish I had more Clips to kind of do stuff with but I really hope you guys enjoy this video I won't be around it all this weekend so I do apologize that I won't be getting anything done but I hope you guys enjoyed if you did please leave a like favor subscribe if you are new and until next time guys thank you very much for watching and peace out I'll try to upload a video just talking about random stuff to hopefully Sunday as well so

        "transcript": "hi I'm Sam Howie and today we're going to make mushrooms with a garlicky herb both of the ingredients first obviously you need mushrooms and we're going to have some seasoning on those and some olive oil we'll need a glass of wine the juice of one lemon 1 clove of garlic very finely chopped we need some more olive oil about 3 tablespoons 2 or 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a pan we also need some parsley some flat-leaf parsley which we're going to chop as well we also need a griddle pan it's not essential you can grill them but a griddle pan I think gives you the nice lines on there and it'll be quicker as well that's what you need and now I'm going to show you what you need to do right mushrooms I'm using our the large flat mushrooms you can use it any sort of mushrooms really but I think these look nicer and they're easier to work with there's not so much to pull apart and fiddle with so what we need to do is take out these stalks to start with now they should just break out quite easily what we're going to do is chop those up finely and they will not be wasted they'll be going in the sauce we need to put some olive oil on these so that they'll cook in the griddle pan curious about the top seasoning they're ready to be kissed now what we're going to do is cook the mushrooms at the same time as cooking the sauce so we'll prepare everything ready for the sauce we're going to finely chop these mushrooms stalk we've already got a couple of tablespoons of two to three tablespoons of olive oil in the pan and I've got the juice of one lemon add a fairly decent-sized glass of white wine we've got one garlic clove chopped and we've also got some flat leaf parsley as well which I'm just going to chop down a little bit we've got a handful of of the parsley here maybe a couple of tablespoons for its crush still probably fine enough put that in as well what I've done is saved a couple of little sprigs here that I'm just actually going to pop on the top as a decoration when I finished that needs to go on a high heat we want that to boil and then it should reduce down I'm going to add the mushrooms that we chopped earlier to the sauce as well it's starting to ball now so we'll add the mushrooms to the hot pan few minutes on each side you know I'm sure it's going to be lovely all together this great is a starter I'm going to do is turn these over I'm actually serving to her person but you could do one there's more sauce left over so you can either add that for the mushrooms if you want more sauce or you could use some lovely bits of crusty white bread and mop it up with that or you could pop it in the fridge and use it with pasta perhaps the next day anyway enjoy and thanks for watching"

        "transcript": "one ordinary pen placed in one ordinary glass of water place it down straight and it's magnified then we tilt the pen and suddenly it looks bent what is happening here first let's start with an analogy say we have a car on a racetrack surrounded by a rough duct when the : a racetrack it carries on their own forwards at the same speed but when one wheel hits the dirt the friction causes that wheel to go slower than the wheel on the other side so this will acts as a pivot and the car spins around now let's use that analogy to explain how light travels through a block of glass initially we start during rains then we realize that we had to think about light as a wave in this situation so that mean water fly a diagram light travels slower through glass block so the same thing happens as we've happened to the car as soon as one part of the wave touches the slower denser glass it bends and starts moving slower and then it reaches the outside and lopsy happens it moves faster and bends back again you can use this analogy to remember that weird light travels into a denser material it travels to Worzel normal and when it travels into a less dense material it travels away from the normal now we can go back to the original demonstration and explain that using refraction you'll notice however that it is pretty much the same type of ray diagram and the same concepts as we explored last week with convex lenses you can see here we end up with the magnified image as we saw when the pen is tilted and off to the side however and we try to draw a ray diagram straight from the pen to our eyes we noticed refraction causes the light rays to bend straight off away from our eyes to solve this we need to draw a new serve ray diagrams bending through the air and the glass to meet our eyes however this ends up with an image that is both magna and to the side of the actual object and is this which produces the weird optical illusion that we saw"

        "transcript": "hey what's going on everybody my name is Rocky cinal or you can call me Rockies and today we are going to be doing my first top five on Call of Duty zombies what we're going to be talking about today is the top five Noob mistakes in Call of Duty zombies the top five mistakes that every Noob makes at least one time in their career so let's just jump right into it at the number Five Spot we have training now training is when you run in a circle get all the zombies to spawn in on you and then when they're all spawned in you turn around and shoot them but what noobs do is they'll run half a train and they'll start running backwards and they'll either run into a corner or run into another zombie and die instantly because they get sandwiched by zombies and that is by far one of the number one Noob mistakes in Call of Duty zombies it happens all the time and you know other than that they'll have a train behind them and they'll run into your train you guys will Clash trains and die together that is very very frustrating definitely one of the top five Noob mistakes in Call Duty zombies now going on to number four we have noobs Pack-a-Punch and now Pack-a-Punch is of course $5,000 on every single map except for five when you get that special perk and it's like one grand but that is besides the point when you're Pack-a-Punch of course you want to be as low on ammo if not empty on ammo if you can be so what noobs decide to do is they get a ray gun they get a hammer or they get an RPD you know whatever they get they decide to Pack-A-Punch it right off the bat it'll be like round 20 and they'll need a new gun and they're like you know what I might as well Pack-a-Punch this it's round 20 it's high enough round that I should Pack-a-Punch no use all the ammo you possibly can stack up your points as much as you possibly can because you do not know when you're going to get another max ammo so waste all your ammo and when you're finally empty on ammo in both guns that is the time for you to Pack-A-Punch your weapon that is by far one of the things that frustrates me the most about noobs is when they Pack-a-Punch any and every gun right off the bat right after they get it out of the box so going on to number three we have getting perks when you can not so say you went down you don't have any perks you don't have Juggernaut you don't have Quick Revive you don't have speed cola you know you don't have anything but say we're mid round on round 25 there's zombies everywhere you have a train behind you and you decide that you need Juggernaut so you go to the corner where Juggernaut is you start to drink it you pay $2,500 for your Juggernaut and you're starting to drink it and you get two hit because you're still drinking it that is what I call getting a perk when you cannot get a perk when you have a train or when it's mid round and you think you need the perks so much that you go to get it and you die while you're drinking it that is something that happens to noobs all the time they think as long as they click that button they automatically have that perk you have to wait for yourself to drink the perk before you have it equipped onto your person and that is by far one of the things that I see happened the most that has happened to me so many times I cannot even fathom how many times it has happened now going on to number two we have knifing on early rounds now knifing is a one hit kill on one on round one it's a two hit kill on round two three hit on round three etc etc etc and by far one of the biggest mistakes I see people doing is wasting all of their pistol ammo on rounds 1 two and three why not just wait for them to come through the windows why not knife them why not rebuild the barriers I do not know they waste all their ammo shooting them while they're on the other side of the barrier I just do not understand what is wrong with people shoot them one two three times and then knife them if you have to you can get the most points you possibly can now moving on to the number one spot guys we have Reviving people when you cannot revive them this kind of goes with getting perks when you can't and you know Pack-a-Punch him when you can't obviously but Reviving another player when you cannot do so say you have a train behind you you're running around the map you have a train everybody's down except for you and one other person and you're like I really need you to be out I can do this without you I go and get Quick Revive to revive you but when I'm Reviving you I go down to because you are either in the worst possible spot or I had the genius idea that I should try to revive you even though I have every zombie in the map on my ass on round 40 that is one of the biggest mistakes if not the biggest mistake that noobs make in Call of Duty zombies they try to revive anyone and everyone that goes down just because they think that they need them and that is not the case at all if you cannot revive someone simply do not revive them they can come back they can get their guns and perks again of course if you know they're really really good they have like the thunder gun or something you might want to revive them because they actually might be able to save your ass but if you cannot revive them don't even try to revive them that is the biggest mistake I see in Call of Duty zombies so hopefully you guys enjoyed my first top five it did not go exactly how we wanted it to but I think it went pretty good one honorable mention that I have for you guys is Tombstone of course we have this on transit town Farm you know I don't know what Maps we have it on but it is in Black Ops 2 and one of the things that I see from noobs the most is when people buy Tombstone they're like I don't want to lose my guns I Don't Want to Lose My Perks you're not going to revive me so they get down and they automatically go to Tombstone when I definitely could have revived them and I definitely needed them so that is today's honorable mention four top five new plays hopefully you guys enjoy let's try to drop 25 likes on this video that would be much appreciated I'm Rocky CA and I'm out for the day peace"

        "transcript": "hey what's up everybody mr. chunk rock here with football game any castle crafters bringing you a redstone tutorial video very simple redstone contraption that I'm building here that I'm going to be bringing you it's amazing and it's awesome and it's perfect for the tu14 update that's coming up supposed to be a big one it's supposed to be awesome so I figure I bring you a little something now I'm bringing you this video today from our or my test world I should say a little bit of redstone stuff going on I know a little bit about redstone I know you're probably freaking out wondering now mr. Chung call you do was build well I do build most of the time I like messing around and testing stuff so that's why I'm bringing you this today now this design itself that I'm going to bring you is not my design if a buddy of mine by the name Mexican 10 brought this design to me as we were messing around on here a long time ago and brought it to my attention and it's pretty awesome now the reason I'm bringing to you guys now because again tu14 is coming up we're going to be getting hoppers and you'll see why this design will be good for that now you can also build this design and survival you won't lose use up a lot of resources by building it and survival so it's awesome in that aspect as well I do have a bigger scale of it over there I haven't tested it yet so that's why I'm not going to be bringing you the big skill today so small scale is going to be done today all right it's very simple so let's just get right into it this is what you're going to need basically you can use any building block or any block or your choice but we'll get started so you're going to place to dirt blocks like that okay I'll going to use it thus I in their place the repeater on top of it like that just regular no ticks or nothing like that okay bring that up just like that I want to make sure I got bring that out yeah because that's what the torch goes torture go there redstone dust goes on top repeater here now this one is I all the way back on for tix okay then we're going to come here and place that that those two blocks there go ahead and remove that one because you don't need that one we'll go ahead and place a regular pissed in there now this is a regular piston facing this way facing towards you will place that there then we'll place this block here that there that there don't worry you're going to remove this one and remove this one then here we will replace it we're going to place a sticky piston I'll show you why here in a second okay now now replace a block here again any block of your choice will work then you break the one we use to build the mechanism and then we're going to add a glowstone there and you wonder you say why glowstone why can't put anything else there it's simple because you need glowstone but you need a light source to help melons grow I don't know how in my experiences I've had to have light sources around to help them glow so or happen grow so that's how that works out like that again that's the that's the design it's simple it's compact literally I can't even tell you how many blocks three blocks six blocks nine blocks total we can remove that one if you want you don't necessarily necessarily need that again very simple guys look at that it's very simple now let's get into the other stuff that we need so we'll get rid of that come in here let's grab some bone meal let's grab melon seeds pumpkin seeds for argument's sake because it may take a while to grow we'll grab a melon and we'll grab a pumpkin and of course we need we need them home because we don't let him hold again if you love them all that's you that's the old situation some people don't love hoes some people do some people love them too much some people don't I know it's up to you yet anyway before we get there before this video ends up on the other side of YouTube let's get going so till that ground so you have farmland there okay then you're going to get going it's going to plant the watermelon we'll do that one first okay we'll make it grow up real nice and smacks you like and bumper on but I'm but uh now again for argument's sake we'll pretend that

        "transcript": "today's gaming graphics and their virtual worlds are thrilling complex and visually stunning at the movies and sports that inspire them so no matter what unfulfilled adventures your imagination can come up with chances are there's a game to match you want to smack the beads of sweat off joe frazier's face become the country's best covert spy build an illegal empire in miami how about going back to school where the mo is stealing lunch money and administering some serious weddings check it out tell me about it yeah man this is my gaming room i got posters all over the world and i got my energy drinks collection up here that i used for late night gaming yeah i have the energy drinks yeah and i got some i got my systems over here i got everything dating back to super nintendo don't have the regular nintendo dude where's the red moon well basically the graphics are so great you can just look at spiders and basically you know how good your fighter's doing he's hurt he'll be like grimacing or something like he's out of breath he'll be breathing hard so what about the gameplay itself control the boxers effectively definitely it's actually really intuitive there's a system called total punch control you want to throw a dab you just flip the control strip up into the left and throw them down you want to throw like a left hook you hook it up to the left and then mark it around for a hook each boxer controls exactly like his uh real life counterpart so that means like if you're using roy jones juniors and juice punches very cool what's up next we got herself all right well basically it's a stealth game it's probably the best stealth game but this one specifically uh it's called bubble agent and they've added some things to give it a little more a little more flair basically after the first mission your character and fishery goes up in detail so what about the gameplay you have to be very patient to play this game i mean usually i'm not like that kind of gamer but if there was any game that was going to convert me to the stealth genre i think it was wonderful because you just have to do so many cool things the first mission you dive underneath the lake and you there's guards walking on the top of the ice and you're underneath the ice and you chip away at the ice create a little hole and then once they get close to the before you create it you grab up and you take them down and snip their necks all right jones we got starface nick i'm expecting to see a lot of violence how does the game stack up the movie in that final scene of the movie in his mansion when the assassins come to kill him it kind of takes the premise of what if tony montana would have survived it's about speaking on the territory it's about getting new storefronts regaining your empire they have an exotic catalog where you can buy like 10 style rides you can get both a tiger you can buy that was very similar yeah you know people will draw a lot of comparisons i think the targeting system is a little bit better than the graphic you can target like different parts of their body their face their left kidney they're right not i'm not even joking about this kind of stuff yeah and basically if you do that it'll build up your ballsy when you do that you can send them into this al pacino like where you're pretty much invincible you consider rooms with like 20 guys oh you know i've heard a lot of people say if you're going to get an xbox 360 or ps3 elder scrolls for oblivion is the game you have to get what is and the world is more interactive than it's been in this world you can go to any town and talk to any person and they each have their own the world sounds totally cool but what exactly is the game about what's the objective basically what the game is about is there the emperor was a staff name and you kind of have to stop the invading forces of this oblivion around which it's kind of like hell they come into the world you kind of have to stop them you don't have to go into questions you can go around your side quest you want to be good you go and you say the lord people surrounding this game yeah a lot of politicians and people who are really trying to uh stop them from coming out people were saying what is this like a columbine simulator like is it gonna have guns and blood it doesn't have any guns it doesn't have any blood you're actually helping people right you are actually yeah people from the bullies after school so like say you do a mission for the nerds you gotta get him to his locker food and pick up his like dungeons and dragons there's all these little questions in order of strength to the point where they're about to go down you can perform a humiliation finishing and you know if you've ever gotten picked on them which i did you get to act out those aggressions on the poles there you have it everything you need to know to score big with the latest and greatest games john thanks so much for showing us around i'm emory wells for geared up and i'm getting my game off thanks everyone stick around because we'll be dropping in"

        "transcript": "[Music] and so did the rest of the World Part Two was an instant hit selling 7 million copies worldwide by this point Lara was an A-list celebrity and idos knew that in order to meet demands they would need to deliver even more hits it sounded good in theory we had no choice but to release another Tomb Raider year on year each Christmas it controlled our lives for probably five or six years I mean it pretty much ruined most people's lives closest I've ever seen anybody to a mental breakdown fans just wanted more Lara that's what they got in 1998's Tomb Raider 3 core design squeezed the PlayStation for all it was worth in this one top-notch graphics and Innovative nonlinear play accompanied Lara's trip out of the tombs and into London and the states by 1999 idos knew it was time to evolve the franchise yet again Tomb Raider 4 the last Revelation promised improved visuals and even graced a brand new console the Sega Dreamcast we get feedback from Tomb Raider 3 from a lot of people who felt we had gone too model so then Tomb Raider 4 we very much went back to the tomb it was all set in Egypt personally that's probably my favorite game certainly it just felt like this is a complete Game rather than a series of episodes developers had a nasty surprise for longtime fans the game's Cliffhanger ending showed Lara being buried alive in a tomb of her very own people's feelings about Lara actually quite mixed at Cor in a way because she was in a sense almost their Taskmaster you know she was the one forcing him to get these games out year after year in a strange way actually went as far as trying to kill her off in Tom ra of four just to try and avoid having to do two ra of five I think the reason we uh we attempted to kill L off was because we really thought we'd EX exhausted and what we could do with the franchise seeing Lara falling down a gigantic hole in the middle of the pyramid was quite a joyous moment so we all you know went for a few paints and celebrated the death of Lara but um she came back and got as you see Lara promptly returned in 2000's Tomb Raider Chronicles sort of the game unfolded entirely in a series of flashbacks narrated by Lara's friends who believed she was dead she will live on forever in our hearts this was really concern we kind of killed her off so Tom Ro of 5 we did the best job we could but whether our hearts were in it or not I'm not entirely certain by then Lara was running out of breath the franchise pushed the PlayStation 1 to its technical limits reviews and sales started to fall developers listened to Fan feedback and began working on a brand new chapter in the story of Loft titled Tomb Raider the Angel of Darkness little did they know what trouble was waiting around the corner [Music] Gamers were still buying Lara croft's Adventures by the Jeep clods in 2001 but critics and fans agreed the series was losing its luster with the release of the PlayStation 2 the Tomb Raider team decided to overhaul the game for Next Generation consoles quickly the consensus was it needs to change she needs to be able to talk to people needs to be harder Edge to and this whole list of stuff which we all sat around and yeah you know we all bought into as that project went on it was obvious we' made it too big and what we were trying to do was insane I mean just mad the time limit wasn't really enough the team SI wasn't enough Miss loads of deadlines Angel just forced out before before it was really ready in late 2003 the ambitious Tomb Raider the Angel of Darkness was released worldwide with some mixed results result initial sales were strong thanks to an aggressive ad campaign but critically the game received lower scores for its glitchy Graphics an awkward control scheme I don't think you you'd ever get anybody else to admit to Angel of Darkness that it was their fault ultimately it was my fault and I paid for that with my job which I'm very happy about that but was done by committee so you live or die by the sword at the same time players were migrating to newer action adventure games after the angel of dark Darkness idos made a tough decision stop we're going to have to take this way we' got to this um jeweling the crown franchise we've got to be seen to be making a new start so they took it over and gave it to the crystal Dynamics in the states in order to creatively jumpstart the series developers at Crystal Dynamics knew they would have to make some big changes for idos while staying true to the series roots coming back and starting to work on T Legend posed a number of challenges cuz one of the biggest questions that were asked was is a franchise still alive today is a consumer interested an old friend jumped in to help answer those questions Toby guard why iser from the experience of a decade earlier God wanted to rekindle an old flame I wanted to get back involved because I felt like I could help to sort of guide the brand and guide Lara back in a sort of Direction I thought that the original Tomb Raider was taking it with to help developers started the difficult task of Reinventing the series The overhaul began with the leading lady herself for the newest game the box and booty Hunter received a full body change I uh decided to S turn it on its head how we were looking approaching the the character design which was to um keep very very caricatured proportions and shap but then go for real realism in terms of muscle and bone structure and detail next up Crystal Dynamics made Lara's actions much more fluid allowing killer combinations of moves like a pro gymnast Lara could run jump and flip through Legend's intricate tombs the new environments were a huge draw for longtime fans in April of 2006 idos released Tomb Raider legend in the opening scene 9-year-old larara was traveling with her mother when the plane crash landed in the Himalayas the Crofts stumbled on an ancient artifact and Lara's mother accidentally got sucked into a bizarre time Rift the concept is this uh plane crash that she suffered at a young age in the Himalayas and having to escape on her own breaking her out of this sort of cozy lifestyle critics loved the revamped control scheme and called it a true return to the series Roots the changes paid off Legends sold over 3 million copies worldwide becoming the fastest selling Tomb Raider game ever thanks to the daring facelift the Tomb Raider series was back on track and fans couldn't be happier we've just really scratched the surface of what you can do with Tomb Raider up until now and so the future going it's just going to hold so much [Music] more [Music] [Applause] if you"

        "transcript": "down with the oppression we're tired of your region locking Nintendo I'm Awesome Face product for Nintendo news Friday June 28 2013. with the original reversal of Microsoft's DRM policies Gamers voice their being heard all over the Internet and they aren't just focusing on Sony and Microsoft it seems a few groups have set their sights on Nintendo in an effort to end region locking on both the 3DS and the Wii U in case you don't know what exact your region locking is well it's a really stupid policy that limits your console to only playing games from your region of the world so for instance if I want to import an exclusive RPG from over in the UK I wouldn't be able to play it on my North American bought Wii U or 3DS region locking in my opinion is only there to limit the options of the consumers and I've always thought Nintendo of all people would just drop this policy but anyways I'd love to hear your thoughts on the matter so post them in the comments below remember way back in the early days of Nintendo news when we reported on a rumor that awada might resign from his position at Nintendo if the company didn't meet their fiscal goal for the year well apparently a water was misquoted in a recent statement awada says that he doesn't remember ever saying anything like that and instead insists that what he meant was should the company not meet their goal they will simply not focus on that failure and instead Focus their efforts in achieving their next goal so there you have it tawada isn't leaving I don't know about you guys but this is good news to me I can't see Nintendo without a water he's always been there at least as far as I can remember and he's one of the faces of the company so seeing him go would just be terrible I'm glad that he's gonna be around for a little while longer speaking of a lot in a recent interview he explained a few Nintendo's plans for free to play titles on the 3DS and the Wii U he wanted states that you will probably not see mainstream Mario or Pokemon game as a free-to-play title however the first Nintendo free to play title could be released before March 31st 2014. that's kind of a long ways away actually how are Nintendo plans to monetize these free-to-play titles is unknown if I had to guess though they will probably go the micro transaction route in which they will offer in-game purchases to perhaps give you extra items or an advantage in game Who honestly knows but this is Nintendo we are talking about so we can assume that they will have a pretty fair and balance system as they usually do I'll be looking forward to seeing what Nintendo does with this new platform in the near future Nintendo held a Pikmin 3 Center nateo direct this week from this Nintendo Direct we got new footage of the game including what I'm guessing is The Game's opening few moments although this particular Nintendo Direct was only broadcasted in Japanese so it's kind of hard to tell we also learned that Pikmin can be played from the ground a lot easier with just the Press on one button a rock Pikmin were also shown blasting off to high altitudes and rescuing other Pikmin from danger the new flying Pikmin were seen reaching places and getting items that neural Pikmin could not get and one of the coolest things shown off was the replay feature which lets you watch back what you did in that mission now this game will require around 4 gigabytes of space if you download off the eShop so make sure you have that room ready for those who are the digital downloaders of the group anyways that's gonna do for this Nintendo news so once again anyway that's gonna do it for this week's Nintendo news but if you want to listen to talk some more you can come and check out my channel there you'll find that ongoing let's play of Paper Mario for the Nintendo 64 and ducky concrete returns 3D anyways I've been off spacecraft for Nintendo news have a great day"

Better take a quick nap. Right here is good. What\u2019s that Jin? Oh... this is my\nvery latest invention. It is a rear-view mirror\nthat lets you see everything! - Sounds interesting.\n- It is, Amber. With regular mirrors you can\u2019t\nsee everything behind you, but with this you\u2019ll\neven be able to see the top and bottom\nof the car. But Jin is that\nreally necessary? Of course! With this mirror, there are absolutely\nno blind spots. - Jin!\n- Are you OK? Jin, maybe you\nshould concentrate on - what\u2019s ahead of you.\n- Yeah. By the way,\nwhere\u2019d Poli go? Oh, Poli\u2019s doing\na safety check at the construction\nin the park. Say... I think Poli would look\nmuch better with this than me. Yeah. - One two three!\n- We win! OK. One, two, three, four... - Let\u2019s go hide!\n- Wait for me. - five, six...\n- This spot\u2019s perfect. No... this is my spot SUJI! - It\u2019s my spot too!\n- No way! Fine...be that way! seventeen, eighteen,\nnineteen, twenty! Here I come! Found ya! I let ya find me. Got ya! Guess not. She must be around\nhere somewhere. Let\u2019s check over\nat the playground. OK. I\u2019m good at this game. Hey, boys. Sorry but the\nplayground\u2019s under construction Uh Mr. Builder... have you\nseen my sister, SUJI? SUJI? No I haven\u2019t\nseen her for weeks. Where can she be? SUJI! SUJI! SUJI! SUJI! - What\u2019s going on?\n- SUJI! - What happened, Doug?\n- Hi Poli. We were playing hide and seek,\nbut we can\u2019t find SUJI. Has she been gone long? I know I saw SUJI\nwalking this way. Is that...? SUJI! - What are you doing?\n- Oh, you found me. Get out of there! That\u2019s\nnot a safe place to hide! I\u2026 wonder how long I slept! I better get going! - SUJI!\n- SUJI! They\u2019re in danger! All clear in back. Titan stop! Look behind you! Hey.\nWhat did you do that for? Sorry, Titan... but look. - Are you two OK?\n- Yes. So you\u2019re both alright? Yep...but I wouldn\u2019t be\nif you hadn\u2019t saved us! Or if I hadn\u2019t found you. I\u2019m so sorry. I should have\nbeen much more careful. I think we\u2019re all very lucky\nthat nothing terrible happened. But kids, there are some things\nthat you have to remember. OK! Never play around cars or\ntrucks or underneath them. - Right!\n- Why? - Because they have blind spots.\n- What\u2019re they? Well there are certain\nspots around cars, trucks and buses\nthat drivers can\u2019t see, called blind spots. The bigger the vehicle is,\nthe bigger the blind spots are. If children like you walk or\nplay in these blind spots, the drivers can\u2019t see you. What would happen\nif a truck moved with you in its blind spot? Blam! A bad accident!\nJust terrible! - That\u2019s scary.\n- Yes. That\u2019s why you should never\nplay or run around any vehicle. Right! Poli, what should I do if our\nball goes under a car or truck? - Yeah!\n- If that happens, You have to ask the driver\nor an adult to help you. If you try to get it out\nyourself and the truck moves,\nan accident could happen. - Got it?\n- Yes, Poli! We\u2019ll do just what you say! Poli... just try it on! Thanks but, no thanks.\nNot for me. But Poli I made it\njust for you! Poli!!"

        "transcript": "what's up guys it's Ono Tech here and today I'm going to give you guys my reasons why building a PC is better than buying a PC so I hope you guys enjoyed the video and sit back and relax the first real benefit for building a computer over buying a computer is that you get a lot better price performance ratio when you compare a pre-built computer to one that's custom for the same price your price performance ratio is going to differ a lot the custom one will probably be better in performance 99 of the time and well why is that well if you look at this logically you have to think about companies such as I buy Power and Alienware and those typically need to make a profit so money is automatically added to the previous computer on hand by default I also once you calculate stuff like shipping and warranties and using uh products commercially such as Intel and AMD they need to get a profit share as well then the prices can potentially double relative to the custom-built computer so in effect you're really not getting what you paid for when you buy a pre-built computer now they are some places where a preview computer would be better and that's really the sub 350 dollar uh price point under this price point you usually won't be buying a gaming PC or building a gaming PC you would probably use the computer for web surfing and or word processing or just for flash games and honestly buying a computer under that price point would probably benefit you more than building one because building is usually for people who have budgets that are around 400 450 or over and if all you're doing is using it for school then you can buy a used computer for good performance and for a cheap price the next real reason why you should build a PC instead of buy one is the fact that you get to know your components a little bit more and I really want you guys to think about this one for a minute when you build a PC you really know every single part that you put in that case and the case itself but it's not always the case for buying the PC with the PC if you build it yourself you can change the parts to your liking maybe you want an a core CPU and a fast graphics card for high-end gaming or maybe because you're on a budget you're just gonna go for a fast SSD and a medium-sized GPU but when you look at realtor retail computers you can't really do that what you see is what you get and most of the time you have a lot of limits so now there are some sites that actually let you change the components but that's still limited you can only change components that are compatible and it costs more so price is also a factor with this point thirdly upgrades are a lot less tedious on a custom built PC than a retail would and I'll let you guys in on a little secret most of the time not all the time but most of the time retail stores sort of try to trick the buyer into buying their perceived by portraying a really strong uh CPU some really strong RAM and a really good hard drive and I think that's pretty crazy because that's only some of the parts of the PC that are extremely important most of the time they have really bad motherboards and pretty bad power supplies and when the motherboard is the brain of the computer and the power supply powers that brain I think it's pretty fair to believe that those are important parts of the system because of this upgrades are a lot more tedious and you usually have to upgrade other parts just have the initial upgrade upgradable if that makes any sense but with custom built PCS that's usually not the case most of the time you buy reliable brands and you buy Reliable Parts that are mostly compatible and that will last you a long time so upgrades are usually not that bad and they can be fun because they potentially help the computer the last reason why you should build and not buy is because you get a sense of glory and pride once it's built and call me crazy but I hope I'm not the only one that actually fails this most people think that building a PC is hard but it really isn't in a simple way of putting it it's basically putting puzzle pieces together but regardless it can seem a bit challenging and hard and intimidating for the first time user but all in all after you build it you get this awesome sense of Awesomeness and Pride and Glory and you just want to like scream to the whole world that you built a computer and honestly you build a bond with the computer that you built now I'm not saying that buying a PC will make you angry or sad or anything like that but you don't get that awesome feeling after you actually build something for your own it's sort of like the PC is your prize after painstakingly putting it together for two hours for your very first time and it's an awesome prize in fact other than that building in PC is an awesome learning experience that you can really apply to your life so guys I hope you really found this video helpful and if you did leave your thoughts in the comments below like share subscribe all that good stuff and Jazz um I had a lot of questions over this subject and I thought instead of answering them separately in the comments I should just make a video about it so my answer would be I would build and so buy but buy this also an option if you're on a really tight budget or you're a student that just needs a computer for work or flash games online as always guys peace and have a good one"

        "transcript": "hello magic fans and welcome to the final match of the first ever 1996 professional tournament for Magic Gathering I'm Sean Kars along ringside with me is Henry Stern he's going to be our color commentator for the festivities he plays second at the US national championships and was a semi-finalist for the World Championships all last year Henry it's been one heck of a weekend so far hasn't it yeah Sean it has there's never been this many quality magic players gathered together for one tournament before ever I thought last year's World Championships were big this is even bigger I definitely have to agree with you there well let me ask you a question though as a professional player Henry what type of preparation is necessary for an event like this well first of all you have to come up with a quality deck design as you know this tournament you were required to use five cards from all the available expansions in type two you have to think about which cards you want to use and also which cards your opponents might be using thinking about how that might affect your deck design as well once you come up with the quality design you need to practice it against many of the touchdown decks practice against white Weenies and a red blast deck and maybe a control deck once it performs well then you want to take it to a lot of your local tournaments and practice against as many quality opponents as you can all right now Henry we're coming up on the final match first off we've got betran lay from France he's the 1994 French national champion he played second at the world championships in 1994 as well yeah he lost to uh Zack Dolan in those finals in a very close match Bron's a very very strong player all right now he's going going toe-to-toe against Michael lantto from Boston Massachusetts a virtual unknown quantity on the magic scene yeah although Michael's pretty well known in the Northeast area he hasn't played in a very large major tournament before this is pretty much his first big tournament now what can we expect from these two players to better understand what we can expect to have happen in this final match let's take a closer look at both competitors decks Michael lanto is playing a 62c card blue white milstone deck this deck was designed to defeat an opponent not through damage but by running them out of cards he likeed to control the environment and had a heavy creature suppression element now you mentioned creature suppression what exactly is that creature suppression refers to cards that are used to wipe out creatures and Mike lanto has a lot of them he's using four wrath the Gods Four sort of plow shares a balance two control Magics all of these spells can be used to wipe out his opponent's creatures and it's more interesting is he uses two IC manipulators and two spirits and the mous factories all of those can be used to help stall out the Str creatures should he get them out suppose Lono has out one ice manipulator the Str has one creature it can't attack does the Str have to have out two creatures in order to attack that makes the contos rap the gods all the more effective but what's interesting is the contos deck has a very light permission element for this style of deck now when you say permission what exactly does that mean permission spells are any spell that that you can use to counter your opponent spells obv these examples are counter spells and power sinks and spell blasts and lanto is interestingly enough only using four counter spells and one deflection usually in this type of deck you expect to see quite a bit more counter spells so what are the weaknesses of this type of deck well the the main weaknesses I can see are opponents with a lot of spells that need to be countered but typically these are sorceries such as Armageddon hurricane Fireball even himor could be a problem so what's the most unique thing about this stack Oh by far the most interesting unique and Innovative card in Michael lantto deck is the hollowed ground this car can serve actually three purposes for him one he can use it on his mistress factories effectively turning them into blinking Spirits if the Stray attacks lantto can turn his mistress Factory into a creature and then with a hollowed ground block and then return it to his hand um also he can use it as protection from Armageddon if the Stray cast Armageddon if lantto has out the hollowed ground and enough white land he could be able to turn one two possibly even three cards to his hand thus negating the effects of the Armageddon and finally the hollowed ground can be used to allow him to land tax during his upkeep if they have the same number of land he can use the hollowed ground to pop one of his lands back into his hand giving him fewer than the Stray thus allowing him to land tax okay Henry it sounds like we've covered Michael lono's deck pretty well what kind of deck is brron lray gonna play brron lay is playing a 60c card green white eram Armageddon deck wait wait what do you mean by an erum Armageddon deck well erum Armageddon refers to the two uh most important cards in the deck the nnam Jin and the Armageddon uh his deck is really based around getting out a big creature such as the erum Jin or the Autumn Willow that he has or the Sarah Angel and then casting Armageddon when he casts Armageddon destroys all the Mana makes it very difficult for his opponent to deal with that big creature he has out there in addition to these big creatures he has a number of small creatures as well four elves a couple of orders of leap beer two spectral bearss a lot of times these small creatures can get out early and do some damage too wow that's a lot of offense but uh what does he have defensively well Patron's deck surprisingly has a very strong defensive element almost as strong as Michael lantto he also has four Swords to plow shares two outout the gods two I for is en chants and ab balance uh interestingly these decks share a lot of cards in common all of them white do you see any weakness in this deck design well one of the potential problems of this deck is that the only way he has of dealing damage is through creatures if his opponent is able to set up an effective creature defense he could find it very difficult to win I think hurricane or two could go a long ways in this type of deck another problem is that he's not playing with the feldon's cane and you notice how his deck is set up to cast Armageddon and he's also maybe using land tacks to draw the land out of his deck to thin it down in that type of deck you really want to have a felon cane to get a second chance at all that land and since Thea's playing a milstone deck I think for Tron will really wish he had a felons cane in his deck or in his sideboard okay Henry these two decks are about ready to go head tohe how do you think they're going to interact with one another well it's going to be a very interesting match for tron's going to try to quickly get out some creatures and hit Lano fast Lano is going to try to set up his defense and he really needs to get out to four land quickly because if for land is where most of his critical creature defense spells are the rra of God and the ice manator if brron can come up fast and maybe cast an arm again it'll be to his Advantage but if the game starts to stretch out long I think lanto is going to have the edge all right thanks a lot Henry for that analysis"

anyway back to what this video is really about this is going to be a well updated skincare routine I made two videos talking about skincare oh I have two videos on that so I will put links somewhere on this screen so that you guys can click to those videos and watch those first and see kind of how I was going through my journey my skincare regimen actually changes slightly um in the summertime as opposed to the wintertime and last time I made a video about skincare was in the wintertime so my regimen has kind of changed just a little bit not a lot but enough for me to make a video about it right stay tuned for the end of this video because I am doing my very first giveaway this company contacted me um to do a review and it's so funny because they contacted me but I don't think they actually had knowledge of the fact that I've actually used their products before so not only do I have a giveaway for some really great products but I've tried these products myself and I've used them and I like them so this is going to be you know and everybody wins kind of situation right right so stay tuned for the end of the video for the giveaway well if you've watched the videos before about my skin you know that I use the regimen from acne.org I do not use acne.org products but I do use um the drugstore alternative so first I start off with my Cetaphil daily cleanser for all skin types use this morning and night I love it and before I use this actually if I have on makeup before I go to bed at night time I make sure that I use my makeup wipes um so these are from Forever 21. you can pick up pretty much any makeup wipes just make sure you get all your makeup off because you don't want to be washing your face with this and it doesn't come off because this does not remove makeup at all this is very gentle so yeah it's not gonna remove your makeup so makeup wipes and then I use my Cetaphil always always always use witch hazel especially in the summertime it helps with my oil and it gets off the excess residue from the makeup after I use my witch hazel I let that you know soak in for a minute let it dry if I do have acne breakouts I'll use my on the go acne Spot Treatment by Neutrogena this has benzoyl peroxide in it it has that helps to get rid of the acne spots but I don't have to use it so I'm not breaking if I'm not breaking out and I have not been breaking out so I go on to my Moisturizer in the wintertime I was using my Josie Moran argan oil that I got in one of my Glam Bags and I really really like that worked perfectly for my face at that time because my face was kind of dry in some areas so the oil was kind of helping to combat some of the dryness but it's summertime my skin is oily as we all know so can't really do the oil anymore so lately instead of that I've been using cocoa butter no let me tell you guys the story when I got engaged that morning after everything happened I was curling my hair and I was so in shock like I was looking at my ring and I was like oh my and then I burnt my forehead it was a huge scar too it was like huge it was like that big when I was waiting for this scab to come off and trying to help it to heal I would use the cocoa butter and my mom told me to use this and I was like why don't I just use Mederma but my Mederma was expired so I was like okay let's just go the natural route so I went to the beauty supply store found me some Queen Helens um 100 cocoa butter sticks got like three of them and I've been just rubbing that on my scar ever since it's been healing and it has when I tell you it healed so fast like it literally you can't even tell that the scar is there anymore it looks that good and it was bad like it was bad plus because it's all natural and you know it doesn't have any extra oils or ingredients in it it doesn't make my skin oily so I've been putting it all over my face and it's been helping to fade some of my scars slowly but surely it doesn't work as good as some other products that I've used before but it does help before I put my makeup or attain a moisturizer on I make sure that I put some milk of magnesia all over my face guys if you have oily skin and you don't know what to do with it try this I promise you it will change and um yeah I think that's all for my skincare regimen now I'm gonna get to the giveaway okay this is exciting I'm so excited okay I know that I suffer from hyperpigmentation and I know a lot of black women suffer from hyperpigmentation and basically that's just when you're when your skin scars and things like that it leaves dark marks and you know sometimes your body will over produce pigmentation and cause for some of your skin to be darker than other parts of your skin for hyperpigmentation I've always looked for the perfect product that would help with getting rid of those dark spots and those dark marks I remember I was watching TV one day and I saw an RX for brown skin commercial and I was like I kind of want to try that it looks like maybe it'd be catered more to dark-skinned women so maybe it would help out my skin better I decided to order it and I ordered it online it is more of a subscription-based kind of thing where you order and they continue to send you products every two or three months um just to replenish what you had you know you do run out if you use it every day and so for about a year or so I was using your um brightening but Botanical brightener and their exfoliating serum that we're helping get rid of my dark spots and they work really really well kind of stopped using them after a while you'd want to change up your face products every now and then just because I know I do I don't know about you guys and even though I don't have any like periodic video footage or pictures showing like the transformation of my skin before and after hyperpigmentation isn't as bad anymore especially because I take care of my skin inside and out I make sure to exfoliate as well on top of that so using these products has helped but I want to advise you that it's not just the products that you use it's what you do with your body that helps to you know change the way your face is I love their products and I'm not just saying that because they sent these products to me I'm not going to use them I'm going to give them to you guys because I feel like they would be that well of a help for you if you have problems with hyperpigmentation the best thing about arts for brown skin products is that they are paraben free fragrance free oil free hydrenoquinone free and cruelty free so that makes them even that much better because you know that what you're putting on your face isn't a whole bunch of harsh chemicals that'll harm your skin that's why I love these and that's why these work so the Intensive exfoliating serum the advanced Botanical brightener these two products will be given away to one lucky winner who is excited about having beautiful skin if you want beautiful skin just leave a comment in the comment section below stating why you would like these products and how much beautiful skin means to you something like that I don't know be creative have fun with it go wild be fancy yes anyways I will randomly select a winner from the comment section below when that winner gets elected I will make a shout out video or put the shout out at the end of a video and I will make sure
