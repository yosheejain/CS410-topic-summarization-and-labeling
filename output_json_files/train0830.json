        "transcript": "[Music] today is with the engine and transmission back into our s mm chassis day however I'm rolling solo because Dave's at home with the flu so you're gonna have to bear with me while I try to do this one man one car I wouldn't recommend attempting this by yourself since having a second body around makes this job a million times easier and safer but with that being said if you're in my situation take your time because it's a tedious process as we're about to find out sliding the engine under the chassis is actually the easy part of this job lowering it and making sure none of the engine compartment hoses connectors and the chassis itself don't get hung up for contact the engine is the tricky part especially when it feels like I'm being rushed because the hoist is slowly lowering the car without me being able to stop it quickly it's a bit of a cat mouse game here as I'm running back and forth between a hoist and adjusting the engine so it slides into place I'm going to shut up here for a second and let you enjoy watching me nervously run back and forth crawling under the car and adjusting the engine ever so slightly until it settles into place but first we'd ourselves a proper soundtrack dudududududu did it it did to do that it up dude - doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo de doo it they did it dude I'm in the homestretch here finally yes getting close about to put the suffering bolts in but I'm gonna make sure to Lube them up put some anti-seize on them because we don't want a repeat of what we dealt with when we were taking out the old subframe use a nice ease it's this god that is so bad something is chewed up on this thread it's not the actual bolt that's a culprit so looks like I'm gonna have to switch over to doing this manually like I did having to pull it out which is gonna be a huge pain in the butt but we've got no other options at this point Dave you are lucky you're at home sick is now I have a task of taking care of this oh yes later now that's resistance a gun done that bolt I give it the middle finger salute I don't ever want to have to touch that one ever again there's so much work torquing the subframe bolts is an important step since I've read a lot of owners complaining that these bolts come loose so to be safe I add an extra 10 foot-pounds to the factory torque spec of 85 foot-pounds with the front subframe fastened in place I had to get a backup on jack stands which like every other task had me running around the car like a chicken with my head cut off [Music] yeah subframe engine in get your done now I got one more thing to do and that's the rear and then I'm calling it quits for today I've got a couple bullets left to fasten up on the old rear subframe before it's installed of course gonna be using liberal amounts of anti-seize on them the other thing that you'll notice right now is this subframe is missing a bunch of stuff like the control arms and they drive axles and all that we're waiting for some new seals for the diff which we didn't have and two bolts that are backordered from Honda that we had to destroy off the old subframe we've also got these lateral links on order because these old ones they're screwed they're not coming out of there so we're going to need new ones with the rear subframe there was very little drama since I could hoist it into place with the use of two jacks that still didn't mean it would bolt right in Oh No there was plenty of finesse needed and by finesse I mean a lot of violent shaking and of course I had to go make a mess of myself I got a nice easel over me damn you that's twice this hole seems way off good eventually I got the suffering lined up and bolted into place hallelujah just had it [Music] all right front subframe hung rear subframe hung I'm happy Dave he's at home sick so he can't be that happy but he'll be back soon enough anyways we've got a lot of cool parts coming down the pipeline so make sure you subscribe and stay tuned and as for the s2000 well it's not looking so ass anymore"

than the host dc's and i'm just curious about you know i understand when people are rage quit but why would you get damn near the end of the game and then you decide hey no i i play a lot of poker and when i'm pot committed when when you're that far invested in something you kind of should just see the outcome i mean i understand if you get [\u00a0__\u00a0] on repetitively which is probably the case shh but anyways i mean i don't understand why somebody can get that close to the end of something and quit it i mean i understand what somebody quits at the start but anyways it's just a pet peeve i'm like yeah yeah maybe he had to go maybe maybe his mom brought him some mcdonald's or something i have no clue no clue so anyways what i wanted to talk to you guys about today is i was thinking about this the other day i was thinking about this and uh i was like what did you want to be when you were growing up and you all you guys liked them i know you wanted to be a professional porn star no no i i know instead you know i ended up being a ponestar i know i know uh how dare i so uh the way it turns out is is as i was growing up i really didn't have any drive to be anything i didn't have any dreams well i did have dreams but they were me they were they're mainly consisting of naked celebrities but you know let's not get into that right now uh justin timberlake so uh i i had a lot of fun i i went to two of his concerts too i'm not proud i went to two backstreet boys too and a britney spears all it's not my choice at all growing up i had like a step sister that loved all that [\u00a0__\u00a0] and i knew all the songs by heart and still do you guys all acting like damn you were really gay in this video i had no clue um don't act like you know backstreet boys pops on the radio you don't know the lyrics don't even don't even play so i know them all it's all kids okay so uh put that on my resume for impressive [\u00a0__\u00a0] so right under i carry a 3kb i know backstreet boy lyrics so uh anyways oh man i'm super super gay super so uh anyways what what did i want to be while growing up you know i didn't have too many uh too many things that i didn't have that drive to you know oh yeah i wanted to be something it wasn't like yeah so uh you know um i just now graduated kindergarten i'm on my way to get my phd it's not like you know some of those kids are ready right out the gate like yeah i'm gonna be an astronaut or i want to be a firefighter kids just develop and they change their ideas in between what they want to be and i wasn't sure i wasn't you know i never expected to do youtube i mean who honestly would have thought you know that this was this was the days where why are you on that [\u00a0__\u00a0] video game you little chick you should be taking your shower and she unplugs my pokemon and then i hit her with a frying pan you know that was just the mother-son relationship that i had and uh you know that's that's what it was you know video games were looked down on you know just a waste of life you know you should play them casually but instead you play them ritually so that's that's how it was so i never expected video games to become a a job for me or possibly even a career i never thought i'd get to meet people go through organizations companies meet things and see how video games have actually turned into and youtube has turned into a source of entertainment to the point that this thing could be going on for years and years and years and i could i could make something of this i actually have an opportunity now and i think it's weird because i think it took to the point that something had to present itself for me to be like oh so that's what i want to do so i think i just i just had so many things i was good at because initially there was a bad car accident that ruined it i was really really excelling in a couple different sports and i was on my way to travel to brazil actually to get you know specific training i don't know maybe they have better you know teachers or something over there for soccer aka football and uh so uh you know i had a lot of potential growing up i had a lot of things that i wanted that i had fun doing but there was not like a job or a dream career that i wanted so i wanted to ask you guys if there's any been any sort of transitions what you wanted to be when you were a kid or what you want to be now because i really missed that whole thing i never really had a drive i never wanted to grow up and be like i want to be a ceo [\u00a0__\u00a0] of one company i wanted to be the guy that brought call of duty down to its knees oh wait jd 2020. it's not like i i ever wanted to uh you know be something big i mean you know i've never had the dreams i mean my only two dreams growing up were i wanted to be the best father possible and i wanted to be the best husband and you know i i set simple dreams but those are dreams that you you embark on and you you cover over a lifetime those aren't dreams that you're like oh yeah it's may 22nd i became the best father ever like like why because if you bought your kid the new playstation 9 i mean it's like it's like that's not something i could do at once so that's something i want to look back on my life at the end of my life and been like yopon you did good man you did good you backpacked for days you're amazing and uh so so i don't i never had any goals that i could achieve in a relatively decent amount of time i always had major life goals so that's just kind of where i was i mean i always wanted to be a writer writing was one of my gifts i hate writing but i was good at it so i wanted to be it if that made any sense but there wasn't anything i really had a passion for besides sports but that kind of went down the drain after a bad car accident messed up my back so you know that's my question to you guys today if you guys had any sort of like dreams or goals or lives and then careers and have they changed at all so get back to me guys let me know if you think about justin timberlake in your dream too get it that's so good"

        "transcript": "hi guys welcome to another SS transformer prime video this is a hints and tips video about resetting the transformer prime if you're having any particular issues say for example your screen is doing the glitch earthing or your sounds not working are you just generally having some problems of a transformer Prime and you think just turning it off and turning it back on is not going to resolve it there is something called the hard reset which I'm going to show you how to do now obviously the first thing you need to do is turn off your tablet so if you just hold the power button as normal and then press it ok to shoot it down it'll go through it's turning off process when you turn it back on there are two things you need to do in particular first thing is you need to make sure that it's not plugged into any power sockets and then the second thing you need to do is press two buttons on boot-up you'll need to press the power button here and also the volume button it down at the same time and hold it for as long as you can essentially when you're holding it that's going to trigger a different type of boot and when you know it's going to boot some text will come up in the top left hand corner here when I boost I will now demonstrate and hopefully this will work so hold the power button and volume up at the same time which I'm now doing I've felt that it's Rumble so it is booting up so there we are as you can see the text came up in the top left hand corner which shows that it's going to go to a different boot screen and this is a different boot screen two options here you can have the hard reset and wipe old data if you wanted to select that one you would use the volume button to move on to there obviously I don't want to do that I want to leave it where it is and as you can see now is come up with cold booting which means that it's doing a hard reset not wiping any data it's just removing all the cache turn around and starting afresh so they are Asus Transformer Prime should hopefully fix any issues that it was currently having how we find that video useful if you have any questions please do ask me and I'll see you on another video thanks very much for watching you"

        "transcript": "[Music] hey everybody Steve Cook with Premier Guitar and Premier guitar.com today we are doing a review demo on a beautiful Peerless retromatic four string semih hollow body base guitar say that one more time it is uh as you can see it's beautiful if the Peerless retromatic looks slightly familiar to you you are not far off Peerless has been making instruments for other manufacturers for about 40 years out of Korea and they have recently launched their own product lines uh this is a stunner 34in base semih hollow design we've got uh staggered headstock bone nut mother of pearl inlays rolling up the Rosewood fingerboard Maple neck um laminated top sides and back we've got this nice aged triple binding all the way around the semih hollow body running down the middle of the retromatic is a mahogany block and uh we've got these bad boys which are Bas humbuckers designed by Matt gleon at Monty's guitars over in England um or if you're in England watching this then not far from you uh the controls are pretty straightforward we've got volume we've got tone and we have a six-way chicken head selector switch which has preset eqs on it so you can dial in some different things on the base selector switch which gets you between the neck and the bridge pickup and then a combination of the two today's signal chain is extremely simple we're going from the retromatic into the agular 350 tone Hammer with the direct out also a Royer R11 microphone running through the apog quartet in the Protools this demo base was sent with flat wound strings now we don't get a lot of bases with Flats uh here at PG um so it's kind of a breath of fresh air but the flats really bring out the tonal characteristics and the overall character of this great base so right now we're going to use both humbuckers in the neutral position and uh this is dimed volume dime tone control [Music] [Music] and as you can hear it sustains for days now we're going to get a little more aggressive uh we throw it in the bridge pickup mode and it'll [Music] tonally it opens it up but it still stays [Music] tight now we'll move to the neck pickup [Music] all right so let's talk about the uh the very tone as they call it v a r i tone uh very tone switch down here this is a six position switch right now we're in neutral and so I'm going to use the great sustain on this Bas and I'm going to hold a note and then I'm going to kind of scroll through you so you can hear the tonal differences very subtle nuances but you'll be able to hear from first position all the way last position how much it changes this is first [Music] position and as you can hear it's getting a little bit more mellow [Music] so as you can see and here the retromatic B2 from Peerless is pretty unique it's got that whole vintage Vibe happening I love that it has the flat wound strings on it that sort of helps it find its voice with rounds you know stainless steel strings I would imagine that it opens up a little bit but I love the melatone I love the uh the place where this thing sits and uh again with the six-way technically five-way selector switch um you can really find your place in the mix so for Premier guitar.com my name is Steve Cook make sure you watch this video again just because and go to our YouTube channel And subscribe and you can watch hundreds of other video reviews just like this one thanks so much [Music] don't forget to sign up for PG perks your all access pass to exclusive gear giveaways and discounts on premier guitar.com"

        "transcript": "hi and welcome to Robins in this film I'm going to talk you through the features of our Voyager 2 ex which is in our Trail Range so you can see here that the Voyager 2 ex is based on the Voyager 2 but the ex is for this extended porch area at the front so it sleeps two people and it's a tunnel design tent with it being in our uh Trail Range you'll find that we're using our hydrotex HD fly sheet which is a real high density good quality polyester material which has got pu ctin on the inside it has fully taped seams and a hydrostatic head of 5,000 mm so it's totally waterproof um the frame that we use for the tent is made of these T6 alloy poles um and these have been anodized just to stop them from corroding you'll also find that we color code the pole sleeves just to make sure that you're going to get the right pole in the right place so pitching is very very simple um and all of the uh poles they start on the outside and then they're transferred into these flat pole sleeves across the top here so that keeps the tent very aerodynamic and it means that it's also nice and stable as well in terms of stability um that's added to with these Robin guy lines here which are always red and on the inside of them you'll find that we've put some reflective points uh so that when you've got your head torch on you're going to be able to see these nice and easily and another thing that we pop on the guidelines are these clam cleat Runners so they're really really easy to adjust and they self loock as well like so all the guidelines have got their own retainers so when it comes to packing down the tent we can wrap these up and just pop them in here so that the next time you come to use the tent they're easily accessible and then all the pegging points all the way around the tent are also adjustable as well other features that you'll find on here we have some ventilation on the front door and there's another large ventilation panel towards the back as well um and what we've also done is we've put some ventilation on the bottom of the tent whereby you can roll up the external fly sheet here and just toggle that up so that you get really good through flow with the tent being uh the extended porch version of the Voyager 2 that's enabled us to put a front door and a side door on here so good versatility for getting in and out of the tent as well so that's the features on the outside now we'll just pop inside and show you the features of the inner as we mentioned earlier on the Voyager 2 ex sleeps two people comfortably in the inner tent the inner tent itself is made from a breathable polyester on the upper and that's a riptop polyester the ground sheet is made from a 75 denier poly taet material which is really tough going to last a long time and it has a hydrostatic head of 10,000 mil the door for the inner tent when zipped open can just easily be rolled up and stored in this pocket here and you'll find that there is a mosquito net on the front door as well other features on the inside are these small uh mesh storage Pockets here which are ideal for smaller personal belongings and at the rear of the tent you'll find we have a mesh ventilation panel which corresponds to external ventilation on the tent and then running across across the top we have a gear line which is ideal for hanging up smaller wet clothing or any head torches or lanterns the ground sheet that you can see in the porch area here is an optional extra for you just for a extra little bit of protection in there so that's all the features of our Voyager 2 ex thank you very much for watching"

        "transcript": "hey guys for this video I'll be reviewing the game between Arsenal and West Brom okay so the final score was Arsenal 2 West Brom nil the two goals came from two penalties about time we've actually C some penalties for us we always seem to give them away and man united Man City and all those teams seem to get them a lot more than we do so it's about time that we got some two in one game is pretty handy takes the pressure off ARS Dinger and the rest of the team now we got a win we played really positively we were attacking well we actually created space we were very creative finally cazola was great willsher was unbelievable that is one of the best performances from a player that I've seen in a very long time every time he got the ball he did something with it he defended magnificently and he attacked brilliantly and it was just an allround unbelievable performance if you want to be a midfielder then you watch the way he played tonight because it was just unbelievable that's that's that's the only word I can really use cuz it was that good he really did deserve a goal towards the end he deserved a couple of goals he he could have set up three or four others as well it's great to see him hitting form now he's had a few games in the Premier League after his injury so he seems to be getting a good feel of the game so the two goals as I said from artetta two penalties the first one was in the 26th minute it came from a cazola trip he he fell he dived I I never like seeing that happening in the games for you know in any game especially when it's an Arsenal player but I figured we've been we've been playing pretty poorly lately we're struggling to kick goals who cares he fell give us the penalty we scored man United do it every week a lot of other teams do it Gareth Bale and the commentators didn't stop talking about it for about 45 minutes the whole rest of the first half they were just saying that it's terrible and it should be rubbed out of the game and apparently on Fox Sports a lot of people tweeting that um the commentators there were saying that he should be suspended for 8 weeks that's kind of he has never done it before I know he's going to be labeled as a diver now but he's he's probably never going to do it again it's just something that happens Split Second decision who cares the ref paid it we got the goal in the 64th minute bit of luck again Chamberlain seemed to have faou the West Brom player I thought it was a foul but he kept the play going and I thought okay no worries and then Chamberlain was clearly fouled in the Box it was tripped this time it was a real trip and arteta took the penalty again and he scored but to be fair I I think if we had have won by four or five goals we wouldn't even be talking about the penalties as much as we are now it's because they were the two deciding goals it was 2-0 it wasn't 4 5 nil if it was that then I think that we wouldn't be glossing over as much as we are now because they are important goals they they did cost West Brom the game in general play I thought we dominated we created so many chances I thought javino was actually really good today he deserved a goal he had a few chance he had about four chances that were genuine chances usually he's got half chances here and there but he actually created a few chances for himself and I like that every time he got the ball on the left he didn't Corral himself into the corner flag and you have no space to get out of he actually cut in as soon as he could and just opened up the play completely and there were players running in left running right and he just had so many angles to work with and that's how javino likes to play and I like the way he played today and hopefully he can keep it up as well at the back we were pretty stable the first half was a bit shaky but the second half we were pretty easy going P from towards the end we made a few errors because we were trying to pass it slowly just by some time but I thought all around it was a great performance shz didn't really have to touch the ball as much as he has in the past couple of weeks it was a good response we could see that the players had purpose the last couple of weeks they were clueless but we had purpose today when we got the ball we knew what to do with it even if it didn't come off at all times they had a game plan anyway guys that's it for me comment below tell me what you think of the games I'll reply to all your comments please like the video below it does really help me out and subscribe above if you want to see more thanks n"

        "transcript": "[Music] how's up you guys I'm goi and welcome back to Destiny the house of wolves is just around the corner and today I thought I could talk you guys through everything we know about the house of wolves so far before we begin keep in mind that everything I'm about to say is subject to change so take the information Miss with a ground of salt we will have a look at everything story missions strikes raids bounties Exotics Crucible maps and more the house of wolves is an expansion focused around the fallen and the queen of the reef personally I think the Fallen is one of the most interesting enemies in the game and everything about the queen is a big mystery so I hope you get to know a bit more about the F and the queen herself first up we're going to take a look at the story missions so far there's been three story missions which have been leaked and if you compare them to the leaked image back from January this seems to be the only missions we get the first mission is called gone to ground which takes place in Old Russia it description says search a cosmodrome for the wolf Kell who led the revolt against the awoken the second mission is called Wolf's Harvest which takes place in the isar sink on Venus his description says track down the Queen's traitorous wolves hiding among the house of Winter the third mission is called the Terminus which takes place on Venus its description says hunt down the Wolves Kell who have ceased control over the VAC Citadel there are apparently L some bounties which is connected to the story missions which can give us more information about the story line the first Bounty is called paskin King Baron where you have to defeat pasin King Baron in the G to ground mission in the cosmo drob the second Bounty is called lixar wolf blade where you have to defeat lior wolf blade in the wolf Harvest mission on Venus the third Bounty is called skolas wolf Kell where you have to defeat skolas wolf Kell in the Terminus mission on Venus my guess is that we're going to have some sort of a vendor just like arism to dish out certain bounties and quest lines for the house of wolf story line let's have a look at the new strike the strike is called the belly of the Beast which takes place on the moon his description says a fallen wool ship holding an Infamous Walker has touched down in the ocean of storms breach to catch and see to this Walker's end you can already glitch your way into the area where this strikes takes place and you can actually see some gameplay of it in the background right now my guess is that we're going to fight a walker at the end of the strike I personally think that Walkers is one of the better bosses in the game the reason for that is because it's a bit more selda likee where you have to shoot him in the legs before you get to deal even more damage into the weak spot this makes the boss less bullet spongy and a more enjoyable boss fight we will also get a new Vanguard playlist called Vanguard Dragon which will launch a random strike at level 28 next up let's have a look at a new raid coming in the house of wolves for the time being the raid is called the arena which takes place in The Reef the description says test yourself this makes me super excited on so many levels s first of all it's a new raid but we're finally able to play around in the reef the only time we have visited the reef before is in a cut scene which we're forced to watch for them again to leave what we have seen from certain Leakes is that we may see modifiers in the raid as well just as we do in the nightall strikes I personally think this is going to be a really cool raid and I can't wait to go in there with my RAID team and kick some ass some of the newer leaks shows us that we may get a new Social Hub which is set in The Reef as much as I loow the tower on Earth I seem to think that will be really cool to have a second Social Hub you may already have a tiny Glimpse on how the reef Social Hub looks like if you go back in time back to the E3 demo in 2013 where we can see a hunter walking around in the reef in third person without any weapons now if this is true I have a lot of questions will The Reef Social Hub have their own cryp tar or their own Vanguard vendors will your show up in the reef and what about poor Tess Everest the vendor which is in the tower but no one pays attention to Bunchie please next up let's have a look at the exotic armor which is coming with the House of wolves expansion each class is getting three new armor pieces and the warock gets an exotic helmet called the ram its unique perk the ram arises disorients nearby enemies when you're activating Radiance from Death warlocks also get a new chest piece called purifier robes its unique perk burn brighter makes enemies to explode by your ignite effects warlocks also get a new pair of gauntlets called Nothing manacles it's Unique perk they called equation grants your Shield every time you kill someone with your Void light abilities next up let's have a look at the new Exotics for the Titan titans gets a helmet called a Thal Warrior its unique perk Resolute provides Unstoppable for fist of Havoc Titans also get a new pair of gauntlets called acdo feedback fence it's Unique perk rat conductors deals damage in an area around you if you're taking damage from a melee attack Titans also get a new pair of boots called perin Graves it's Unique perk perin strike gives troll charge bonus damage when it's activated in the air and finally let's have a look at the Exotic gear for the hunter hunter gets a new helmet called exotac Angel Hunter its unique perk Angel Hunter significantly increases your weapons accuracy for a short time after jumping Hunters also get a new pair of gauntlets called ikaika hooks its unique perk Touch of Venom deals additional damage over time if you hit an enemy while invisible Hunters also get a new pair of boots called unremarkable bones its unique perk not bound by law upgrades double jump with an additional jump let's have a look at exotic weapons which comes with the house of wolves expansion I'm going to be quite surp surprised if this is the only new exotic weapons in the expansion but this is what we know about so far we have an exotic Scout rifle called 347 Vesta Dynasty and an exotic shotgun called lord of wolves I'm not going to go in much detail about these weapons in this video but this is what we know about so far let's have a look at what we can look forward to when it comes to The Crucible there are supposedly four new Crucible Maps which is coming in the house of wolves and the first map is called widow's Court whiches Place in the European Dead Zone on Earth next up we have a map called Black Shield which takes place on Firebase Tera on foboss we also have a map called t St which is set in the isar sink on Venus and a map called the timekeeper which is set in Meridian Bay on Mars there's also a play mode called hardcore but there's not much information to find about it yet now there are also some other interesting news that we know will change in the house of wolves Bun's game designer Luke Smith talked about some of the changes which is coming in this expansion in a post of Neo first up we have exotic weapon and armor upgrades when the dark blow came out you got the chance to upgrade your Exotics to match the new stats by trading in your current exotic with a large amount of glimmer and an exotic Shard if you handed in a fully upgraded exotic you then had to re-up grade it Luke Smith says that this was a mistake and it is something you don't have to do again in the house of wolves Luke Smith also said that selling level 31 armor and making your hard-earned raid armor completely redundant was a mistake and this is something they will try to prevent in this expansion I guess there is one question that we all want to answer to and that is when is the house of wolves coming out the news leaks indicates that May 19th may be a possible date what bu have said is that the house of woles is coming out in quarter 2 and I personally think that May 19th is fairly accurate we'll also have a patch before the release of the House of wolves which comes out sometime in April that patch includes more w space audio adjustments color blind mode and more My Pal and fellow YouTuber more console have made a video where he goes through this patch in more detail you'll find a link to that video in the Des description box below and that my friends is everything we know about the house of wolves so far this expansion is shaping up to be a really cool expansion and I can't wait to put a lot of time into it so guys thank you very much for watching let me know what you think about this video in the comment section below and let me know what you think of me making this kind of video this is something I usually don't do but when I do I want to put some effort into it also let me know what you think about the expansion so far in the comments below so guys thank you very much for watching and I'll next time leave a like leave a comment hit subscribe and I see you all in a lat big time so stay awesome [Music]"

We have a chrome clip on the pen with a red stripe running through the center of\nthe chrome clip. You can see the profile of the clip. It is just a standard clip on the cap of the pen. Then there's a large chrome band at the bottom of the pen or the bottom\nthe cap. We have the Plaisir logo and Platinum Japan on the backside with some other decorative engravings\naround the band. It has a shiny metallic finish to it. It is an\nactual metal pen but it's pretty lightweight for a metal pen. on a cap on apparent simply snaps of The pen doesn't post real well. You can\nset the cap on the pen but there is nothing to told the cap on. So if you'd rather write without the pen posted you can do that as well. Now the grip section on the pen is just a clear transparent grip\nsection. So as the ink flows through this section of the pen you can see the ink in the pen.  The other thing is pretty cool about the\nPlaisir pen is the nib. The nib on the pen\nwill match whatever color the rest of the pen is. So if you have\na red pen you're going to get a red nib.\nIf it's a yellow pen it's going to have a yellow nib which is pretty cool. I\nlike the different colors on the nibs on the Platinum Plaisir fountain pen. To change the ink on the Platinum\nPlaisir pen you simply unscrew the nib section from the barrel. Included\nwith the pen is going to be one ink cartridge. There's no converter with\nthe pen. Included is just simply an ink cartridge.\nSo you can replace that ink cartridges other colors if you would  rather do that. This is a fairly\ninexpensive pen but it's a sharp-looking and a great\nvalue. Get your Platinum Plaisir fountain pen at\nPenChalet.com!"

        "transcript": "hey guys it's Aaron the ho and today we are going to do the full review for The Catalyst waterproof case for the iPhone 5 and the 5S this is one of my most favorite iPhone cases out of the dozens and dozens that we've reviewed but it's not going to be the everyday uh rugged iPhone case that I'm going to recommend and I'm going to elaborate on that in a bit it has to deal with the drop protection of the case we gave the Catalyst a score of 4.06 a out of 5 which is still pretty high given that there is a pretty big caveat and really the only case that is better based on our usage is actually the LifeProof nude now we are given one of these cases away Catalyst has agreed to uh send one of you guys one of these cases so do stay tuned to figure out how to enter that draw real usage Real reviews Mobile reviews a.ca so before we rate our cases we actually spend time with them it's a novel idea I know uh but we've unboxed it we've installed it we've taken a closer look at some of the unique features of the case we've dropped it as well as drowned it and we are going to compare it against other cases now this isn't the first Catalyst case that we've reviewed we' reviewed the Survivor plus Catalyst and they're kind of generally the same shape however there's a lot of improvements to the Catalyst case over the Survivor plus Catalyst and that's that's really exciting to me because it just shows that you know catalyst is a company that is trying to improve their product unlike some other cases like the life proof cases whose screen protectors are exactly the same despite being Pixy rainbowy oh don't get me started on that the Catalyst provides great screen accessibility incredible water proofing at 16.4 ft it's pretty easy to install and it's fairly cheap at 65 bucks and the touch ID memory on the case looks way better than the plasty sticky looking membranes on other cases things that aren't great about the catalyst is that the fact that there is a higher chance that your iPhone might come out during a 6ot drop there is a bit of glare coming from the screen protector and the fact that you got to pay $15 for a headphone jack extension if your headphones don't fit into the hole in the bottom of the catalyst so you take a $65 case you add $15 that's an $80 case so if you have to include all those things that's really not that much cheaper sorry also the headphone jack extension is not waterproof so we're going to take the next few minutes and we're going to go over the big points um about the Catalyst waterproof case now if you need a complete breakdown over all the scores we rate everything against 9 to 10 uh scores depending on the case um do check out the website review we've got a comprehensive table for the catalus waterproof case descriptions are or the links are in the description section Below in terms of design the catalyst is one of the lightest least bulky cases that we've reviewed installing the case is a cinch but you do need to be careful since the installation process isn't completely foolproof the case has no rubber bumpers around it so every drop or scratch will show up on the case in terms of protection the Catalyst case is waterproof up to 16.4 ft and that's the deepest depth of all the everyday wed cases that we we've reviewed the only other cases that allow your iPhone to go deeper are the hitcase pro in the optic xd5 and as you can see they're in a completely different class when compared to the Catalyst now when it comes to drop protection this case the catalyst is rated up to 6.6 ft and it meets um according to Catalyst the mill standard 810g for shock and drop now if you've been following our coverage of the Catalyst case you'll know that the back of the case actually came came flying off during one of our drop test at about 6 ft now the case didn't come apart all the time so I ask you guys what do you guys think about the drop test did it pass or not Jen's life 09 said no as there's way too many wh ifs for the case Sam chonic said I don't think you should trust it lny said don't not worth it on Facebook Leonardo and Luigi said no as well now there are some people who did say yes such as Tommy Bobby and so did creepy couple pasta Megan 554 also said it passes but not 100% which I completely agree because 4 and a half successful drops out of six isn't great you would expect six out of six successful drops but it's still going to protect your iPhone from generic everyday drops now I did reach out to the Catalyst and the reply that I got was that as long as the device isn't damaged and the case isn't damaged then it's considered drop proof to the advertised height so there you have it they also did say that I would be hardpressed in finding other comparable cases that wouldn't come come apart occasionally uh during other 6foot drops Aron be nice no I have to be nice no no this is the first time that this has happened on our Channel I was excited when it came apart now other cases that have survived multiple 6ot drops the Autobox preserver the Incipio Atlas the Life prooof free the life prooof nude Catal is Survivor plus catalst survived a 6ot drop the lunatic tactic extreme the hitcase pro the opx xd5 the CD OBC Pelican Vault C 1180 the ballistic Hydra The Lunatic strike all these cases survived multiple six- foot drops and they didn't come apart I felt good so if you're thinking about getting the Catalyst case that is really the only caveat this is the only case that has come apart on US during one of our drop tests so you kind of have to wait how much are you actually going to drop it from six feet that's kind of where the case would come apart from that height from what we've seen um you're every day coming out of your pocket and it falls out there's a good chance that the iPhone is going to be protected by the case so you know you got to weigh those that risk now in terms of accessing your iPhone the catalyst is great voice calls aren't muted the sound coming from the speakers is actually pretty good despite the fact that there is no hold for the sound to come out of at the bottom of the speaker um our close-up video has an explanation of why this actually works all the sound functions of the case perform as well or better than the life prooof nude the touch ID membrane does its job fairly well now I did have a bit of trouble during the install video it's not a problem with the case it's a problem with how I put my thumb on the sensor you just kind of have to change how you do it minor G for me is that the true tone flash hole I don't think is big enough so the edges of your flash photos are going to be slightly discolored in terms of the screen protector there is a bit of glare to deal with but you guys prefer the Catalyst over the free during one of our Facebook polls so I guess the score is better than average you really can't feel the gap between the the touchcreen and the screen protector and also there are no annoying rainbowing effects which is great so again that's all we got for the Catalyst waterproof iPhone case got a big cave it for the drop protection but it still gets a score of 4.06 A's out of five because it is a very good case if this is the first time you're watching one of our videos I do encourage you to click subscribe our channel is all about helping you get the most out of iOS so product reviews news tips and tricks you know this video is all about helping you figure out if you want to get the Catalyst or not we put out two to three videos week it's actually probably more but I'm going to say two to three to make myself give myself a reason to sometimes slack off during the week now for the draw catalyst is awesome enough to give one of you guys one of the viewers one of these cases now in order to enter that draw you are going to have to use Twitter you're going to have to go to Mobile reviews a Twitter page you're going to follow us and then you're going to send us a tweet telling us which color that you would uh prefer to have your choices are Alpine white radiant Orchard Pacific Blue which is the one I'm holding and Ste black now there are a few more things that you need to do you need to take a picture of something that is awesome right could be anything I don't really care but it has to be a picture of something awesome as well as using the hashtags Catalyst lifestyle Catalyst case and uh waterproof hasht waterproof now I know that seems like a lot of things to do for this case but hey I had to work to get this case I had to work to get this review you guys have to work to get this case as well um I made it easy go to our web page I've got a list of all the steps that you need to do um again a picture of something awesome you need to include that if you have any questions about this case um ask them in the comment section below or find us on Facebook Twitter as well as Google Plus I'm Aaron the ho I think I'm done talking um keep your iPhone generally safe extremely dry uh with the catless waterproof case and generally drw proof generally um thank you for watching [Music]"

        "transcript": "hey guys welcome back to another video tutorial today I'm going to show you how to create a peacock nail using CND vinylux so to begin with we're going to need to apply two coats of CND vinylux in blackpool make sure that they're nice and even and while this is still wet we're going to take CND vinylux in lime eight and we're going to apply some drips straight out of the bottle onto the wet surface of our blackpool starts to pulled and then using a thumb palette or tile got my live acts on pilot here I'm going to place some water park purple purple and lock it love I think this one is yep look at love and using a dotting tool I'm going to take my waterpark and just place a dot into my limeade that I've created on the surface of this now and then we're going to do the same with locket love into the center of our blue circle that we've just created doesn't need to be a lot you just need that little petra gold there and then on top of that we're going to place a small dot purple purple my other base now if you wanted to to leave that as is can see it gives you a peacock effect or you can take a small detailing brush and the way that the polishes flowed and settled on the surface of this nail you can take your detailing brush and drag through that feather you can do it on a few random ones they can leave some as is or you can leave you can do it to all of them or you can leave some of them just as they are okay once you've left out to dry for a few minutes you apply a top see at your vinyl that's top coat and you're done two designs all set and see what here's something I've done earlier that are all waiting the top coat so while I'm waiting for that one too dry I'll apply top coat to these three remember we're news in vinylux unlike normal polish we give this a good shake much like we do with shellac shake the bottle side to side a nice generous coat of top coat and then it dries completely in eight and a half minutes you've enjoyed this tutorial today guys don't forget to subscribe keep watching i'll be uploading more videos soon and have a good weekend see you later guys thanks"

        "transcript": "The talent behind blockbuster N64 shooters\nGoldenEye and Perfect Dark left Rare in the late 90s, and went on to form development\nstudio Free Radical. This company was responsible for my favourite\nFPS series of last generation, TimeSplitters. Those weren't the only games they made, however. There was also the much less known hidden\ngem, Second Sight. This game takes 44th place on the list of\nDefinitive 50 GameCube games. Second Sight is a third person shooter which\nfollows the bizarre, twisting, and cerebral journey of parapsychology research John Vattic. The game begins with Vattic confined to a\nhospital room, heavily bandaged, and without memory. As he works his way toward escape, Vattic\nslowly remembers how he got to this bizarre state, and relearns some powerful psychic\nabilities along the way. It turns out Vattic began this journey as\nan advisor on a military mission to Siberia investigating the work of Russian scientist\nVictor Grienko. John finds that he's able to change the details\nof this mission as he remembers it, and the twisting plot slowly unravels in one of the\nsmartest written games to date. As strong as the plot may be in this game,\nit doesn't entirely cover for some awkward gameplay. Switching between different weapons and psychic\npowers becomes tedious quickly. The game's mechanics work well for its heavy\nstealth emphasis, but falter when action boils over. The perpetual streams of re-spawning enemies\nare especially annoying. Still, Second Sight is a beautifully constructed\ngame. It's a refreshingly intelligent and subdued\nexperience next to other first and third person shooters that doesn't bother with unnecessary\nor tacked-on extras like multiplayer. Let me know what you think of Second Sight\nand the Definitive 50 in the comments section below. Also, subscribe to this channel, rate this\nvideo, check out our Facebook and Twitter pages. Links below. Huge thanks go out to sulci and Amanda T for\nour intro. sulci did the animation and Amanda T did the\nmusic. Check back next week for Definitive 50 GameCube\nGame #43."
