time uh john park lost his throw he came back with a two one eighties and an 11 dart leg not this time 40. still to come in this afternoon session barry bates 38 against andy smith should be uh should be a good game as well andy smith's another one who got here in spite of flooding in his part of the world warwickshire i mentioned terry jenkins earlier resident in memphis and i think that particular town has been virtually cut off he managed to get through i don't know how perhaps he's a good swimmer as well as a good player will this be his first john part here planting them in unlucky again he thought that was in didn't he he has won three out the last four legs warren i'm sure he'll come down 100 absolutely brilliant absolutely brilliant darts this could be useful another one of those leaves double 10 for another brilliant finish from one and a little oh again just out how he needed it as well magic little spell that one seven one from park to set up 16 and then one in a little almost takes out 128 and that is the fourth leg in a row to go against throw and john park will be throwing now in the 15th leg for the match and a place in round two of the stan james world match play here in blackpool and part against teddy jenkins in the second round a match worthy of a semi or a final stuart yeah that's uh tuesday 140. that will be the first two second round matches on tuesday night marvel against scholten and it looks like jenkins against part unbelievable entertainment well if it's jenkins against warren a little we will witness in the next half hour or so one of the greatest recoveries not impossible but improbable in the light of the way they're throwing and in the light of the bad look that warren is having 40. well he's still got a sense of humour he looked at the dart there just said thank you well it gave a double twist there i know you get 5.9 for at least for that i think in the gymnastics world i don't know whether they'll make colin uh lee coach manchester is watching he loves watching the darts i know but uh he'll have seen that wonderful wonderful double warrior well a resigned shake at the head from uh mrs warrener there 105 so 104 job part to close out this match 91 john 100 it is for a place in round two so trouble 20 double 20. can hardly call it a marker so 130 for one in a little allen you require one to stay in the match play now got to get trouble 20. got to get the ball oh it was in the 25. it was in the 25. it wasn't in the ball in fairness but again another bouncer so uh john park will just steady himself here faulty walk up to the hockey take game fires and part is into the second round great performance from the canadian an average of 95 warren goes out and it's part against jenkins in round two the canadian wins 10-5 john part is here congratulations just just took us through that that much it looked pretty comfortable in the end well i was solid uh through the match and i felt good about it um i have enough experience to know don't let things slide away because somebody can get hot especially another experienced player like allen is and he's actually he's struggled a bit of late but only on the results he's actually throwing very well he's hitting a lot of 140s a lot of 180s just the odd doubles tripping him up and uh so i i played him last month actually we had one of the best matches i've ever played and i came through it but still it didn't make me happy i came through it to have to play him again if you know what i mean because he played so well i didn't want to have to beat him again is it extra pressure knowing you know everybody's going to say oh john paul will win that easily john paul no no that didn't bother me at all i'm sure i was a favorite i i am pretty much in form and i feel good and i'm throwing well and i one of my best matches ever when i lost to raymond in vegas a few weeks ago and i think i probably could have won the whole thing just to wire are two different but you don't worry about that you just get on with it and i'm playing well so i wasn't i wasn't worried about what if i'm the favorite or not i i'm almost getting past that which is nice um you've got terry jenkins next and terry jenkins is another man who's in terrific form right now finalist in vegas of course well he was the finalist but i think i played the final with raymond yeah you did his hard work did you hear that now he's a great player and he's steady and he's he's i like his company and he takes my jibes perfectly well and that's that's what's nice he's he's um you gonna play it tough against me and i know that and i just have to play solid i think if i play solid like today i have a very good chance we're just having a look at the stats actually your three dot average you check out percentage yours and his from your first round matches is almost identical which we should say if you played similar it would be very very tight indeed well that's true that's true but i think i have um i think i have it inside me that to respond in situations and i've proven it over the years and i'm not saying terry doesn't have that but i think he's just a little newer than i am and i'm hoping that's the difference good to see you playing so well congratulations john part through the the second round of the competition"

        "transcript": "-The 5th generation was [unk] show. Can I say [unk] show? I have to look at my notes. That's how much of a [unk] show was. 3DO in '93, Atari Jaguar in '93, then finally the playstation. There's too many players here. There's too many players in the 5th generation. Some things got to give. -It really was a fascinating time. So many people found companies like 3DO and Sega all moved to Nintendo or to Sony and both of them just became major powerhouses for the next several years. -I think history chosen the Nintendo 64 is one of the stranger systems ever created. -1964-- -On the one, it lost. The playstation was far more successful than the N64. On the other hand, it run arguably, the two best video games ever made. Super Mario 64, a launch game for the N64. And then a few years after that, Legend of Zelda, The Ocarina of Time and then you can't forget GoldenEye. And suddenly, you know, the Nintendo 64 is a staple of college dorm rooms and drinking and it's one of these things that you are sitting there with passing the control around playing nonstop. -But something dramatic happened in the next generation, the 32-bit generation Sony showed up. -The Walkman people have the nerve to come out with this Playstation. As as a Sega kid talking to my Nintendo enemies suddenly [unk] his Playstation I have watched. -For several years in my career with Sega when we heard a big company like Sony was gonna get into the game in mystery, it was laughable. -Fly, plaything, fly. You're not ready. -And then when the Playstation first came out, we were all pretty blown away and quite frankly pretty scared. But what it was? Was Sony making a calculated effort that you know whether you see Microsoft, camera, and DVD exact same thing, then saying we are coming in here. We're seeing with this market isn't worth taking our claim in it. This is kind of an accidental way. They were supposed to just partner with Nintendo and make a CD attachment to the super Nintendo. Relations fell apart. A lot of people historically they blame Nintendo for kind of boggling that, but the bottomline is-- -The media is much cheaper for groups. One think ss produced cartridges with [unk] side. One think is just [unk] -And thus, it was expensive to develop to get those things to test them out to me where you're making your return, you know, I mean, that's the whole problem. - You and me. Booyah, grandma. Booyah! -The thing that Sony really did that was different is they added to-- that they brought in marketing that first generation of the Playstation. -\"Hey plumber boy, mustache man. Your worst nightmare has arrived!\" -But it was this idea that you should be moving on from whatever kiddie games you played before. There were times when I'm, you know, in high school and I'm like, \"I don't know how much longer I'm gonna be in this hobby.\" This is cool and this is fun and this is distraction, you know, but I want something more and I didn't know-- I didn't know what that was. I didn't know what to say. And then one day, you know, me and a friend went off. We rented some games with this Playstation I just gotten and one of them was Metal Gear Solid and I played Metal Gear Solid and for the second time in my life, video games changed my life. -Colonel, what's a Russian gunship doing here? -And one of them is on his knees. His name is Otacon. He's crying over sniper wolf and she's staring up the sky dying. -Set me free. -And hearing up with my other high school friend right next to me and you get attach to these characters, that's when you get an experience you can't get anywhere else and the scene, the taste that had it out was Metal Gear and it was like just that moment of like this is it man like this is-- -The future. -We have the second Dreamcast that was the last of Sega's Consoles unfortunately. -Sega should have been in a Dogfight with Nintendo of third generation of the generation. They begin to fade away. -The dream cast was so far ahead of its time. Nobody knew it to make it. -And then you had companies like the [unk] that basically just said we're a juggernaut and we are pulling support from your console and, you know, eventually, the right down on the Sega Saturn for Sega out of the hardboard business and they became a software publisher which is essentially what we have now. -I owe you nothing. -PlayStation 2. You're gonna see that even as today is the most sold video game console. -And Sony flips the switch, man. They changed the game with the Playstation 2 and it was also-- it was a bit of Trojan horse effect and that it was right around the time when DVDs were becoming the most popular medium of home video. -It's movie on a disc, the size of a CD. -The same way it back in the old days Nintendo kinda had every game we needed to play with maybe one or two exceptions. PS2 is the system for sixth generation. -Your torment is just beginning. -When you talk about-- Okay, Playstation 2s were God of War shows of. Then, Metal Gear continues to evolve, right? Again, all the games I've just mentioned are exclusive to the Playstation 2. Sony is swinging like Mike Tyson against your grandmother. -Do you have a problem? Turn off your spaceship. -And again, there are the young kids on the block and then I mean D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu comes a knock-in and here Microsoft suddenly announces they're gonna make-they're gonna make this Xbox. The Xbox was not a great console. It was a good first step. -Microsoft comes out. They know they're gonna take a loss at the Xbox. They talk a horrendous loss and not making money on it. But Microsoft is so in the black here that they can just say, okay, will do. -Microsoft is the Windows company. It is weird enough when Sony, the people who made your television, are gonna make you a game console, but at least they made a thing. -And they give you this gigantic black box and this gigantic controller and you're like, what the hell is this? This thing is a bomb. Nobody wants Halo. That was it for them. That's all they needed, what was Halo. -This is gonna be your lucky day. -There's the Halo obviously. There's Fable. You're talking about Knights of the Old Republic. Like they're saying we're gonna get you good games and then we'll put on them yellow text only on Xbox. -Yeah! -Hello? -The Nintendo comes out and they said, all right, you guys love N64 so much. Let's give you the Nintendo GameCube. -If you remember a lot of people laugh at the GameCube. So, there's a purple lunch box with a handle on. I appreciate that because I thought, you know, game consoles previously were meant to be tucked away hidden-- -But the Nintendo found a software in odd position in the beginning of the sixth generation because of a lot of gamers they want the Nintendo to fight back. They feel like Nintendo had taken its lumps from Sony, from Sega. -[unk] -And again, they had lost before they began on-- Remember, we only have this small group of franchises that we really love. I'm sure other people can program for it. -They did not. No one decided to come the game plan. -A lot of that focus had gone on to the Playstation 2. That real is where the industry had shifted over to. But this was the beginning of a change where it wasn't so much just about how good are your graphics or how good are your games, but what else can your console do. -[unk] This was the biggest Trojan horse I think anyone ever pulled off."

        "transcript": "[Music] what's up guys Zas here and welcome to the raid tutorial this is the first tutorial I've done for Black Ops 2 and I will be going over this with the help of my girl Bella Donna and we got a lot of really cool things to show you guys we've really tried to mix it up this time not just th show nothing but like uh Tomahawk spots and stuff like that we try to mix it up as much as possible get a nice variety in there so hopefully you guys enjoy so let's go ahead and kick this thing off first thing is the uh First Blood Tomahawk spot to a you're going to come up here to the center of the First wall or the beam whatever you want to call it Center yourself up and you're going to want to go dead center of this three-finger crack bring down your Crosshair till you're about just showing the top of your reticle on the top of the cement that's a really tough one to hit but there is also a lot of guys that come through there uh that tree was a big pain in the ass Force because it's not transparent your Tomahawk will get stuck so you got to be careful and get it high enough so here is the first blood from the other direction aide to C you're going to come up in front of the flag almost to the corner there you're going to line yourself up with C flag as far as left and right and uh this bottom Cloud here the bottom right Cloud that's all by itself and that's just straight up and that's going to land right next to C flag depending on your left right how close you get it but uh really uh really nice First Blood throwing a knife or I keep saying throwing a knife it's a tomahawk gz um Sim Tech spots thought was really important to include this this is a really high traffic area you got a nice rock here anytime you're in a a firefight here you can either use this rock for a head glitch or you can prone out and just clear the Top of the Rock and that will actually land inside the window and what's really cool is if you go on the reverse side you can also hit the other window the exact same way so there's a hard point here you got B flag so it's a high traffic area nice to know a lot of times you'll come around this corner there'll be somebody camping in the window same thing you can just drop down check your sim Tex just clear the wall and that'll land right inside the window so as long as they don't have flag jacket you can take them out moving on to shot spots and just random things that uh we found uh like I said this Center area here is is very very active so you can use that for head glitch you got the van you can use for a head glitch uh you can jump up here to this uh Center area and you can cover B flag or any of the stairs Windows um you can also cover this ramp here on the right over top of the van or you can jump to this white post and look over top of the van and you can see anybody coming up that right side so nice little shot spots there you can also jump up here if you want to get back in the window through this direction or cover this area of people coming up uh there's a lot of cars back here in the garage and you can use those to cover the backside over here by C flag um and also there's some hard points back in this area too so really nice uh back in this building you can get on top of the van but inside this building here you have a headquarter spot so there's a nice place to cover that area just in case you need a new spot to to kind of watch the headquarters again here with the cars uh you can go out this backside a lot of people don't know about this but uh you can bust this glass or climb over it go upstairs or take this roundabout if you're down below and uh let's say there's the headquarters right in front of you here you can actually jump up one or two ways here on top of this ledge get up on top of this and get access to the building so if they're watching that bottom area you can just swing right around and shoot them in the back if they're watching that main doorway so nice little alternate entrance there this one here is uh just a really dark spot so if you're trying to play surge conservative whatever high traffic area it's really dark really hard to see us so we thought we'd include that in there uh here this is a nice little uh shot spot you could use for Montage or something like that just a jump no scope maybe pull 360 shoot back to the basketball courts be a really cool uh final kill cam or something like that as well um if you come over to the basketball area up here on top of this platform you can actually jump and see over to that window I was just taking the alternate entrance into which is really nice little uh you pull like a no scope for a monetizer something uh this little island here is a nice spot to cover anytime you're playing Dom or headquarters or hard point this rock you can shoot into the little building there which is nice little Montage spot and then right around the corner you have kind of almost the same thing but reversed so you can shoot back over towards a flag and then you have this little bench right here where you can actually see pretty clearly over to B flag with a sweet little jump shot anything inside this building if you shoot in or out is a two shot unless you have FMJ or you get a head shot uh especially with even the DSR it's still a two shot um the last couple things we want to show is this jump shot here over top of the wall really nice you can use that in all game modes make for a really nice Montage clip possibly a triple too this here uh I have her standing on the other side of this wall and a lot of you guys know this when you spawn a aide you can come around the corner and this is your first blood and you just wall bang uh that wall is just paper is all it is this side it's a two shot the other side is one shot even with the XPR it's a one shot body shot so moving on to the search destroy challenge is what I'm going to call it now for Black Ops 2 uh you're going to be planting over here right here where I'm at and I know that there's no no kill cams so if you want to submit a video for this um you don't have to have the kill cam you can just uh record the full game if you can go back into theater and like follow the object it' be really nice but anyway what you're going to do is going to come down here in this corner Crouch down next to the fan you're going to pull out your Noob Tube this is a Noob Tube Challenge and you're going to go in this the center of this IE beam and then pull it just down left just a little bit so it's Center window pane on the ibeam down and left just a little bit and it's just a nice sweet little bank shot to take them off the bomb this is going to be the challenge for the map raid so if you guys whoever's the first person to hit this make sure you send me a link via YouTube um to a link with your video so I can send the first person to hit it 1, 1600 Microsoft points don't forget if you guys are going to submit a video that you have to submit the full round not the full game but it does have to be the full round of Search and Destroy that you hit the challenges and it's about it I'm out deuces [Music]"

um but let's get right into news and stuff because last time I ran out of time so Comer to their week War doog the awesome uh this guy's posting like crazy especially uh supporting the new Minecraft series and that's really important mainly because when you have a gaming channel and it's not huge you know you're not scen anners or somebody it's really hard to start a new game because it's hard to get support for it from your current subscribers um and that's understandable not everybody likes you know Minecraft if they play tanks because it's such a different game so it's it's understandable it's just nice to get that support he's got this new thing where he says hell yeah on every Minecraft video and it's kind of cool I really like that so I just wanted to say thanks so next up not streaming tonight sorry there's too much crap to do this weekend I'm going to a uh to a show I'm going to see Wicked this weekend with my wife it's supposed to be pretty good um also you know I'm just doing tons of other stuff I got the server up finally well I'll talk about that in a minute but I got tons of Minecraft stuff to do and um probably I need to play some tanks I don't know it's just going to be really really busy so sorry not streaming tonight I'll probably stream next week though uh sub video oh I already did that one oh no uh subscriber sent me a video it's his him playing Watt

doing a paper so he can't do it and um I'm doing Minecraft stuff that's that should be slowing down so should be able to get that video out again hopefully before we have 3,500 Subs um Minecraft progress there's been a big change and I wanted to show it to you tonight but that didn't pan out um so you're going to have to wait till Tuesday to see it but the progress is I got a dedicated host

add different machine blocks uh a lot more automation Redstone stuff oh red uh red power is going to be one of the mods um so it's going to be a drastically different server I was going to go to

forums that's just kind of a hold over if you guys want to chat about Watt and and uh try to get some platoon going there uh maybe if you want to request some sub fors for what I wasn't sure what you

adding people they can talk there uh Noob Center obviously it's not going to be done because there's a new server so it's pretty blank server projects that that's something I want to I want to do on the server um where we can all get together as a server and build on certain nights or something um any all Jag pan Jag Thunder one um talk to him a little more you'll see more of him coming on he's on the server now so that's good that's going to help us get some uh brand new some people in there soon that's all Minecraft stuff so cute uh after the Minecraft stuff's more set up I I'll start doing the W Clan stuff that's what I want to do next after that Q&A we we need to get into this this game's G be over soon Q&A you were a PJ do they still oh this is from c412 412 do they still call the Air Force Special Forces PJs yeah they do they're called uh I think they were called par jumpers or something like that PJs they call them um he'd be interested in more relaxed fun clan yeah that sounds like that sounds good for me too burn out of the game for a while yeah and that's the thing with adding more stuff to the Channels cuz you get I get kind of burned out on one game if I play it all the time I've been playing watt for almost 2 years and so that's a long time for me for one game and not be totally bored of it so I like to take breaks so you'll see my watt kind of comes and goes as far as how pumped I am about it U congrats on the partnership we'll have to play some more BF3 yeah that was a lot of fun we'll definitely have to do that again once more of the projects calm down I'll I'll start trying to play with uh subs and one and stuff so another question oh you know what let's skip that for next time BF3 BF3 two times XP this weekend on the PC only the May 26th and 27th um that's going to be pretty sweet so log in during those days to get double XP I wonder if that counts for kills as far as unlocks probably doesn't Minecraft there's a new snapshot up this week that has a lot of new stuff in it Ender Chest which is kind of cool you have to read about it I'm going to put a link up uh emeralds going to be a new or type um trade with villagers now is going to be in and a new pyramid um object in the desert that's going to be kind of cool there's a lot of other stuff too check the link in the video description World of Tanks I know that's what you're all waiting for boom you're dead roll the tanks this weekend special is really horrible which sucks for a Memorial Day weekend here in the US it's a 3-day weekend you'd think it'd be something good Line special all the tanks from 12 ton up to the 1390 or half off so buy them this week grind out that French line this week if you're doing it this weekend I mean uh there's no B uh XP bonus though so that sucks 30% off camo I'll be taking advantage of that since I did get the is4 I want to get camo on it I like to get camo on my on my top tier tanks uh 58% off gold rounds and that's pretty much it and that's all that's it for the news and everything and I hope you guys like this the video footage I got here this this game is pretty good I love this little tank 1,200 XP look at the credits this thing gets more credits than a low I think it's because it does more damage this thing does 400 damage for shot um appears aren't that bad for how damaged I am so obviously didn't get any medals uh Dam destroyed one guy damage four guys and detected two guys so pretty good game seven out of nine shots uh hit that's pretty good for this thing it is not very accurate but it's definitely a good brawler this is my favorite tank to buy off the U market right now the ti 59 is also a good tank to buy if you get a chance to buy it right now I'm not sure if it's available it probably isn't but anyway uh great game and please stay tuned for fan Fridays for next week also I'm going to need more Q&A so post some questions and I'll try to answer them from Q&A next week and I'll see you guys next week later for"

        "transcript": "all right what's going on folks it's K Spade the prospect before we get into this crew video I got a little bit of news for you guys a lot of people been asking about free agents would the M men Target this person or that person well we went after Neil Bridges you know we wanted the athletic small forward that could be a beast on the boards could score and do a little bit of everything and unfortunately Neil Bridges had to decline our offer I know how you guys probably feel about that and just when we thought our Hope was lost uh we found out that Neil Bridges has a cousin a lot of people say he's just as good as Neil Bridges kind of a knucklehead though never was really into school and uh worried on the streets is he really went past the drug test but lucky for him and lucky for us the ma men don't give drug tests so I'm going to show you guys how his audition went with us check this [Music] out [Music] heyy hey heyy what's going on folks it's K Spade the prospect of the midman crew and I'm back today with another NBA 2K15 crew mode video folks after showing you guys our first ever crew game this year last night I'm back tonight to show you guys our first ever crew game with our new teammate Dre hendr so I kind of troll you guys in the intro saying that we could get Neil Bridges you guys know dread is kind of like the evil Neil Bridges I don't want to say e but Neil is the good guy dread he a g he a goon ain't no tell him what he'll do so if you guys remember the first video we was really carried by the Beast the Beast saved us in that game I played horribly I really honestly I really almost shot my team out of the game in that first game but I was saved by our easy button and I'm out here tonight without our easy button but I want you guys to be like oh no he got to be out of his mind you guys know me and Q have pretty good chem istry that's my little bro so you know we going to come out here and make it do what it do starting the game off you can already see that chemistry working the crazy thing was adding him to the mix made this team run at times we look like the Heat and I'm not talking the heat without LeBron I'm talking the heatles you know what I'm saying big three with d way having good knees that Heat team so let's get into it you guys will see exactly what I'm talking about it's a 10 six game right here your boy got some pretty decent defense however right here I kind of got shook up didn't matter though the guy couldn't make the shot all that dribble stuff don't matter if you don't get a shot and the ball movement is beautiful right here that one ends in the hands of LeBron James who finishes and that's crazy because I told you guys my my player kind of he's built after a slightly more athletic realy allity but both Neil Bridges and Dre hendr they are both built on the LeBron James type of build his whole game so like it's almost like having two LeBron's out here I mean it's crazy look at this here you see me trying to find some space when I do I pass it off man the ball never touch the ground right there beautiful ball movement leads to another basket for the maidman crew we cooking here Dre gets dirt in the paint kicks it out to me I'm Dion Waiters I go back in we're going to pass it all the way around to the homie leis shout out to lais I ain't even mention him so far this video my bad bro he going to get the three with something scrub do like a 67 overall lais still made it rain with him second quarter action right here they not guarding lais again the scrub can shoot threes y'all he can shoot him larz gets another three to go 247 right here everything is looking like it's going to be a walk away game but you guys already know this game is always a game of runs and it's about sustaining it beautiful pass from me man did I mention we had some great floor running and some great ball movement cuz if if I didn't I want to insert that here great defense was another thing we had these guys aren't missing all these shots because they're bad players our defense is making them miss these shots and the oop goes up right there Dre Hendricks catching it throwing it down hard let's go that's what you can expect when we got this guy on the floor we almost a completely different team when we got the beast on the floor we play a real slow tempo you know halfcourt set when we got dread out here we run you dig we run a double digit lead right here dread on some great defense you saw he was shooting 100% right there he tips the pass get the steal that's La Paris out on the break and young bangout is going to finish that one with a dunk and here at the end of the second quarter I'm calling for it I got a perfect look and I just can't get the three to go so so far through one and a half crew games I'm still struggling to find my perimeter shot which is crazy that's what I do quick look at the halftime top performance of course you see QJB and Dre Hendrick up there doing that thing I think he was still shooting 100% look at this right here though how did I miss that I don't know but I've always said if you give me two looks in the same possession the same set I never miss two in the second one you see I get that one to go not a moment too soon cuz at some point I was thinking wait a minute what's going on with me my opponent getting crazy on the shot taking two ill advised shots missing them both and you going to see his numbers right here five or 13 he's kind of looking like me in our first game so that tells me he's probably a shooter he's probably really their their shooter he's just having an off day and the bad thing about being a shooter when you have a off day you want to shoot yourself out of the slump that's what we kind of been taught to do so I I kind of feel for the guy he remind me of me in the first game except he don't have a beast to kind of carry him all right so look at this third quarter man look at the beautiful ball movement again we going to get it download the who can't finish that one and they're off on the break so we started to shoot a t look at that beautiful hesy and that ain't even the uh automatic hesi that's like a manual he hesitated I stopped he blew by me nice play look at me I'm Mike Miller making it do what it do but anyway like I was saying we came out here and in the second half we slowed down I I realized that watching the video making these videos gives me a slightly uh I don't want to say it's an unfair Advantage because I'm still doing some work here but I get a chance to kind of steud film and see what we did wrong and we slowed down in the second half and I think that kind of allowed them to catch up some ground so they got back in the game we tried to pull back away it was like a tug of- War but at some point it really looked like we was going to run away with this game that's a turnover right there we didn't need you see these guys on the break he's going to finish with the nice little dunk right there we right around a minute Mark so all we got to do is not have crazy turnovers like that one right there and we can get out of here here with the win I'm always kind of nervous at this point in the game because I have witnessed some crazy comebacks in crew games and I don't want to be on the wrong end of one look at LeBron right here okay then King James okay LeBron ain't passing so folks it was a great game that's how you welcome a new teammate so you guys hit Q up on Twitter and tell them uh you know welcome to the made men officially so that's all I got for this one folks wait a minute why in the hell was this guy to play of the game let me hurry up and cut that off all right folks that's all I got for this one catch you guys on the next one I'm out peace [Music] hey hey [Music] heyy"

        "transcript": "- WE WANT TO EVALUATE\nTHE TWO GIVEN LOGARITHMS WITHOUT THE USE OF A CALCULATOR. WE HAVE LOG BASE 3 OF 81\nAND LOG BASE 2 OF 32. TO EVALUATE THESE WE'RE GOING\nTO SET THEM EQUAL TO A VARIABLE, LET'S SAY X, THEN WE'LL WRITE THIS\nAS AN EXPONENTIAL EQUATION TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF X. SO TO WRITE THIS LOG EQUATION\nAS AN EXPONENTIAL EQUATION WE CAN USE OUR NOTES BELOW\nWHERE B IS THE BASE, \"A\" IS THE EXPONENT,\nAND N IS THE NUMBER. ANOTHER NICE WAY TO REMEMBER\nTHIS IS TO START WITH THE BASE, WORK AROUND THE EQUAL SIGN TO\nFORM THE EXPONENTIAL EQUATION. SO HERE WE HAVE 3 RAISED TO\nTHE POWER OF X MUST EQUAL 81. SO 3 TO THE POWER OF X\nMUST EQUAL 81 AND NOW WE'LL SOLVE FOR X. WE CAN DO THIS\nWITHOUT THE USE OF A CALCULATOR BECAUSE WE CAN WRITE 81\nAS 3 RAISED TO A POWER. 81 = 9 x 9 AND 9 = 3 x 3,\nSO 81 = 3 TO THE 4th. SO NOW WE HAVE 3 TO THE X\n= 3 TO THE 4th. SO THESE TWO ARE EQUAL\nAND THE BASES ARE THE SAME, AND THEREFORE THE EXPONENTS\nMUST BE EQUAL MEANING X MUST EQUAL 4. WELL IF X = 4\nTHEN LOG BASE 3 OF 81 MUST = 4. LET'S TAKE A LOOK\nAT A SECOND EXAMPLE. WE'LL SET THIS EQUAL\nTO A VARIABLE LET'S SAY Y. WRITE THIS AS AN EXPONENTIAL\nEQUATION. SO 2 IS THE BASE, Y IS THE\nEXPONENT AND THE NUMBER IS 32. SO 2 TO THE POWER OF Y\nMUST EQUAL 32. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT 32. 32 IS EQUAL TO 2 x 16,\n16 IS EQUAL TO 4 x 4, 4 IS EQUAL 2 x 2. SO WE HAVE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 FACTORS\nOF 2 SO 32 IS 2 TO THE 5th. SO 2 TO THE POWER OF Y\nEQUALS 2 TO THE 5th. AND AGAIN, THESE ARE EQUAL.\nTHE BASES ARE THE SAME. SO THE EXPONENTS MUST BE EQUAL\nAND THEREFORE Y IS = TO 5. WHICH MEANS OUR LOGARITHM\nIS = TO 5. SO WE HAVE LOG BASE 2 OF 32 = 5. NEXT, WE'LL TAKE A LOOK\nAT TWO EXAMPLES WHEN THE NUMBER PART\nOF THE LOGARITHM IS A FRACTION."

The first thing is to show clearly that you are\nflooding the mask slowly. It is very important especially when you plan to go with your students to the cold open water. If you teach them from the beggining to flood the mask slowly, they will be better prepered for the cold water entering thier mask. The second key element occurs after you replace the mask.\nThis is clearing the mask by the nose. It is important to show clearly that you first\nstart to clear the mask with your nose and then bent your head backwards."

        "transcript": "foreign may i please introduce you all to the tremor scholars team hello the aim of this short film is to raise awareness of the sustainability issues which surround from our campus and how the campus itself affects the local environment i hope you all enjoy our film there are currently 1 600 students based at treme campus and this is expected to rise to 2150 by 2015. this substantial increase will have a massive effect on tremor campus itself and the surrounding community so the role of individuals in minimizing the impact is crucial we can get quite a lot of students in here but it's where they go after it's getting now that this year i think quite a lot of students have had trouble finding somewhere to live one of the problems of being a vibrant town is that housing becomes a premium and i think what we're finding now is a lot of the larger family houses are being converted to what we call hmos into houses multiple occupation due to the geography of falmouth there are certainly so many areas where people can live and the impact on housing in terms of from a student accommodation and the volume of people have come into the area in a very short time is a real impact to the town housing situation i don't know where my kids are going to go things like purpose-built student accommodation is the way to go there's already one in in the area and they're looking at other possibilities of the future and that will be a make a big difference moving on from that some of the other issues we've had is about the aesthetics of the thing if you like so if you go student household because you're only in there for a few months there are sometimes appearance issues it's sometimes it's simple things about putting curtains up or making sure the front garden is cut or the bins go on the right day the campers will recycle if you put things in the right in the place two years the students here at this campus have really really worked hard to recycle this campus was producing as a residence alone somewhere in the region of about between 200 and 300 bags of either recycled plastic and cardboard and it's on the increase now it's reaching nearly 500 bags per week all this stuff it goes back to cory's recycling depot at true all gets recycled within the uk recycling for example culturally i mean you can argue about you know whether it's effective in terms of dealing with environmental questions but it's actually very deeply embedded and culturally the way in which we think about our relationship to the environment only for the rub shell on the mornings of when the rubbish is collected if it goes out a few days beforehand one it's illegal for a star and secondly with the seagulls is where we are living you know if they're pulled to bits and straight away is that what looks looks negative to the town the more you do the better it is for the campers it's your campus your recycling use it and we can make it be great campus does have a positive impact on the local economy and its growth there are 28 bars and pubs alone in falmouth 15 taxi verbs which should probably not be able to sustain themselves if it wasn't for the students i think it's had a good effect i know they're not everyone thinks the same but i do i think you know they're bringing a lot of money to the economy in term time i mean we are like rams really really busy constant stream of people whereas when you know out term time we actually have to have our hours cut without the student population our busiest night would be dead so personally i find it really difficult when people speak about how the students are ruining this town when really i think without the students this town would still be a tiny little fishing village with hardly any wealth in their economy there's a lot of money flying from the university the students coming down from is probably during turn time can account for up to 10 15 of our business i think a lot of the businesses and family if you look walk down the high street um and there are businesses that are even struggling now if you took the students away completely i think you'd create a huge problem a lot of businesses would close down i think government has insulated somewhat from the problems that other cornish towns have got from economy point of view because of the student pound not just through employment not just through bringing the students here it's the whole infrastructure of the town will change with the university it is always important to be associated with universities and campuses and places that are the temples of the modern world and education plays a very important role in spreading the message of healthy sustainable and informed eating a lot of responsibility lies upon students shoulders because they can start a fantastic food group a good food tradition in the college and talk about it students can get involved with sort of ordering local veg boxes and there's a really good local producer um at kliscon um who you can just google search and they'll deliver boxes to campus and they're pretty reasonable as well which is a really good way to get local produce at a reasonable price stannery is really good at using local produce as much as they can because obviously they've got to deliver a service um but recently they've decided to only stock marine stewardship council approved fish which is brilliant and they also order a lot of their um fruits and vegetables from west coast the west country distributors i strongly believe in the future and i think that remote campus is surely and certainly and slowly becoming a hub an example of sustainability in the whole of the country"

        "transcript": "so Modern Warfare 3 has been out for what two 3 weeks now not really keeping count but uh in that time time period I think I've put in a day game time game play uh which some people might say is a lot but uh actually it's not that much compared to uh many other people that have been whoring this game relentlessly in a like third fourth fifth Prestige already probably more than that now but um I haven't really made many videos um well I say I haven't made many videos I've made an adequate amount in my opinion but uh compared to the amount of spam you're seeing in people's subboxes Modern Warfare 3 daily hourly minut secondly uh I haven't really made that much you know got to get them views got to get that YouTube money uh but yeah so I haven't really been enjoying the game which is the issue for me uh and there are various reasons for this which I will explain uh the first one is to do kill streaks now I could see before the game that there was going to be an issue uh one of the developers said in a video that um kill streaks were only available to the sort of better players and they wanted to change that so anyone could get them and I was a bit like hm that doesn't sound like a good idea that's not what kill streaks are for and as it's shown kill streaks are now no longer any sort of not that they were very prestigious anyway because they were so easy to get in previous games now they're even easier to get thanks to the support kill streak setup which is absolutely dire in my opinion the amount of times I've died from a self bom and it's the sort of players that can get these kill streaks they don't even have to get any kills now thanks to actually as they're called Point streaks because they could literally just walk around and capture Flags or doing nothing remotely useful and then getting a kill streak despite dying 30 times and that doesn't make any sense but the main issue with that is how how easy UAV is obtainable and they're Advanced UAV and even Counter UAV to block yours EMP as well to block your own to destroy your kill streak it's very they they have a massive impact on the game and these players aren't even any good so I don't I can't see any logic behind that at all and it's pretty annoying and then you just sort of have to look at the regular kill streaks anyway and just look at how easy a UAV is to get uh say you're playing domination and you've got Hardline on you walk over to a you catch it you need one more kill for your UAV and it's just it's far too easy to get that and there's so much kill streak spamming and there they're Relentless in some games so I didn't really like the kill streak spamming in Modern Warfare 2 and it's only become more prevalent in this game so that's pretty annoying for me though I really like the specialist uh killstreaks that I'm using here I just wish um perhaps there was some sort of Juggernaut perk you got with it once you've got all of them because you know you you work very hard to get all of your perks which is what it gives you and then you just die pretty much instantly which is pretty lame but whatever um so moving on from point streaks which I don't really like in the slightest um the next issue is maps and that is something that a lot of people have expressed they have an issue with um it's not so much the colors and stuff I mean this map is a bit dull and lifeless it's more to do with the size of the maps and the layouts of the maps so this map is uh probably one of the bigger ones actually but it's not actually very big um and that is the case with most of the maps they're all tiny and you know you can sort of Spawn walk a few inches and then you're in there spawn because well the spawns are crap but uh also because the maps are small um but that's uh the small Maps is not a killer I think what the Killer is for me is that there are so many tight Corners as you can sort of see back there I was in a room where there was several narrow passageways I could walk down and eventually lot lots of sort of blind Corners as well and eventually someone walks around the corner and knifes me as has happened several times in this game play and it's just uh there are so many different positions you can die from any one time time like here I believe there's uh uh the archway to my left this little room I'm going into now behind me there are two ways to the right there were several ways it's death sort of can come from anywhere and it sort of takes away a bit of skill to be honest because although you can up your sensitivity and players with higher sensitivity will be rewarded on this game you know there's only so many places you can watch at one time and considering there's you know four five six places a player can come from at any one time it's very difficult to sort of account for all of that um I think if the maps were sort of they they just need to be less tight there's no Open Spaces like you saw on Wasteland and derail um not that an open space is fantastic because if you run into an open space you're pretty much guaranteed to die but um there's just there's no Variety in the maps they're all quite plain and that's another thing as well there's no there's no Afghans there's no Quarry there's no map with any sort of height on it no levels no stories I mean this map has uh it has the sort of inside of the buildings but um anywhere that that sort of leads to any sort of height is usually uh closed off area that just leads to a camping window that you can sit in it's no it's not a feature part of the map I mean where I'm walking now you know there's no real action going on up here it's just kind of pointless in all honesty so maps are an issue in my opinion and many other people's opinion but the annoying thing about that is they're never going to change because obviously going to spam DLC out and try and make us buy that or buy Elite or whatever and generally DLC has been very very poor most of the maps only have to look at things like Carnival Salvage trailer park and just think oh dear I'm not buying that again but um yeah I don't think that's ever going to be fixed but the main killer for me is that this game has become rather stale boring repetitive uh I've been playing the series since Call of Duty 1 and ever since Call of Duty 4 nothing much has changed there's been minor changes but the way the game plays hasn't changed significant amounts and then Modern Warfare 2 compared to Modern Warfare 3 is literally like the same game so having played Modern Warfare 2 for roughly two years because I didn't like Black Ops much or play it much uh it's quite difficult to play this game and it's just it feels like there's no need for them to innovate anymore because they know they can get sales and what they've got they've got a working formula that's going to repeatedly out sell the game for it as Modern Warfare 3 has out sold Black Ops so you know you don't change what ain't broke so there's no real need for them to innovate and add huge amazing new features that people may not like and you know I can understand that but at the same time it's boring me and it's not hugely appealing to play so I can't say that I'm going to play a huge amount but uh we'll have to wait and see so this is the end of the game play not particularly good it's quite tough I find it quite tough to get low death game place but uh 30 and 7 is the best I managed to get and uh yeah that pretty much sums up that uh maybe there'll be more gameplay issues eventually but uh yeah that's what I think of it now so thanks for watching this has been X Dave and I'll see you next time"

The route you decide to go will depend on\nthe size of your collection and, obviously, your available space. But you don't have to have a big, fancy house\nin order to have a quality wine collection. You do not need a wine cellar or a room dedicated\nto wine storage. In fact a simple wood wine rack in the family\nroom stores your wine while displaying it for all to see. Many wine enthusiasts prefer to display their\nwine visibly so they can enjoy its beauty as well as its flavor. Fortunately, there are many sizes and styles\nof racks available for containing and displaying wine. You can find something to fit nearly any decor,\nfrom traditional to sleek and modern. Whether you choose a wood wine rack or a piece\nmade of metal or glass, the look can be quite enticing. The only feature necessary, no matter what\nstyle you choose, is that your rack allows for horizontal storage of the bottles. as this allows the cork to remain in contact\nwith the wine so that it does not dry out and allow air to seep into the bottle. Aside from horizontal storage, the features\nof your wine rack are limited only by your personal style. Considering a wide selection of wall wine\nracks before buying one means we are more likely to make the best choice. Find the perfect hanging wine rack for your\ncollection wherever you live, whether that's in Los Angeles, New York, or anywhere else."

        "transcript": "hey I'm Zack with bik ben.com here with galper and one of their super bike wave roers uh Sandro what can you tell me about this rotary well the one you're holding is a racing rotary it's the one that we're using for all our AMA Road racing teams uh it's the latest and the greatest the same exact design that we use for our Motocross Supercross thingss with the exact same card that's being the tsunami it's basically yet another trick design with lots of cuts lots of different you know ways of going about friction um this one is obviously like all the other rotors that we make 420 steamless steel you know it's a high-end rotor this one is fully floating like the rest really what does this offer to the writer well um Galer has different products depending on what kind of writing you're going to be doing with your rotors I mean if you're just going back and forth to your house and you're doing some Canyon riding or if you're out doing some track uh Motocross or Supercross you are going to be choosing a performance RoR in this case a gfer rotor wave design it's one of our primary things wave gives you better lever feel lots more performance in temperature reduction the wave design allows for gases to be removed from the brake P it also for offro purposes like on ATV applications it removes any mud or debris that might be sitting on the rotor surface so in general with a Galer wave rotor you get to have um a lot more performance that you would get out of your stock system it's really anyone looking for above and beyond what the stock rotor is going to offer for the bike correct yeah and as far as the manufacturing process uh what do you guys got going on there well all our rotors like I mentioned they're all 420 high carbon stainless steel it's a material that is unique to the Galer family you can't just go and buy it it's a material that has been developed over the last 14 years um it's all laser cut um meaning the rotor itself it's cut by laser it's no not stamped like a lot of other manufacturers the laser cutting allows us to be very precise and very clean to the cut there is no stress being put onto the rotor like stamping wood it also allows us to you know heat treat because as you're laser cutting you're also tempering the unit itself 420 stainless steel is a material that has lots of memory so if you stamp it it may actually remember the stamping brute force and may want to work rapidly so laser cutting is a great process so laser cutting basically prevents all that you end up with a high quality premium product at the end of the day laser cutting double dis grinding is another method in which we follow our manufacturing most of our competitors they'll grind one side tunder rotor and grind the other side it's inexpensive but yet again our rotor wasn't buil for the inexpensive Market it's a highend rotor and so we double dis grind all our units in a parallel grinding system it's a two diamond diamond resurfacing rod that they're grinding the rotor both left and right side at the same time so you end up with that that beautiful cut and also lots of good feel it's absolutely a premium rotor with uh you know premium performance what about the warranty it has six-month warranty um that's from the date of purchase but uh we always say the same thing I mean if you install the rotors and then you get deployed overseas um obviously we're going to listen to you when you come back a year and a half later if there's been a problem we can tell when a rotor has or has not been abused on its six month period or two years period um all our rotors are also warranted for racing so whether you're doing track days or you're doing Supercross Motocross any kind of racing the rotors are warranted and I believe we're one of the only brands that has that kind of aanty at this point anything else we should really know about these rots what about the install process how does that run well uh I would say the install it's very simple you just take the stock rotors out put the store rotors back put the golfer rotors back on um bolts uh new Loctite if necessary you know you got to follow the St the stock torque specification um the one that you're holding for example is a full floating unit that means that the outside and the inside blade float from each other it's something that a lot of consumers are very interested on so that's another Point full floating gives you a lot more F because the brake pad and the rotor track each other instead of solid units that you know the rotor would go One Direction and the P the other direction so it basically prevents warping any issues from developing there yeah warping excessive heat um it prevents any of those and also it gives you a lot better break lb feel you know yeah that's really great stuff and you guys are available basically all week for any technical issues anything that comes up yeah we have two individuals constantly on tech support um you guys on your website uh we have the videos on how to install them um so either whether they come to you or they come to us since we have a great relationship you know we will make sure that it gets taken care of without any doubts that's awesome information thanks for coming in today all right thank you so much"

        "transcript": "[Music] Super Smash Brothers most people know Super Smash BRS as the Nintendo crossover fighting series featuring everyone's favorite Nintendo mascots duking it out on the battlefield including the likes of Super Mario The Legend of Zelda Pokemon Donkey Kong and even some special cases like Sonic the Hedgehog but smash wasn't just about its all-star cast even before the game's implementation of Nintendo characters Super Smash Brothers sought out to completely shake up the world of traditional fighting games the developer sat down took an entire genre and thought outside the box and ask themselves how can we make Super Smash Brothers different and it all starts with the objective historically the majority of fighting games fall under the same category in mindset typically you have two characters placed into a box shaped Arena locked into looking at each other trying to whittle each other's health bar down to zero through the use of spacing of of Combos and pokes that is your objective in contrast Super Smash Brothers is a fighting game that thinks outside the box quite literally in Smash Brothers the objective is changed and you now must try to knock your opponent off the stage this change makes Smash Brothers play out more as a king of the hill type game as opposed to the standard cage match mentality by changing the objective Super Smash BRS created an entirely new type of fighting game experience with a new metag game centered around knocking back opponents that that still manages to retain and build off of standard fighting game mechanics the first change the percentage system because the objective is to force your opponent off stage a combat system was made designed around knockback mechanics Super Smash Brothers for go the standard health bar mechanic completely and instead displays damage given to a player with a damage percentage counter you still have your standard and special attacks tilts and grab moves but they all function a little differently from other fighting games the more damage your opponent receives the greater knockback They will receive and the easier it becomes to knock them off stage the system can be described as a dynamic combat system because damage percent is always changing this means different Combos and offensive options change and function differently as a match is carried out for example a character like Melee Mar may be able to effectively juggle and combo Fox at lower percentages but the same options will not work when fox has already received significant damage meaning if he hasn't already converted into a KO Mar will have to use different options to get the kill the dynamic combo system also builds in other elements including the different character moves unique hit boxes stale hits and that's when a repetitive move becomes weaker in succession and the Very noteworthy fact that each character in Smash has their own individual weight value and fall speed that dictates how they are able to combo and be comboed by different characters at different percentages another mechanic known as di or directional influence also allows players to influence their character's trajectory when hit not only does this give an unprecedented amount of control to the player but it works hand inand with the dynamic percentage system as the amount you can di depends on how far and how fast your character is launched over a period of time with the knockback based combat system in place the rest of the game stages and characters were built to take advantage and give variety to these mechanics stages and smash were designed with four main different es from the standard box like stages of other fighting games stages were designed to be much larger than the characters they were designed to have Ledges that opponents could fall from they were designed with a variety of blast zones which are areas to the side and above in which an opponent becomes knocked out and they were designed with a variety of different platforms that characters could move on each of these different stage elements further build into smash's gameplay mechanics and distance it from other fighting games the size and shape of the stages have a significant impact on how players can defensively move around smash is a game where you aren't locked into looking at your opponent and you are given free movement utility of your character and when you work that together in conjunction with the characters and stages the game play evolves into something not really seen in other fighting games among the Smash series you see techniques such as Dash Dancing Fox trotting rolling Shield dropping through platforms and players trying to read and predict and react to these movement positions all made possible due to the stage layouts for example as a stage changes in shape and size different combo and offensive options become available to different characters maybe it's a fox using platforms to chase an opponent upwards or a Falon while jumping off of a stage to spike an opponent the fact that there is a ledge to each stage makes a Monumental difference in the way the game is played it's important to realize that smash is a game where you are knocking your opponent off stage in any direction to take away an opponent's life this means you don't always have to build up damage and KO someone off of the ceiling because it's possible to KO an opponent off the ledge of the stage at even low percentages through creative combat and strategy when an opponent is knocked off stage they will attempt to return back through the use of multiple jumps and sometimes even other attacks the aggressor can then try to intercept their opponent's recovery and deny them from getting back to the stage often times by the use of aerial attacks off stage while freef falling unlike other fighting games where a health bar will always require the same amount of damage to deplete Smash Brothers can see stocks End early or at any given percentage or time due to the way the game greatly rewards creative play and calculated risks when you take everything into consideration all the different elements in place in a standard Smash Brothers match it is without a doubt a very different and unique kind of fighting game whether it's melee brawl 64 or Smash 4 Super Smash Brothers offers new game mechanics and ways to play that are unique to itself as a series they took the traditional fighting game formula and looked at it from a different perspective with confidence to to create something new and that is what makes Super Smash Brothers so different there is an incredible amount of variety and possibility that isn't even really seen in other fighting games pro players took advantage of this fact and created a whole system of picking and counterpicking stages for competitive play it's also worth noting that due to the larger stages and Camera range Smash Brothers cements itself as one of the most competitive fighting game series for teams and doubles matches as well and when you consider all the vast possibilities already offered in singles play it's not hard to understand why smash teams add an entirely new Dynamic to an already unique game hope you enjoyed our brief look at Why Super Smash Brothers is different there's still a lot left to cover so make

        "transcript": "this is lowski with Captain Lewis now Captain Lewis I got to say being out here from day one being maed being batoned having a horse step on me by the police I was giving up hope that that the police are are one of us that they're our brothers and sisters that's always been in my thoughts but seeing you here gives me hope for that idea what gives you hope to be out here with us here today you guys give me hope the fact that so many of you were willing to live in the cold and live on this hard concrete and marble and not have the proper food food or uh bath facilities and whatnot and day after day after day I this is remarkable I I I you inspired me to come down mhm now what I've always been saying is that the police are not the enemy the police are could be our brothers could be our sisters could be our aunts our cousins we're all family we're all one on this world but how do you think we could reach out to more police officers I mean what Ma what changed you what made you as a as a as a former police officer as a former police captain uh understand the problem and be out here in support and how can we as an organization as a movement uh get more police officers on our side cor I understand the tremendous frustration everybody has and that's got to be vented and it's vented against those people who are trying to stop you from your demonstrations and protests and you can't hold it in because you're so pen up with the anger at the system and nobody listening to you and and we voted for Obama and he was a great I mean I actually cried when he was inaugurator cuz I never thought I'd see the day and I thought wow what in new America and he has been the biggest phony yeah and he's let everybody down and I'm even disappointed in his wife I thought she would have some influence if he started to go this way but she hasn't so that frustrates the hell out of me and uh so the so anyway I understand the reason for protesters to have to vent but I really don't think it helps the cause okay if you're there's no I don't see it helping the cause to win over the police by shouting at them calling their mother's names CU we we can't make enemies of them all right they're the ones that we have we have to win over CU they are us and they got to realize they are us when I started in a police force 1981 we had lifetime healthc care when I left they were giving three years health care I just heard recently I believe they're now negotiating the city wants to give them one year well guess what's next okay and it goes down and down and down and the pensions when I joined I got a really good pension newcomers Now new recruits they had that pension slashed in half and this is all because the tax base of the cities is dwindling and why is the tax base dwindling because jobs the manufacturing jobs all the jobs are being shipped overseas by the billion the millionaires who want to make become billionaires so they become the greed is so corrupt I mean if you're a millionaire you have gold forets you have a goldplated toilet seat isn't I mean how much more do you need yeah and well and then when you're in that position you know what you're they're doing they're trying they give money to politicians to veto any raise in the minimum pay yep and it's it's just so obvious that these are soulless people and soulless people should not be in power and corrupting our government yeah back to your previous Point anger creates more anger hatred only creates more anger and it's a cycle that continues and I've been you know I've personally been speaking out against the cycle and continue it's just been hard going through some of the abuses seeing the atrocity seeing the beatings it's a very very it's one of the strongest things I have I have to overcome uh in my life seeing that and still believing in it but you make me believe that and uh back on your previous point with uh the money and and system there's been a push here by some people to get money out of politics which means establish uh college sports rules where politicians would not be able to take any money from corporations or big Banks what was the Supreme Court ruling yeah that corporations versus us that was outrageous listen we even have the Supreme Court is even corrupt now that tells you how bad we are when the Supreme Court is corrupt something's got to change exactly what do you think of the of a of a basic idea saying that money uh private money corporations the big Bank should not be able to give any money to our elected officials do you think that's a good idea absolutely absolutely what the number one thing to win an election the number one thing is how much money do you have okay and when you get a lot of money from somebody you're indebted to them okay and if you don't follow what they want if you don't vote the way they want you to vote guess what next election you're out of a job okay so they are just puppets for corporate every Poli ician is just a puppet for corporate americ bought and sold my last question is you were recently arrested for standing with uh the protesters here how was that experience uh being in jail was that well I'm going to tell you the first experience I had yeah I've had a lot of proud moments in my life and I had a lot of proud moments in my career and this this might sound very strange but when they put those cuffs on me and was LE leading me across that intersection I felt the proudest I ever felt in my life Wow to join you guys in solidarity well you touched my heart you give me hope you guys touch me and you give me hope and once I think the police come around there'll be real significant change because it is US versus that small very exclusive Elite and I thank you from the bottom of my heart Captain Lewis you're awesome God bless you brother you and I wish you the best everything and just try to realize that I know you have a lot of anger but when you shout these things at the police and if hey civil disobedience is okay but but don't go kicking them and don't go spitting on them just you know let get up with them and go with them uh willingly don't continue the cycle of hate and anger end it you hit it right you hit it right on the head you're continuing the cycle you're right don't continue it all right thanks for what you're doing problem I'll tell you right now what everybody's doing here is the most important thing because you guys are the real media thank goodness for the internet all right but then I don't doubt someday they're going to try to shut that down Corporate America will shut down the internet when they see this getting stronger and stronger I have not watched any television news stations I have not watched any I have not read the papers I get all my news from the internet the websites like yours and there's a million of them"

think I saw that in the last one too anyway this is just a combination of things drugstore Sephora I actually still have stuff here from uh when Sephora had their friends and family like last year like 2012 yeah um so I'll just start with that um I ended up getting the favorites show me me some lip it is just a sampler of some of the more popular lip colors tarte Hour Glass Laura Mercier something that I'll put in The annotation fresh sugar and um who's that that is oh it's just Sephora it's Sephora's own brand um of lip gloss so for 25 bucks I thought that was a really really good deal a good way to uh test out a bunch of them and I like me some lip things that I picked up from that sale one is the sample size not sample I'm sorry travel size of The Hourglass mineral Veil this is a primer this is this is not just a primer this is the primer this is what I will be using full-time permanent forever once I'm through all the other stuff I just I I it it is the most amazing balance and perfectness of smooth and powdery and moist and maybe silicone I I don't even know I might be making it up my point is it's just that perfectly balanced primer and I I mad I have not I'm not mad not really mad but I I I wish I would have found it earlier in my life and I haven't but uh I have it now I'll have it forever it's amazing go try it and it's expensive holy cow this is expensive I think just for this loan was like $18 for this little itty bitty how many how many ounces is this thing this is um this is a third of an ounce 33 it's a third of an out it's for like 18 bucks I think the big one is like 50 something I don't even know but it's worth it and it'll last a long time last thing from Sephora is an ey Shadow uh I think they had it in clearance and it is called prism chroma prism hold up prism Prisma Chrome and it is Dazzle number 18 oh I I feel as if it is good for blue eyes I don't even want to touch it I didn't even touch it that was like the way it came all fancy it lookss like someone touched it but I'll Swatch it oh oh yeah I like it I kind of wish I would have gotten another one now cuz I think they were I don't know maybe $3 $6 I don't know I don't know uh that's it from Sephora I picked up uh the rest of the as drugstore um this Foundation the Revlon Color Stay whipped wow um I'll use it more in the spring and summer but they had I think Walgreens had buy one get one free no buy one get one half off and had some good coupons I picked up two of them uh I picked it up in the colors buff and sand beige um I feel like buff was just a smidge light on me and this would be too dark I'll probably mix them and I I don't have a problem doing that that doesn't bother me but I did do a review on this is in the past and I'll link that below if you're curious to know more about it um I like it I got one thing from Urban Decay and I got the box but the bottles in the bedroom uh this is their all nighter long lasting makeup setting spray and this is another one of those I would have never ever ever gotten this even after seeing videos on it unless I tried it and when us gals went to Chicago last year Shanny bny had this and we were going out one night and I tried it wow I I put this on after my makeup clearly and of course we went to a few places that had adult beverages and then you know a few other places but you know 4 or 5:00 in the morning after all of that my makeup looked exactly the way it did when I put on when I put it on and this was the only thing I had done differently cuz normally it would have looked horri it wouldn't have looked horrible but normally it would have been worn down a little bit and not as I mean it just looked completely Fresh So this stuff is this stuff wow I I hope that I get the same results um you know all day long with it uh this guy here should have been in with the elf hul but um it's just another well I I have I have one so I say another angled eyeliner brush and um I have the Sonia kashuk uh angled eyeliner brush and I have the sigma eyeliner brush I don't know the number I'm not good with the numbers I'm I'm not I'll put the number of it uh on the screen here but um and I like all three of them but this tends to be my favorite because it's like the tiniest teeniest thinnest and I really like to go in very fine Strokes so that I can build up rather than try and correct um I like them all for different occasions I guess but I find myself using this one the most and it's actually the cheapest so I just picked up an extra one have Covergirl and Olay their concealer balm I already opened it um I generally do not like stick concealers um because they tend to be more dry but it said balm and it said Olay with it so I maybe think that it won't be as drying and I do have a concealer video in the make in the works um got a great response about that thank you so much for letting me know the majority of people are like yes concealer video and uh being the concealer junkie I am I absolutely have that working right now um but that's going to be onep last things uh Essie I picked up very cranberry and uh it's just a cranberry ises color and I I tend to migrate towards this type of a color a lot oh look at that on my nails I know it's not like exactly but it's just in that family I just feel like that looks the best on my nails versus other stuff that doesn't another mascara shock and a this one is the Colossal cat eyes don't really know anything about it I tend to pick up any new mascara that Maybelline puts out because I love the falsy um the original falsy volume Express so very much that um why do I keep looking for anything else and I like the Jordana too still loving the Jordana but uh last two things IE Studio maybeline eye Studio quads this one is copper Chic or is it copper chick copper Chic I don't know yeah I do chick has a K on the end of it wow copper Chic I felt as if this is another thing that would be good with blue eyes and then this other one is give me gold so uh Curious to try those too I have been playing with the Cozy cashmere that I got a while back and I've enjoyed it I really like the texture and in the feel and um yeah so I will let me know if you're curious about any of these I'll probably let you know anyway and um I don't know I don't know how long it's going to be before another haul I don't know so uh cuz there's a lot of stuff here that hasn't been touched so thank you so much for taking the time to watch I appreciate it and uh I hope to see you on the next one all right guys thanks bye"

        "transcript": "hi everybody jacob here welcome back to my channel i have come back from the mosquito boutique yet again and a quick unboxing because the unboxing should be quick and exciting so uh we got our little sticker here the ribbon they're still using the old version ribbon which is from their 30th anniversary which is right before jeremy scott started doing moschino so 30 years anniversary of moschino and uh i am gonna undo the sticker so and we are gonna do undo the little ribbon done okay so basically let's make it quick and snappy i got the two headbands now a long story short i actually have a third one which i already got i ordered this online um because my mosquito boutique did not have them did not carry them in and i found like one last one online and they were sold out right away i wanted the pink one and the black one but i just got the black one uh because the last one left and then but i already kind of asked my mosquito boutique if they had these and they said they'll try to order them so then by the time i got this one i received the phone call for these so i got all three but i mean they're like 19 bucks or euro so that was that was okay um so look at that all right actually let me just put one on for you all to see how fun this can be okay granted it looks creepy on me right now because well just because just because i guess i have a big head and i don't really fit but yeah whatever let's just keep them on for the sake of opening these babies up they come in these plastic bags which are open on one side and they open them because they need to add because these are made in china so i mean you know they're 19 euro i suppose they cost 10 cents to make this is the barbie font it's it's gorgeous you know the mosquito barbie font then you get the mosquito couture uh tag and you get unfortunately with the new font not with the classic font jeremy you should have done it with a classic font but i guess mattel wanted you to use a new font for barbie so that was probably the deal they struck with mattel you know this has to be used as well as this for anybody who's interested in the pink model which is gorgeous this is the information number there you have also the price 19 euro and the black one which i am carrying on for you guys with my weird hairdo uh looks like this and this is its model number all right now another thing that i got uh well first of all let me just slide this one out for y'all to see gorgeous and gorgeous this is the inside of it this is moschino i face the producer um you take you can you know take this little piece off this is washable 30 degrees and it is made in oh come on i hate this stupid focus thing really are you really doing this to me camera you're not focusing fine made in china there you have it so it's you know really cheap but whatever um my only problem with these headbands to be perfectly honest with you guys i had this like for two days now this one so i was waiting for these because i got a phone call to make a proper review for the unboxing for you you see what happens to these like when you wear them they like kind of you know it's really cheap i mean you can like move this around and fix it and they're not broken by any means but it's it's cheap so the you know these babies are just for the sake just for the fun of it i guess so if you're gonna go for 19 euro mosquito that's what you get with you know you get these little holes and stuff but whatever that's what we do for for the love of it okay so um this is the the little bill thingy that they you know came with them they're totally sold out online i guess because they're also the cheapest thing and kind of a fun little gimmick but the other amazing thing which is really exciting to me

        "transcript": "[Music] hi everyone so I'm doing another haul um I'm supposed to be on a spending van but yesterday um I went to town um so yeah I'm going to do a haul basically if I'd have left this haul to like do another time then I would have found myself like buying more things and then yeah I'm going to try and not buy anything until my birthday now so I'm going to get all this stuff out of the way show you all and then I can put it away and then no more we can buy no more so I'm going to start with like make upy bits and these two I actually bought a while ago but I forgot to include them in my other haul and first I got a new mineralize skin finish um I can really tell the difference when I've used this and when I haven't um I ran out of this like a couple of weeks ago and I've only just bought a new one and I can really tell the difference like I know some people say that it doesn't really do a lot but I can tell the difference and this is \u00a3 2020 I was like what when I first bought this it was like \u00a318 and I was like that's expensive but I can deal with it but 20 I was like oh so yeah I got that and then I got a lipstick I got um that's chat box picked up the wrong one well I got cream cup anyway and yeah I picked up the wrong one oh well um yeah cuz when cuz like you'll see in my room tour that I store them in like little acrylic train now and it's so hard to find the right one I have to like pick them all up to find the one I want it drives me crazy so yeah perfect example I just picked up the wrong one so yeah um I'll start with Top Shop I've got some things in here actually I forgot them um so starting with Top Shop um I got the three for 8 Free socks cuz I usually get new look socks that have got like patterns on but I just wear them down so quickly so I bought these ones and I bought white like Whitey cream ones with black Frills I bought lilac ones with like creamy Ivory FRS and then I bought like light pasty blue ones with like creamy arvory FRS um then the rest will C up I only got one thing and it's this skirt and it's one of these like pum skirts I don't know if you're going to be able to see yeah the lighting's gone absolutely crazy what you can see and it's like a bodyc one and it's actually really slimy because of that panel at the front if you can see that and the peum bit kind of like hides on my last a bit so I really like this and this was only \u00a322 I was expecting it to be like a lot more um Top Shop have kind of put the prices down a little bit like before they would have charged loads for this and it's kind of like rir too like can you see that so yeah I really like that and it looks so nice I and it looks really like Slim in so yeah I got that um then from Primark that's in this bag too I got this black shirt and this is to go with the skirt cuz yeah and it's kind of like that and you can kind of see the back it's like a cutout back and in the summer that'll look really nice and then in the winter I can just put like a V underneath it and it's got like long sleeves and it's like that a little bit longer at the back and this looks so nice talked into that I'll maybe doing outfit of the day I don't know I don't know maybe so yeah I really like that and that was only1 which I thought was quite nice um what else I got also got this from Primark and it's like um a bikini top I don't know if I should show that I will um it's kind of like a I don't know is it an Al Tei print I don't know I like it anyway and it's got It's kind of just like a bra style one with like the straps and was \u00a388 which isn't that bad for saying but it's kind of more expensive than you usually pay a prim Mark I don't know I don't know um okay then from estey um they have them in my boots now and yeah um you can't be a YouTuber and not pick this up it's 's Min candy apple and you have to pick this up if you're a YouTuber you have to and then I also got Penny talk and I'm obsessed with rose gold at the minute and I hope heard someone talk about this and I had to have it I've got it on my nails now actually not going to be able to see and I can't remember to focus it properly but it looks really nice and maybe Instagram a picture or something um then from new lock they have a really good sale on it in there I bought this first that wasn't in the sale actually and it's this bikini well not it's not a bikini Jesus Christ it's like one of these that kind of go like that and then you've got your bom bit so it kind of just covers up your middle and then your back's kind of out so it's kind of quite sliming actually and it's got rose gold at the top and I was like oh yes you can't really see but it is and I really like this and this was $22.99 but there was 25% off it was before the sale but it was still like 25% off so I think it was like I don't know do the math you find out um so I got that and I'm really happy with that and I think I'm going to get another bikini this style and then from new look the other day I got these sandals I wanted them when they weren't in the sale okay I wanted them when they weren't in the sale but they were like 20 quid and I was determined to get some cheaper ones but then they went down to seven and that was okay cuz this year I've been getting like loads of Primark ones and they've even broken or they're not like wide enough cuz I've got really wide feet and these are in the wide fit section actually I don't you can see that but yeah I'm happy with these they've given me blisters cuz I actually wore them yesterday but um you know that's all part of it isn't it um the Sun comes out you get blisters so that's my haul I kind of kept it short well it was a bit small but um I think that's everything um so yeah if you have any requests for like video ideas then leave them down below because I'm kind of like really back into it now so yeah um that's everything and hopefully I won't be doing any more hauls anytime soon if I do then dislike it and don't unsubscribe but dislike it and tell me off so yeah that should be everything and I'll see you soon bye guys"

        "transcript": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's hard to believe here in the year 2013 the tremendous Renaissance that 2D Platformers are in the midst of at the turn of the Millennium every major franchise was shifting to 3D some with more success than others just when it seemed that handels would be the last Bastion for the genre several downloadable Indie titles injected A Renewed interest into this quintessential gaming staple classic franchises that made the jump the 3D reverted back to or release 2D offshoots perhaps the most obscure of these resuscitated franchises is the GI sisters originally released for the Commodore 64 1987 the great GI sisters was a Mario clone that didn't last long on stor shelves before Nintendo threaten legal action resulting in copies being pulled from store shelves in spite of not being in stores Long the great Gianna sisters developed enough of a cult following to raise $190,000 through Kickstarter to develop GI sisters Twisted dream true to most 2D platformer conventions the plot is quite simplistic the player controls Gian As She searches for her sister Maria who's been kidnapped in the dream world by a dragon this provides the simple impetus for ga's Journey Through the dream world shifting her Persona between a cute girly girl that inhabits a Halloween inspired iteration of the dream world and an edgy or Punk chick who traverses A variation of the dream world that is more colorful and cheery gi's personas also have different special abilities the cuty ga has a graceful twirl jump that allows her to glide through the air over extended distances while the punk GA can launch herself forward as a fireball swapping between these personas and mixing up moves to Traverse the environment is integral to surviving GI the Persona shifting and GI Twisted Sisters is similar to the time shifting mechanics in Sonic CD except that it can be performed on the Fly and you're in no way limited to how often or how many times you can shift Black Forest games does a commendable job making the most of this gameplay mechanic there are collectible crystals that litter the world with red Crystal that can only be collected by Punk Giana and yellow crystals obtainable only by cute girly GI collecting all these crystals earns better ratings upon completing levels the shifting mechanic also adds a puzzle element to the game figuring out which sisters Maneuvers will allow you to best proceed through an area is Central to the puzzle theme it's fastpac and never leaves you scratching your head for long but keeps you mentally engaged with the surroundings platforms will appear in one dimension that don't appear in another platforms move in certain directions with one Persona while while moving in another with the opposite Persona enemies change completely requiring one Persona to defeat the enemy while the other uses the defeated enemy as a traversal tool There is almost always something new in GI sisters while Gianna sister starts as a cakewalk the difficulty ramps up quickly as you're required to shift dozens of times to complete small stretches of levels some areas require you to cocoon yourself in bubble gum and Float through razor sharp crystals others require you to run through a gauntlet of obstacles while being chased by a wall of Fire by boxes can be pushed to create raised platforms and some levels have a more open design that requires GI to collect several keys in a determined order to open a passageway to a new area these challenges are remixed and recycled into devilish combinations late in the game frustration is mitigated by plentiful checkpoints and infinite Lives Many checkpoints are placed just after a difficult series of obstacles almost rendering the game Rage Quit proof visually Gianna sister's Twisted dreams is extremely appealing the backdrops are colorful and layered with detail the ju to position between the dimensions is natural and entirely seamless it is easy to spend time shifting between dimensions in some areas just to see how objects in one dimension are translated into the other dimension large hollowed out tree trunks in the Cheery Dimension become massive reptilian skulls Wells become rotted tree stumps owls become horn demons texture resolutions are high and effects for things like water are far from generic with cloudy patches and Bubbles it is unfortunate that most of the same elements are reused for much of the game as assets from the first level are found in great abundance in later stages and while I appreciate a 2d platformer that doesn't fall into the fire ice and desert level cliches a greater degree of visual variety would have been appreciated the visuals are not the only thing that shifts each of the games tun shift between dimensions in a completely seamless fashion [Music] the original composer for the great Giana sisters Chris hilbeck is responsible for the main tracks while Swedish metal band Maan Supremacy offer their own interpretation of the compositions these are Lively Tunes set in a different tone that is commonly found in most Platformers by favoring shredded guitars over Whimsical Melodies common to most games in the genre it is unfortunate however that there aren't more tracks to enjoy as you near the last third of the game the soundtrack can seem immensely repetitive while perhaps one of the most obscure franchises to be resuscitated in recent memory GI sisters proves itself to be a worthwhile enjoyable experience it's colorful challenging and makes excellent use of a handful of mechanics it is perhaps the best mix of platforming puzzles and reflex based gameplay on the market while The Limited soundtrack and small pull of art assets can make the last portion of the game a little less invigorating than the first it does little to take away from the excellent gameplay if you have conquered Donkey Kong and saved Princess Peach a dozen times from the clutches of Bowser then is time you considered shifting through Dreamland as teenage hero Giana [Music] [Applause] he [Music]"

        "transcript": "hi this is Maria from kinder CCE and today I wanted to show you one of my tricks for easily and quickly hanging student work or anything else from the ceiling in your classroom um I'm in my classroom right now and as you can see I really enjoy hanging things up in the room especially from the lights in the ceiling um I have a train that my students made that's very colorful that's hanging and suspended from the lights here um back behind my desk I have a banner with my name on it and there are two lanterns on from the ceiling that the B Banner is attached to that allows it to hang hanging from the ceiling and Hing from the lights you kind of have to look at and decide the system that works best for you I often hang things from my lights because it's a for me in my own classroom in my own space it's a very temporary it's easy to temporarily hang things from the lights um my lanterns are hanging from the ceiling and they're a little bit more permanent of a piece in my classroom um the train here is hanging from the lights from the trick that I'm going to use right now I previously used to hang things from the lights and I would climb on all of my student desks reach up and i' I've always used paper clips to hang things from the lights so I would like take my paperclip and hang it from the light and then climb on back down and and I would do that several times a year every time I changed out everything that had been hanging from the ceiling I changed it seasonally so several years ago I learned a much better solution from a more seasoned teacher and it's one of those little tricks that once you know how to do you wonder how you ever survived without that trick um so what I end up doing is I have paperclips permanently attached to the lights in my classroom since I often hang things from the light lights and you could use big paper clips or you could use small paper clips for this the small ones don't give you as much space to work with and they're not as sturdy so I usually use the bigger paper clips and all that you need to do to get this ready is to open it up it bends you want to bend it kind of straight the smaller loop I always keep closed up because that's what I use to hook onto the light and then this larger one I open up so that it's accessible to me I still want it to hook out but it's wider and easier to access than it was when it was closed so I usually just kind of do this I take these little clips and the very first time I am hanging anything in my classroom I attach hooks to my lights um currently around my classroom I probably have 35 or 40 of these little Clips just hanging there all the time I don't use 35 or 40 Clips all the time but they're hanging there in case I ever want to change my configuration or if I get more students or whenever I have a need for it they're always there and ready for me all that I do to make these kind of more sturdy on the lights my trick requires these to be somewhat sturdy I just take some clear tape and hook it onto my light and hold it in place with the tape here's a picture right now so you can see what it needs to look like so once you have your paper clips set up around your ceiling or classroom lights as hooks the next thing you need to do is prep your artwork to be hung from the ceiling or whatever it is that you're hanging if it's not artwork it might just be decorations I usually use fishing line to hang all of my things in my classroom I like that it's fairly invisible however for right now I need you to be able to see what I'm doing so I found um dark yarn hopefully this will help you get a clear picture of what's Happening you will need to have a big loop tied around your artwork or whatever it is that you're hanging it's important that it is a gigantic Loop so I cut aole I punched a hole in my artwork took a huge piece of strain looped it through and just tied the top of it this is the exact same thing I do usually except I typically use fishing line once I have my artwork tied up I'm ready to go I just need one one more tool for it I'm going to actually be using a yard stick this is what I use to reach the ceiling so that I don't have to climb my feet stay on the ground and I end up holding the yard stick above my head to be able to reach the hooks what you're going to end up doing once you're when you're extending your arm is you're going to take your artwork and you're going to use your yard stick to hold it um this kind of gets floppy particularly if you're using fishing line so what I do is I take my I hold the art stick with one hand and with the other hand I just kind of hold on to the artwork to stabilize it this way it gets very shaky if you hold on it's much more like fixated so what I'm going to do is um move my hand to the bottom of the fishing line and rather than have the swing around I'm holding on tight with two hands this is the trick that I use to reach up to the ceiling and hook onto my paper clips I'm going to show you exactly what that looks like up close it won't be from the ceiling but it's the exact same effect so here we go since I couldn't capture an image of this happening very well on my actual ceiling hooks I took a paperclip and I just pinned it to my wall here normally my light comes to about here and the clip hangs down off of it so you have to just kind of pretend that this is hanging from the ceiling the effect is the same um I just don't have to reach to be able to do do this that's the only difference so what you're going to do is you're going to take your artwork and your yard stick that I just showed you how to do um hook your artwork onto the yard stick again I usually use fishing line but yarn will make this easier for you to see hold on to it with one hand to sort of stabilize it and you're going to be reaching so this is easier for me in person than it is from the ceiling but it works both ways and all that you do is you take your yard stick and your string you'd be reaching up really high and you just hook it right onto the clip and let go if it seems like the loop is too narrow and there's no way you can get that paper clip in between it like right now it's very very narrow if you turn your yard stick it ends up getting a little bit wider I don't know if you can tell the difference but this if it's like this it's very very narrow turning the yard stick makes for a much more broad Loop that's a lot easier to hook onto sometimes I kind of drop it once or twice um it falls to the floor I put it back on the yard stick and I give it another try even if it takes you a few attempts it's generally easier than climbing around on furniture getting up and down constantly it makes my life so much easier and I hope it does the same thing for you as well this is Maria from kinder craze and I'll see you next time bye"

        "transcript": "[Music] hey guys hope you all it's been a while um but I'm back now and uh starting off with a nice simple one today I got asked by YouTube user uh Drake rocks the UK and she asked me how Drake plays his cover of suie moon beam song centerpiece so I'm going to do my best to uh explain a song here and it's very simple cuz it only uses four chords the the chords are G E minor a7th and D okay but in the cover Drake plays with the ukulele and I'm going to show you exactly the fingerings that he uses for that song and the tunings necessary so without further Ado let's get straight into it now I'm going to share with you guys a nice little tip uh in case you don't have a ukul like I personally don't and uh you'll see that I'm using a classical guitar for this it's not necessary any acoustic works it's just that I find this makes the the closest sound to a ukulele so this is how you can make your acoustic guitar sound like a standard tuned ukulele and all you need is a capo or cppo and you're going to place it onto the fifth fret now if you play the highest four strings that's the closest sound you're going to get to a standard tuned ukulele so you can play all the fingerings minus the the fifth and sixth string the lowest two strings cuz you don't want to play those since they're not present on a ukulele and um you can play any chord like an f using the shapes or a g as you would for a s ukulele so it's a really nice tip and something that I use often um but the only difference in this song is because Drake's ukulele was tuned a whole step up that means that you don't want the Caper on the fifth fret you actually want it on the seventh fret so that was just a a nice little tip for you and uh so let's get on with the the rest of the song okay so the cords for centerpiece whether you're following along with an acoustic or classical guitar like I am uh with a cape on the seventh fret or using a ukulele that's tuned up a whole step uh you'll need to change uh the actual chords themselves to fit in the right key so I'll do that for you now so what you'll need to play is an F A D Minor A g7th and A C okay so I'll show you all the fingerings for those chords so the first one which is f all you're doing is placing the middle finger onto the second fret fourth string and the index finger onto the first fret second string so it's the only those two fingers and you're playing the highest four strings that's an F so that's the first one the second one being a D minor and this is really easy to switch to because you're only adding the ring finger from that F onto the second fret third string and that's it so that is a D Minor the next chord uh the third chord is a g7th and this is also fairly easy to switch to what you can do is from the D Minor release the middle finger and ring finger keep the index finger where it is place the ring finger down onto the first uh string of the second fret and the middle finger onto the third string of the second fret and that makes a g7th now for the final and fourth chord uh this is the easiest of them all this is a c and all you're having to do is Place one finger down onto the third fret first string and that's a c those are all the chords so again it's F D minor g7th and C so it's a really simple song now I what I'll do is I'll uh edit uh Drake's performance and I'll add add the fingerings from these onto there as he's playing it so you can kind of see it in real time so that's all the song is uh I hope you find this useful and uh thanks for watching take care you cannot think about selfish pastor it will never cease I don't want to be your burden life's what you make it grow or your seeds never dream too muched knew the meaning think I stay so keep you're myace life gets better when I feel Fade Away life gets much better when I fade away [Music]"

        "transcript": "what is going on guys it is aiming to shame here back with a new series for free for 14 altered team as you guys see on screen i've built a little squad here mostly a premier league one but if we could look if we look at the right center back we have sergio ramos so i'm not going to classify that as a hybrid but it's got premier league scored plus ramos quite an interesting one to use and you know at the moment i believe you can't spend any money on packs so you kind of got to just use what you've got at the moment guys so i don't really want to go around sending my players just because i don't want to end up making a big loss on them so as you guys see there we are doing online seasons and that is the whole point of my new series here where we're going to go from division 10 all the way to division one and try and win it like on online seasons using fifa 14 ultimate team so very exciting stuff guys a bit like a road to glory except i'm not going to be doing cups at the moment i'm going to do cups as a separate video i don't really want to show you me losing cups i'm really going to show you me winning the cups so what you'll see on my channel at the moment guys is me winning cups and me doing you know some squad builders as well as me doing a kind of like a road to glory on this online seasons but anyway guys we're starting off very well in this game with that one goalie which is exactly what we're looking for i really have mixed opinions on this game so far i would love to sit here and say i love this game so much but i've been getting a little bit frustrated with it recently guys i will be honest and uh the me the reason why it's just because it's changed to be honest guys i'm a bit of a bad loser i guess and you know i've had a bit of a bad start doing the online cups i actually done a two games earlier on today and lost both of them very unfairly as well my stats absolutely i just don't want it to my opposition but it's all because of corners and headers i'm just i'm just failing to do very well in this game at the moment but online seasons i've used the better team now it seems like i may better get the uh they've got to get a hang of fifa 14 ultimate team because as you see at the moment guys i am too new up living the dream here the second half started we did come close to scoring there but the keeper does get it away but now we get taken out there with essien and uh if fifa 13 in this area i always laid it off and then we went for the shot and i'm gonna do the same here but this time i'm gonna go for the finesse just because it's now very overpowered that's exactly what i do and i score the goal there using ramirez guys so watch out on fifa 14 when their shots are well and truly back so for what i've played so far it's quite safe to say finesse shots and headers are just exactly what you want to be doing on this game they all seem to be the most common goals i see it's very rare that i see a power shot go on a power shot going unless it's very close to the goal but as you see guys we just go ahead ourself here with sergio ramos making that five nil my opponent then put the controller down so i just decided to keep the ball in my back four and wait out the game there collecting that five no win which i'm very pleased with that is a great start to the series so as you see we get the three points we're looking for played one one one for online seasons let's see how good we can get our record by the end of this guys and as you see this is a lovely little addition fifa done there i mean i gotta say prop seven for this it's a really good idea it's just got all our stats for like every single game you play on online seasons and i just put it all together so guys it is time to start our second game here hopefully looking for another win if we can but this guy can already tell was a lot of a lot stronger opponent and as you see he does score he takes a lead with lukaku and i've heard great things about him people saying fifa is not about pace anymore i'm gonna have to play a lot more before i make my final decision but it does look like pace isn't as important anymore but luckily danny welbeck does get me the equalizer they're making a one-all we are back in this game and this is quite an exciting one guys because you know my second game division 10 you just feel like you know division 10 has to be a win but at the moment everyone's got a season ticket tennis to know what they're doing on fifa i mean anyone that pays 20 pound to get the game early clearly they know what they're doing on this game they're clearly into it so every single opposition has got a good chance of being a decent opponent so a win is very hard but look at that guys are we that is not a penalty and let's take a look at the replay here that is a penalty sakura's just too strong for this game here he leaps up for the header i didn't do anything apart from his ex that were to win the header and he decided to take him out he wins a penalty he scores it i was very annoyed at that that's kind of the things i mean this game can get very frustrating at the moment but you know i just kind of ignored that for now and i went down the other end and done a near post course and scored the header just because i could see that is the best way to abuse this game at the moment with the headers that's actually how the match ended we win at 3-2 that's our second game of this series so far and we have won both of them had slightly better starts we get the six points we're looking for i am really enjoying this series so far guys and i'm gonna be playing more games later on and uploading them thank you guys for watching if you enjoyed a series or like the sound of it please leave a like creating and uh once again guys thanks for watching"

        "transcript": "are you ready to rumble welcome back once again to Tech of tomorrow I'm El your host and today we're going to bring you something very interesting unless you guys have been living in a rock you know that AMD has released a brand new GPU out into the market now why is this well when AMD looked at their lineup between their 7770 and their 7850 they felt that there was a gap in between there that could be filled and therefore the new HD 7790 was born now today we're going to bring you the review comparison against its little brother card the 7770 which many of you have asked for so with that said let's get ready to rumble and jump in to the ring so now let's talk about some of the basic differences between the new 7790 and its little brother the 7770 now the 7770 its GPU was called cape verie and it actually featured a die that was slightly smaller than the new 7790 the 7790 is based off the new Bonaire GPU and actually this is the very first of the sea Islands to actually hit the market there'll be many more that are coming out but this is the first now stream processors which is really the most important thing about the card is a major difference between the two on the 7790 we see 896 stream processors on the 7770 we see only 640 there also some difference in the total available memory bandwidth now take into consideration that both these cards are overclocked on the 7790 we see a total available memory bandwidth of 102.4 GB per second on the 7770 we see slightly lower at 83.2 GB per second so there is a pretty big difference there now let's talk about the GPU core clock speed one thing to take note of the 7770 is actually clocked higher it's at 1100 MHz on the 7790 the core clock is at 1,075 but the memory speeds on the 77 90 are actually faster we see the memory speeds at 1600 MHz and on the 7770 we see them back to 1300 MHz so there are some differences there as well both cards feature 1 gab of gddr5 memory both cards feature 128bit memory interface all those things are pretty much the same so now let's take a look at the Aesthetics of the card we can see that right off the bat both of these cards feature aftermarket cooling the real difference is one has vaporx which is the 7770 and the 7790 has Dux you also want to take note that both of these cards are Sapphire based cards other cards from other manufacturers will differ in how they're size what the Shroud is and everything else on the card and for those various models and pricing make sure you guys check out the link right below the like button both the cards that we're looking at today feature the same 7-in PCB although the 7770 has a blue PCB and the 7790 has a black one which you know may matter to some people but I don't think it's too much of a concern now let's take a look at the rear io on the rear IO of the 7770 you can see that the card features two dual link DVI connections a single HDMI and a single standard display port on the 7790 however things get a little bit different there's a black port and a white port the black Port is a single link DVI port and the white one is the dual link you also see once again the standard HDMI and standard display port technology now that we've seen the feat differences between the 7770 and the 7790 and we've got that clear in our head let's now jump in and see some performance comparisons now we know that our Red Dawn extreme system isn't you know the absolute highest in gaming system it was meant more for workstation SL gaming but we're kind of waiting for Haswell to come out when Haswell comes out we'll be changing it up and changing out our test system right now we're using the SRX motherboard we're using two 2660 xeons we've got two hyperx drives from Kingston that are in raid Z 80 GB of patriot memory just all kinds of cool stuff including an ocz PCI 256 GB boot drive that's right so this thing really does rock in a lot of circumstances so with that said let's jump in and let's see the testing [Music] [Applause] [Music] n [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so there you have it we've seen the differences in features we've seen the differences in performance and we can see that as far as a sheer performance goes the 7790 does blow away the 7770 although there is a slight Kickback to that the card is actually running quite a bit hotter as well pretty much this new card is running H hot hot hot hot hot now with drivers and stuff and as they do the fan timing and they custom do that maybe it'll actually get better some companies spend a lot lot of time doing custom fan tuning I think with this release they were just trying to pretty much get the card to Market but as the drivers improve and that fan tuning gets better we'll probably actually see some better cooling on the card so if you guys also want to see the full written review on the new radon hd77 90 make sure you guys check that out over on our website www. teoft tomorrow.com where we have all the scores lots more picks and just cool stuff all about this card now in this review we will also have comparisons against all the Nvidia cards which I know you f FKS are wanting to do and also something very cool you guys can click right here in this little link right next to me and go directly over to the review which I think is actually pretty cool feature that they've got here on YouTube like usual I hope you guys like this video If so make sure you guys hit that like button show us that you

        "transcript": "so what's going on guys today we're going to be doing something a little bit different me personally i love ice cream especially in these summer months and the only fast food industry like ice cream place that we have around here is actually only a dairy queen and what dairy queen does is once a month they come out with a new blizzard so i'm going to be doing somewhat of a newish segment here where once a month i'll be reviewing their blizzard of the month there won't be no price rating considering that every place is different especially if you're in a mall or an actual store and whatnot like that the main way i'm going to actually be rating these is pretty much a one through five scale of the one being that they kind of miss the mark completely it's a horrible conception of a flavor and didn't really work out too well and then the five being that the flavors came together really nicely and it's actually what it's supposed to be let me know if that's something you guys are definitely going to be interested in and i'll keep them coming as for now let's go ahead and get into the first one and check it out so visually ice cream is not very much to look at so i'm going to find a few different ways to take some pictures show you the actual ingredients that actually go inside of what i'm gonna be checking out keep it pretty quick and simple and for the first blizzard i'm gonna be reviewing is actually for the month of june and that is s'mores so s'mores is a pretty obvious flavor you're gonna have that graham cracker chocolate and marshmallow and somehow combine that together as for them what they do is they add a marshmallow syrup little bits of chocolate and graham cracker then we get all that nice and mixed up let's go ahead and take a few bites and see how it tastes now honestly like i said not really much to look at here so i'm going to go based on mainly flavor and whatnot try and get a scoop to where you guys could see a little bit got a little bit of the chocolate in there a little graham cracker piece let's go ahead and check it out so s'mores for the month of june is definitely a good conception considering it is the summer months you're going to be all roasted having good fires so the first initial bites you get plenty of flavor coming through right away what they do is they're putting in that marshmallow syrup into the ice cream and then with those chunks of the graham cracker getting mixed up when they blend it it kind of goes all the way throughout the ice cream so you already got the marshmallow flavored ice cream and then bits of graham cracker kind of speckled without and then by taking a bite with a piece of chocolate in it which there is obviously a fair amount in here it works out surprisingly like a s'mores as for each individual element the marshmallow flavor is not too strong i mean obviously it depends on how much they put in there it works enough that you get the nice subtle fact that there is a hint of marshmallow in there as for the graham cracker pieces like i said being that they're originally in little chunks and then they kind of get ground up all in it that also works out nice because then you're getting a little bit of the element in every bite and as for the chocolate being that there is a fair amount in there you're getting pretty much the same thing you're able to take a bite with a piece of chocolate along with the graham cracker and the marshmallow pretty much making the flavors work out nicely now the graham cracker is a little bit on the sweet side and as for the chocolate it's not too sweet it's pretty similar to what a hershey bar would be but i would honestly say maybe not even as sweet as that it's got an overall good flavor and it worked out pretty well honestly i would probably rate this at four and a half out of five as for the first one i'm pretty pleased and i'm also pretty curious if this is something you guys are interested in like i said i personally love ice cream and i have something that i would like to also get into reviewing now this is the blizzard of june but i will actually be doing the one for july which is lemon meringue also that'll be coming up fairly soon but as always thanks for watching guys more videos to come including these so i'll see you in the next one"

        "transcript": "hi my name is Karen I'm one of the bits of cat's protection the UK's leading cat welfare charity and I'm going to talk to you today about some aspects of care hi I'm going to talk to you today about how to make your house cat friendly first of all why would you want to make your house cat friendly well this is because cat quite highly evolved in some way so they had quite specific needs cats of a domestic cat is evolved from the African Wildcat this is a solitary animal that lives outdoors and eats in a certain way and has a lot of of intrinsic habits now domestic cat have carried on a lot of these traits as well the idea of making your house cat friendly is trying to provide all of these needs in a way that's fun and engaging for your cats and sometimes it's not even the obvious things but sometimes it can be really easy and fun the kind of things that your cat needs are going to be similar to what the African Wildcat needs the first thing to know about African Wildcats and hits your domestic cat is actually they tend to like time alone most cats like to be solitary quite often and they don't always need friends so make sure that your cat's got places to go and hide where it can feel comfortable and secure using igloos and covered beds like this can be really useful even just opportunity cardboard boxes can be abuse as well make sure that somewhere to go that is up high a lot of cats like to get up high especially if they feel stressed their coping mechanism so making sure there are window sills or some house high shelves top of wardrobes places like that make sure their tech base so the cat can access them easily cats in the wild eat around about eight to ten small meals per day and it's a good idea with pets inside the house especially if they're in your care i mimic this behavior as in the way that you feed them if all they have is just a bowl full of food that can be quite boring to them so there are a few simple and easy ways you can do to increase their enjoyment of this food balls can be really useful these you can just put dry food and they have little holes that as a cat rolls them around the food falls out and it could be a really good way of engaging your cat and causing it to have a bit more interest in what it's doing it's a great way to exercise your cat as well and smooth cut down on the calories so it can be really useful for overweight cats some simpler and cheap ways of doing this as well is just hiding food around the house especially easier if you're using dry food you can hide food and the small cardboard containers anything that's going to make the cat a little bit more engaged with water for your cat it's important that you separate the food and water bowls a lot of people like to keep them together okay it's actually prefer to keep them apart this comes from their wild and pictures who would always try and keep their prey away from water sources so it doesn't get contaminated it's a good idea to try putting your water bowl in a different location or even having multiple ones need pets to choose from some pets a bit picky about water some of them find their place at water bowls to contain the water and they prefer it out of a ceramic or a seamless steel bowl if I'm kept only like running water again that's goes back to their natural trace and they may like to drink out of a tap or sometimes they can have little water fountains to drink from - cats have a need to scratch their claws for multiple reasons they need to keep their claws healthy but they also need to use the sink lens on their feet and they can use it to mark territory so scratching posts are really important they need to have somewhere to scratch it's a good idea to have one like this where they've got multiple perches and where there the lines are long the truth them toileting is another really important aspect of making your house cat friendly cats can be really picky about where they go to the toilet they like it to be private they like it to be quiet they like it to be clean we wanted a capstan to ferry their their waste so they will need to use something to do that in some cats will go out sometimes and that's absolutely fine but if an outdoor cat may benefit from having the option of using an indoor litter tray with litter trays it's important where you put them cats again don't like to be overlooked that it necessarily like to be beside doors or windows and sometimes a nice quiet corner or using a covered litter tray is really useful playing with your cat is really important cats need to engage in what's called hunting behaviour again it's like they're the natural ancestors some cats will actively hunt them or bring you presents but some cats just will engage and play behavior which limits the same kind of thing pets can endorphins or they feel good when they perform these behaviors that can really help them reduce stress can help keep them happy if you engage and play behavior with them a couple of times a day particularly one of indoor cats that I get some activity it can also help maintain a healthy weight it's a few other things to remember when you're trying to make your house more cat friendly we've got more than one cat it can be very important to provide them with multiple resources this means food and water and toileting opportunities you may need each of these per cat and maybe even a few extras cats don't like to share sometimes they will do if they absolutely have to but it can cause them a lot of internal stress so it's a good idea to have multiple food multiple water bowls and multiple toilets around the home a month and access to these in ways that the cats can get away from each other if you want any more information on the subject log on to keto Guk"

        "transcript": "welcome ladies and gentlemen this is Norm from gotestdrive.ca and uh let me show you 2013 Jeep Wrangler Sahara twoo with a hard top nice aluminum wheels 3.6 V6 pentar engine so uh one of the best engine transmission you can find in the Jeeps right now and in the market actually for the V6 right so you can see it's a nice vehicle it's black on black two door see the cool side steps this is a standard pahara I think you can see all the back so here we go this is almost 300 horsepower engine with 5-speed transmission well gives you almost 300 horsepowers right like I mentioned before but if you look in fuel economy and um between the previous model way better for the fuel economy and way more power and it's actually very quiet engine here's your fog lights this is all your lights you see Sahara come with a painted fenders as well uh four disc brakes ABS tructure control so all the safety features a removable hard top this piece you need somebody's help to take it off just couple screws out and these two plates it's very easy to take them off you just uh take couple bolts out and then you see just open this small T and it's going to take you probably two minutes to do it it's very easy so Sahara also come with a premium sound system you you can see there's a subwoofer in the back this is uh flip over mat right you can uh if you have a ski boots you just put them here if they wet right there's a small compartment underneath and this is a place if you take your doors out or your wind Shel you can put your screws so you're not going to lose them and you see the back seats you just flip them down and you have extra room in the back but if you go guys four people you just put the seat back like this put it back this this is how much room you still has in the back and then you can sit four people no problem twoo it's built only for four people so just let you know right in case if some people don't know and decide to buy and then then get the troubles right because of four seat belts uh side steps heated mirrors in the sides this one has a all the automatic lights actually this is a clawed seats with a really cool material if you drop your liquid it's easy to clean it up maintening so you can see all the cool signs over here um height adjustable it's like a pump you can move it up and you can move it down this is for the re

so uh fuel economy um uh de to empty your gas tank a tire pressure every Tire separate so most important things this is what I like about the Sahara it's got the most important things like Bluetooth every vehicle has must have it because you know everybody always calling want a chat so this is also cool V you can you see flip it over all the way you want that's your power windows here's your power mirrors right why they put everything up front here because if you remove your doors there's a less wiring that's why everything is here and that's actually when you start to get to used to it

stations and um this acceler Bluetooth for the phone connect phone voice recognition so nicely equipped vehicle like I said it's most important and you can have also couple models like a sport and

to help you do something about it now this first meal I make is very very simple it's a salad with a ham and cheese sandwich and a few other accessories nothing complicated just something to get you started and think about what you can do to help yourself when you're Trav traveling so you can eat just a little bit better and have a little bit of fun while you're at it so let's head down to the do and time with Dan kitchen and check out the most basic airline meal okay here we are in the doing time with Dan kitchen at the counter and here is my most basic carry-on meal if you're sitting in coach this meal work out just great for you it is the simplest one that I do I have several others but first let's keep it easy all right let's not get too complicated now everything fits here in this bag so when you're going through security you throw it right on the Belt they x-ray your sandwich you're good to go as you get inside now let's open this up and take a look at what we got we're going to go to the main dish first and like I said I kept this simple it all fits into a dollar store plastic container I paid exactly $1 for this container so you're not out a whole lot of money I use a rubber band just to keep everything closed up okay so you open the top and inside what do we have here we have lipin te and honey you can mix this with water so you don't have to pay for a drink on the plane you just ask for a glass of ice water mix that in you have a refreshing drink we have a plastic fork here we have a salad and notice inside the salad I have uh carrots and radishes iceberg lettuce you could make a spinach salad or anything else you'd like and I use one of these other Dollar Store cups I paid a dollar for six of these so the only reason I'm making a point of how much all this cost is if you have to throw all this away when you get to your destination you're not out a whole lot of money so that's our salad and dressing right there and inside I have basically a half a ham and cheese sandwich I'm going to open that up and show it to you in just a few seconds okay but here's your uh the bottom side of your plastic Dollar Store container I have a paper towel in here which is great CU you're going to use that for your place mat when you're sitting at the table just open that up like that set your dish on top move it over here into the frame take out your dressing and you're going to pour out your [Applause] salad all right there we go and as you can see that's a fair amount of salad there okay chunky there carrots celery all kind of good stuff take your dressing I choose an Italian vinegret something that doesn't need to be refrigerated pour that on and you have your fork you're ready to go that's your salad great way to start a meal on an airplane not too heavy now you're looking for something a little more substantial so we're going to get into the ham and cheese so you're finished with this you might want to save this for later put all the trash inside and then get rid of it or take it get back and rinse it out whatever you want to do I'm just going to put it on the side for right now now this is the ham and cheese sandwich now notice that I also wrapped it in a paper towel right away in case you can't wash your hands or need an extra paper towel to keep things tidy I like a whole grain bread stands up better and uh lasts a little bit longer than your white bread you can make whatever you want but you can see that's a pretty good size sandwich for two three even a 4H hour flight that'll hold you over now you say to yourself well Dan that's okay but I need some accessories and that's what we have in the Dan accessory pack now in here I packed some crackers and cheese commonly available at any grocery store convenience store that'll uh help fill you up give you some crunch with your meal I also made my own pack of peanuts and pistachios these are really good and it's more than you're going to get in those little bags on the plane so they also help to fill you up peanuts and have a lot of protein in them also a lot of fat so be careful with that and then in the rest of the accessory pack we have some Charmin

        "transcript": "hi guys and welcome to this second video on share Factory tutorials this next video is going to show you how to split your clip and add a transition in between the the split Clips so you can get a nice merge in between uh the two parts that you want to select so um here we are back at the first video we made in lesson one uh and I want to find a particular bit that I do not want you to see it's pretty boring it's after a Kill and uh there's a couple of seconds in between that and the next kill so I'm going to find uh the moment where I want this video to end right about there 56 seconds and fast forward to the part where I want uh to to pick up the next part of the clip so I want to cut out the bits between uh the 56 second there and here the 1 minute 9 seconds or 1 minute 8 seconds or whatever I end up doing um so this is how you do it there's a split clip feature so if you go all the way back to that 50 seconds and uh if you go to the toolbar which is the square button and select split clip this will pretty much draw a line right where you uh where you want it to and it will cut your entire content into two pieces um but the the trick here is that you can split the clip again um fast forward from this point onto the point where you want to to to to cut out so that whole section that you want to cut um which is around about round about here and you hit the same button you press the x button again to split that clip the second time and you'll notice uh as soon as you do that and you confirm uh it will have chopped your entire video into pretty much three pieces that middle section there is the part that we want to remove nobody wants to see that boring right so um next thing you need to do as you can see at the bottom of the screen the a trash can or a garbage bin um you just press the square button to delete the clip confirm that you want to delete that clip and uh as soon as you do that the that particular piece of your video is gone um the previous part and The Following part if you did play it at that point would just follow seamlessly from one into the other again press R2 to play at normal speed and you can see as you transition it jumps from One Clip uh straight in into the next one and we want to make this a nice sort of jump from one to the other we don't want this to be uh too confusing for people who are watching it or at least make it easier on the eye so uh the next thing we want to do here is add a transition you must remember when you're in this split clip mode see at the top of the screen split clip you have to press the circle button to back out you need to back out to the previous menu where you can select uh something else to add to your video and uh what we're going to add here is a transition between the two clips I'm going to Mak it smooth so remember to press press the x button uh to add something always add something with the x button and we're going to add a transition uh here you go you got the screen for all kinds of transitions these are all defaults um you can cross fade fade fade from black Fade to Black um there's a couple of others here on the left hand side if you move around the screen move to the left you can you can have a look down you can see there's some cinematic ones some nice PS4 yeah self-promotion uh kind of uh wipes in between the two um ow you to make some kind of funky transition between the two it's it's they're all really cool they all look really good on screen and you can choose whatever you like play around remember you can press R2 to play through each one just to see what it would look like um but the one I'm going to go for is a a pretty simple one I think personally I think it looks the most uh clean but uh it all depends on what kind of video you're trying to make you might be making a montage you want something more explosive in between the two actually we'll come back to some effects later but this one here the uh the cross fade is that's my favorite at the moment I quite like it it's simple yet effective so have fun with these transitions there are so many to pick from and they all look good they all look great uh here we just press R2 again just a place through a clip at normal speed and this shows you exactly how that transition Works fading from one to the other uh personally I think it looks great just remember if you want to edit the transition or you want to just delete it try something else whatever you want to do you can press the square button uh which has got the uh the spanner icon which will allow you to edit and then you can delete you can change you can do what you like guys I hope you like this video um remember to save and exit your project and I will be back for the next tutorial uh hope you liked it guys please subscribe good night"
