        "transcript": "[Music] hi I'm Alice Osborne and I'm here today with Mike Olen one of the owners of Shirley J and Mike is going to give us some in-depth information today on another fantastic Shirley Jay product the white cheddar sauce can we say it's Universal as well absolutely very Universal exactly like our Universal uh cream sauce okay in its applications actually so okay well tell us about that what makes it so Universal well let me let me tell you a little bit about the sauce itself first I I love this sauce I love this product so much it's one of our I think one of our little Treasures uh I love it because of the flavor of it and the ease and the versatility let me let me just back up when you make a a white sauce Alice at home what's the first thing you do oh well I melt some butter and then I add the amount of flour the recipe calls for I think that's called a rue or something stir stir stir melt melt melt right and then it says to add some liquid usually cream or milk that's and that's where I really start to Fumble things get kind of curdle your something and most people do because if you add the milk too quickly the sauce will fail and lump if you add it too slowly it takes you forever and it breaks and curdles the sauce is a very delicate sauce one of the great things about our sauce line are Universal sauce as well as our white cheddar sauce is that they're very very simple and easy to use you don't have to melt butter you don't have to add flour you don't have to add cream you don't have to go to the grocery store and buy all those products and you don't have to work with them for hours on the stove to create this delicate sauce now well that's the other thing I always had to babysit it you do you do and then if you're making a cheese sauce if you're making macaroni and cheese or one of your favorite casseres or potato agen any of those agen dishes the next thing you have to do is add cheese to that right right and then you have to stir it again and the cheese has oil in it that separates and all kinds of problems can happen when you make an AG Gren sauce at home our white cheddar sauce is simple you just add water to it put it on the stove stir it quickly the product dissolves in the water and you bring it to a simmer and you're done really and you're done and not only are you done quickly the end result is as wonderful a white cheddar sauce as you'll ever taste let me ask does it Scorch cuz mine scorches one one I'm making from scratch you know Alice I mean you can burn anything but this this product is very resilient to that when you make your your sauce at home you melt the butter and add the flour to it and it coats your pan with a film that scorches very easily as you found out by making it at home our product when you stir it in with water it's a it's a liquid product very very quick and easy to use and you can actually stir it in and leave it and uh you know if you make sure that it doesn't boil over you could just leave it unattended for for a long time and it would never burn because it's just so easy to it's uh it's exactly like the universal sauce uh in in any uh of our application ways so and and all the the benefits of use so if you want to freeze the product if you want to use it directly out of the cooler from from cold state if you want to microwave it if you want to if you want to cook this um bake it in an oven say you're making as I mentioned a grotten potatoes if you want to put this in your ARR potato recipe put it in the oven and boil it bake it for hours if you needed to uh the product would never compromise or break so yeah any I mean you really can't ruin this product it'll take a lot of effort to to to ruin our product it's just so easy to use what about adding acidic foods like say tomatoes to it sure would that separate it sure and again going back to your homemade sauce if you're making a homemade sauce and want to add tomatoes to it almost instantly it'll curle because the acid in the in the sauce so it's disaster if you wanted to make a beautiful um creamy tomato sauce with a cheddar flavor this would be a wonderful like a pasta sauce uh this would be a great thing to do just make our sauce and add a little bit of tomato sauce to it depending on your own recipe or desire and again you can hold it forever and it would be just beautiful never have to curdle worry about curdling what are some favorite recipes you like to make with it what what do you do with this I'll tell you the I think the most popular use for this and it sounds kind of funny but the most popular use for this product is simply as an alfredo sauce okay by itself with the addition of nothing else it's really got a beautiful little uh dry cheddar flavor that really imparts a a great feel of a great alfredo sauce and you can also use it for things like nachos you can use it for a k a great queso dip macaroni and cheese and you can add more cheese to it if you want or you can leave it exactly like it is you can take it down so many different roads well what about this nutritional value if you make a white sauce or a cheese sauce at home you're going to be talking about 4 to 600 calories per cup yeah that's true depending on your recipe per cup of finished product now we all love those sauces and we love to eat them and the reason we do is because they they're so tasty yes and the taste has a has a drawback and that's the the bad calorie count and other things that happen with the with those scratch sauces that we make our product if you if you uh were to make one cup of our product it has 170 calories in addition to that no trans fats no added MSG no hydrogenated oils here's the calorie savings right there that's right that's right it's an amazing product and we formulate our product using heart healthy sunflower oil wow sunflower oil is uh is a is a really great uh heart healthy oil that's high in omega-3 and Omega 6 essential fatty acids and it's uh and it's just makes it that much more healthy and and EAS and if you combine that with the ease of use and the and the versatility I mean you've got a winning product hasn't this been fun thank you so much it's been wonderful to learn more about this great product now if you're interested in more information on Shirley J this product and others and if you want some recipes to go along with with how to use this product just go to website Shirley j.com well until we meet again thanks so much for joining us and happy cooking [Music]"

        "transcript": "hey guys it's Kenzie and today I'm doing my what I got for Christmas video and I'm really sorry if you can hear the washer in the background the washer is actually like on the other side of this wall and my brother would kill me if I turned it off cuz his clothes are in there so I'm really sorry I had a really good Christmas and I hope that you guys did too so Christmas was yesterday and I was super busy with family and I had just gotten in from California and I was so tired so I fell asleep for a little bit and I did not have time to film and edit this video yesterday but I'm doing it today so these are just from my family because my friends and I have an exchange gifts like any of my friends um and I'm probably doing that today with my other friend so follow me on Instagram if you want to see what it is cuz I'll probably post it the first present that my mom and dad got me was actually a complete surprise and I vlogged it and it was a couple days ago they had sent to my house in California an iMac and that is absolutely crazy the lighting is changing it's absolutely crazy I needed one really badly and I was saving up my money and I had almost gotten it and they had gotten it for me this lighting so they had gotten me an iMac which is probably the biggest present I've ever gotten for Christmas so it's not normal for someone to get an iMac for Christmas and my family okay this video and I love it so much and if you guys want to see me opening it I vlogged it so you can click the screen right here or it'll be a link down below and then the second present that my parents got me was in this really cute ring box and it's actually a Pandora ring which I didn't even know that they had this kind of thing and I think it's super cute it only fits my thumb um but it is just a bow detailed ring with I don't really know those aren't real diamonds I don't really know but it's really cute and I love it and I already instagrammed it uh a picture of my hand and I am obsessed with this ring the next present that I opened for my parents is this and you can already tell what it is by the box and I opened it and I fell in love with this travel mug I always take coffee to go and I'm always running out of travel mugs so I'm really excited that I got this one and it's really really pretty It kind of just is like tribally almost I don't really know what the design is but it's really nice and really big which I like because I like a lot of coffee also I got so many gift cards to Starbucks that one thing thing that I love about everybody knowing I love Starbucks is that I get Starbucks gift cards I think I've received about seven of them already the next thing that my parents got me was a set of pajamas my mom does this every single year for Christmas we all get pajamas and the one that I got this year was the gray kind of what is this like FL not flannel um kind of waffle type pajamas from Pink and I love the pattern so much and I also got the pants which I'm wearing right now because they're very comfortable and they just have like yeah the last thing my parents got me for Christmas was the Sonicare toothbrush and I've been waning this for a very long time and I mentioned it to my mother one time cuz I almost bought it and then I was like H I'm going to wait till it goes on sale and then it did go on sale while I was on the phone with her and I was like oh I'm going to buy it and she's like don't buy it so I got it for Christmas and I really really love this toothbrush I've already used it and it's pretty dang good like this and it's in the color green which I like it's like a very pastel green and it's really loud so I love this and it's really weird for me to love a toothbrush but I've really been wanting it so I'm happy that I have now for what my sister got me my older sister Shelly she got me a Starbucks gift card first of all and then second of all she got this customade uh travel mug for me and my mom and mine says this aunt is loved by Landon and Charlie and it's in my favorite color and my mom ISS in her favorite color her says this this grandma is Love by Charlie L Charlie I think um but yes I love it and I love that she custom made it and she also got me this bumper sticker which is really cool it's like a Mickey kind of I don't know it's different but I always lose my car and I actually just took off the bumper sticker she got me like a year or two ago because it was peeling so now I have another one uh so that I don't lose my car next my grandmother got me something really thoughtful first of all she got me a Sephora gift card and then she made something for me which is I laughed really really hard when I open this gift because it is very true so first of all it's a t-shirt that she made the back of it has my Vlog Channel link on it which is just very funny she watches all of my Vlogs I think maybe I don't know she watches a lot of my Vlogs and the front says I'm so tired with a bunch of coffee symbols because I think I say that in every single one of my Vlogs I'm so tired but um she has a kick out of that so thank you nana I love watching what people have in their stockings because it's just really cute little things and my mom fills it mostly with a bunch of candy which is always nice so the first thing that I've already opened is this gadell peppermint bark which has recently been my favorite chocolate uh for the holiday so I'm happy that I have that is one of these little Hershey Kiss candy cane type things that are essential for Christmas the next thing she got me she gets this every single year and it's the Lifesaver like little story book things and I think it's cute that she keeps it the tradition like I think I've gotten this ever since I was little thing she got me is toothpaste which is nice because I did not bring any toothpaste or toothbrush with me on this trip because I normally don't I'll just get them at Target but it was Christmas day so uh every store was closed so I was very happy to get this my stocking are these really fuzzy socks and they're nice cuz they go up probably to like my calf I also just wanted to show off my really cool pajamas the lighting really love these and they're super soft they're by the brand Gillian and Ali I think probably from Target and then it's probably more candy and chocolate and she got me one of these really cute kisses Santa hats and it's one of those like little well it's bigger than a Hershey Kiss but you know what I mean okay yeah she also got me this Blistex raspberry lemonade blast ChapStick and I got this last year from her and I actually lost it but it was my favorite chapstick ever cuz it tastes and smells so good I don't know why I'd be tasting chapstick but it's so amazing and I'm so excited that I have more that I got were a bunch of these well I only got three but I already ate one the Lindor truffle chocolates which are so good and then she got me two packs of gum I got the Juicy Fruit and the orbit uh I think this is actually my favorite flavor it's like the vanilla mint I don't really remember what it's called cuz it doesn't say it on the package but this is my absolute favorite flavor of gum so I'm excited that I have this sweet mint I think sweet mint and then lastly I got one of these St Ives apricot scrubs for my face and body if I want it I don't know I can do whatever I want so thank you guys so much for watching if you guys liked anything that I got for Christmas then like this video I can't believe that I got an iMac I'm still like super in shock so instead of all these presents comment down below one thing that you did on Christmas that you just had fun with or your favorite thing that happened on Christmas if you don't celebrate Christmas what your favorite part of the new year is going to be and I will see you guys next time bye"

        "transcript": "[Music] hi Crafters this is Crafty savy and I'm here to share a project with you that I've been working on for um the last um little while um this is a journal I made for someone who is very dear to me and they've asked that I make a journal for someone very dear to them so um this journal happens to be for um a lady named Liz and her very special dog named Daisy um Daisy is an 8-year-old Schnoodle and she's a therapy dog with St John Ambulance uh she visits schools um autistic children um universities for uh students distressing at or trying to distress at exam time and many many seniors who um look forward to seeing her every day um recently Daisy had a fall and severely injured her spine she needed surgery um to be able to walk again along with many hours of therapy so Liz that's Daisy's owner has had um obviously many stories and experiences and photos um to share about Daisy who happens to also be called an angel in a fur coat and she is super cute so um this journal I hope is going to be the perfect place um for her to store all the memories between herself and Daisy and all of the clients that she has and it can easily fit into her purse and and she can share it with everybody who wants to see it so I'm just going to first tell you um I got the idea for the actual journal from uh Michelle over at the paper addiction and she had some ideas sort of about a journal like this using envelopes and so I just found a whole bunch of envelopes you can see some of them are from Canada Post those might be my bills I don't know but we put um I put a whole bunch of them together all random shapes and sizes going in different directions um some of them I have flaps for and I cut the edges off so I can put tags in um so there's really quite a a lot of them and might not look like too many here but once I started covering them in um decorative paper I found that uh there was going to be tons and tons of space for um photos and journaling so the other thing I wanted to say is that I used uh the memories documented paper pad from Recollections really is quite beautiful I did a lot of distressing with Tim Holtz distress ink uh I just put a few fate uh flowers on the front it's called Daisy smiles and there's some charms on the side I don't know how well you can see them and I put a buckle on it from that's from Tim Holtz and that's the back side so I'll just give you a quick run through it won't take too long hopefully I can get this open without a problem the hardest part was putting that book on and so so this is the inside of the journal um one of the important things that um Lynn wanted me to do um for Liz is to give her plenty of places to write and document um stories about Daisy's visits and um trips to different places and um probably about the unfortunate you know accident that she um recently had she is getting better however by the way just so that you know um lots of therapy and um so most of the tags I put in um you know either have some place to write on the front of them or um on the back I tried to do some stamping and we all know how good my stamping is but I also provided envelopes and tags and um lots of pull outs so there's I don't know how well you can see but journaling spots there um and this paper actually worked out quite well even though it is mostly for a dog um it's very pretty and so here are some of those tags more journaling spots um some of the cutouts from this paper pad were really nice so she can check off different things if she wants to or just even those decorative elements but these are still all all the envelopes that I used I just covered them up with the paper and um have a lot of really nice sayings and I think this album is really a nice reflection of who um Liz is she's a very caring um generous person so um the I just added some twine and I hide some things inside those envelopes so lots of flips and flaps and places for journaling I really hope that she likes it uh as much as it was really really a joy to make this album so I'm actually hoping to make more so more [Music] tags more journaling spots this is really nice happiness is in the journey not in the destination and more flaps places for journaling the paper is so [Music] beautiful so oops so there's another um envelope there on the back that she can hide stuff in so that's basically it that's the last page so lots of envelopes and places for journaling I use some washi tape and so that's about it so I just wanted to share that with you that's what I've been working on I've also been busy with a few craft sales Christmas craft sales so I've been so busy but I can't wait to make another video and post really soon so thanks for watching and I hope this gives you some inspiration and um have a wonderful holiday and we'll talk to you soon take care bye [Music]"

        "transcript": "foreign I was there at the midnight release I picked up that I picked up a few games and of course I picked up the uh the mandatory for online play Playstation Plus now I wasn't as I wasn't as worked up as the average gamer was about this because I had already been paying 60 a year to be part of the Microsoft uh Xbox Live Gold so for some of the people that were in Sony's Camp uh the generation before it wasn't as big of a deal for me because I had already been paying uh ten dollars more to be you know on Microsoft's equivalent but that's completely besides the point now what up experience as the time has gone on is just how great of a service that PlayStation Plus really is you know I've heard many people talk about it back in the PS3 days of you know oh we're getting gray gains we're getting great titles you know every single month we're getting two or three and I was just like you know whatever and they can't be good games it's not cool whatever I was just denying it but now that I'm in that driver's seat and I'm the one getting those benefits every single month we've gotten one game for the PS4 which you know doesn't seem like a lot but for someone who doesn't have a bunch of money as a college student one one new game a month one fresh game a month to play for free is a really great deal and especially you know they're not titles that came out four or five years ago these are games like Outlast you know uh we got Dead Nation just this month which is a great game if you haven't downloaded it yet be sure to do so but just this this uh this feeling of you know you're gonna get a free game every month it's gonna be a good game it's not just gonna be you know some game that they threw in there just because it's such a great feeling to know that your money is going towards something great another great aspect of this that I found myself doing is you can go on the PlayStation Store through a web browser and you can download the licenses for other games like the PS3 and the PS Vita now these these have been pretty great games as well so I found myself downloading as many PSV games as they offer because it's almost enticing me to pick up a PS Vita which I had almost no want to buy in the first place so you might be asking what's made you uh totally flip ends and switch camps on this matter about the PS Vita well it's because of PlayStation Plus if I would have just jumped into a PS Vita without PlayStation Plus and without this library of games I would have had to go on buy a bunch of games I would have to go out you know and spend the extra money but now I can go out and buy Vita buy a memory card and just be set I won't have to go out and buy four games I want to go and buy three games I already have a nice chunk of games already pre-downloaded which is a great great feature that Sony offers us with PlayStation Plus and it almost makes you feel like I kind of feel dumb I I wish I would have switched sooner so that I could download more video games I could download even PS3 games you know maybe when the PS3 is 150 bucks I might go out and pick up a PS3 just to download some of the PlayStation plus games that they're just now because it's such a great value you know these games they're still 20 30 40. some are even 50 games still that they're getting so it's a little up in the air whether or not I I might actually be going back out and picking up Evita down the road picking up a PS3 and of course we're still getting great games to the PS4 so I I just wanted to take this video and take this time to tell you guys that PlayStation Plus is uh is a great great service and if if you're on the fence of whether or not you want to pick it up or not it is completely worth the 50 a year the subscription is worth it you know the free games the online multiplayer for the PS4 everything that it offers is great I don't want to come off as sounding like a fanboy but honestly in my eyes from someone who's experienced both sides of the fence uh the pasture is much greener on the Sony side compared to the Microsoft's uh their Xbox games with gold type of thing so thanks for watching guys be sure to hit the Subscribe button down below uh hit the Thumbs Up Button if you enjoyed what you saw be sure to hit the comments I want to hear what your thoughts on Playstation pluses uh do you hate it do you love it do you think it should be 40 30 do you think it should be 60 70 um and yeah I just want to hear your thoughts be sure to tune in for my next video and thanks for watching"

        "transcript": "you if you like making videos to promote your business or yourself for that matter it's probably going to be a lot smoother and a lot better delivery in this video if you're using a teleprompter now if you go on the internet and look at how much a teleprompter costs you'll quickly have a jaw dropping moment because they are a fortune and when i say fortune i mean fortune they're over in excess of a thousand dollars for a simple teleprompter you can have something equivalent for a fraction of the cost now if you search on youtube for ipad teleprompter you're gonna see dozens of videos that are showing you how to jimmy rig make a teleprompter using your ipad for five dollars or ten dollars now i like to do it myself i don't mind these do-it-yourself projects however there's certain things that i don't even want to attempt i don't want some cheesy solution and if you look at most of them they all look pretty ghetto and cheesy and that's not what i'm after so what i did is i went to ebay and i saw what was there and there is one person selling something and it's kind of like a craft type of product and i knew it was going to be a craft type of product uh when i bought it uh but i thought hey it's not gonna be uh that much of a risk financially it was only fifty dollars and ten dollars to ship and it was shipping out of texas and that was at the time of making this video and that's what it was costing so i'm going to show you that product right now and show you how it works so you can decide if that's something that a you want to figure out how to make yourself or b just go ahead and and why waste the hour to buying items and assembling when you could just pay fifty dollars and get it done and over with so anyways the concept of a teleprompter is simple and here it is right here now i knew when i purchased it that it was going to be kind of a craft type of product and so what you have here is as it appears is almost like two picture frames and there is a joint here and a joint here holding it together there's a couple drill marks there with some pegs now the bottom of it has kind of a uh like a particle board and uh what was really nice and unexpected there's a screw for a tripod mount and that's what you see there is my my quick release bracket screwed into the bottom of this but it can mount to a standard teleprompter and you have some glass here and the seller put a tint on it and it's a reflective tint which is required in order for this to work so the way it works is you have your video camera on a tripod and then you have this on a tripod right in front of that video camera and so the video camera will be like this and what you do is you take your ipad and you lay it right here face up there's plenty of applications for the ipad that allow you to um have it display your script in this way where it's in reverse and it reflects so once you have this in front of the camera you have your ipad in there and whatever your speech is or whatever you're presenting uh what you do is it and this was also nice it came with this black cloth and what you do with this black cloth is there's a velcro strip here a velcro strip here but as you can see it's not sewn in it's just stuck on and it might be hard to see actually but it actually came off of the cloth anyways you uh have the cloth velcro on the two slides and then have the black crop cloth drape over the video camera and then what that does is it makes it all dark in this area and you're able to get a really good reflection so anyways for fifty dollars and ten dollars shipping uh this is not bad it's it could passes something that looks very professional so if you were doing a semi pro shoot and you're out in the field you're not going to look like a it's just a hack job so i would definitely recommend this it's quick it's painless it's easy to buy now a couple things that i noticed number one i just noticed this now the velcro came off of the cloth not good it should be sewn in or or something along those lines so i'll have to fix that later secondly this is just a normal tint it's not the real teleprompter glass which is fine it's going to work fine anyway however it wasn't applied well there's a couple bubble spots and if you've ever seen a bad tint job on a car that's kind of what this looks like to me which it doesn't affect the video too much so i wouldn't worry about it but i definitely wasn't happy about that um so anyways and you can see right here the glass is kind of glo glued in and then those metal fasteners that are typical with a picture framer right there so anyways there you have it you really can't beat it for 50 bucks especially with the tripod mount to it so you know you do get what you pay for and this wasn't bad it's much better than the other video saying spend five dollars and cut up your ipod ipad box anyways here i am with another product review thank you for watching this channel and remember to subscribe and tell your friends"

        "transcript": "so today I'm making a hammer that has this pattern on it these have to be the best deal on the planet this is a ball peen ball of pain however you'd like to say it it's a hammer that's made for hitting steel the only other hammer that's made for hitting steel is a chasing hammer and you can always tell by the face how rough it is that it's been used for hitting steel precious metal and put marks in it done like this now to modify this to get one of these to modify for it an embossing hammer or a pattern ever go to a swamp Mart swap meet car boot sale whatever you call it and these are always very plentiful because every fledgling mechanic has one in his toolbox and then they get sold on later to check this out take your number two cut flat hand file and pass it over the hammer if it bites in it hasn't been hardened and then you can do pretty much anything to it you can saw and drill it whatever if it's been hardened like this one you're going to have to use a carbide cutting disc or a diamond drill or a diamond bur to put a pattern on it I tend to use the carbide disc so this is just a screw mandrel like like you would normally have for an abrasive wheel so I'll just show you quickly so this is just a screw mandrel little 'this disc on ya and these are the discs I use and when you use these be sure to wear safety glasses because these are very fragile and it doesn't take much to break them when it breaks when it shatters it sends little bits everywhere just make sure you don't get it in your eyes so when I put the disc on I just run it hand tight and that's all you need because the way this turns is self tightening now what I like is a slightly rounded face on the hammer if it's dead flat it's hard to get a decent pattern when you're hammering dead flatten material if it's just slightly rounded it works good for either slightly rounded material or flat now what I'm going to do is just draw a series of Chevron's starting at the top of the hammer and then as I hammer I can lean the hammer because it's slightly curved then I can get a different part of the hammer the different part of the pattern so I'm just going to do this by eye we want a nice deep cut yeah and you can tell by the color of the sparks coming out that the middle has been hardened now the great thing about these hammers is they're so cheap that you can just get one make a specific pattern on it and you don't have to worry about using it for anything else now putting the pattern on the ball on the back is kind of worthless because it's such a small area so what I do is I would grind this down so that you have a little bit larger area it can be flat and then you can do another pattern on the back otherwise it's it's kind of pointless putting a pattern just on the very end so you can see I've just cut a series of straight lines in the hammer you can you can do a curve with that cut off disk that's what they called the carbide disc but be very very gentle with your curve if you catch it in the groove it just shatters the disks so just going to touch up the face a little bit with my four hundred paper on my sanding stick and we're ready to test out the hammer to see what kind of pattern look good so we'll need a piece of annealed middle so I have a piece of brass that I annealed it I'm leaving a toxin oxidize so I can show you the color actually so I can show you the pattern so initially I'm going to lean the hammer forward and get this front edge they'll just do that down one side and then I'll lean it back and get the back edge not much difference but a little I'll just scrub this off so you can see so this was done with the front edge of the hammer and this was done with the back it's slightly different I like it anyway when you have one of these patterned hammers don't be tempted to use it to hit one of your steel tools if you need if you need to hit something what you do is you turn it sideways so that you hit the tool with the side of the hammer and there doesn't damage your pattern yep very handy and it's the same thing with your regular planishing hammer don't ever be tempted to hit a steel tool with your planishing hammer because you'll damage it pick up a chasing hammer or a regular old beaten up ball-peen hammer to use to hit a steel tool so that's it nice and simple"

Fuck, we were without any... any... Eggplants! Let's cut the eggplants' cap. So cool. Then we cut very very thin slices. And straight. Especially straight. Not like I did. Maybe if you have\na better knife than that crap... We later put the slices on\nblotting paper... We didn't have any so we used\ntoilet paper. Though... yeah, you should use\nproper blotting paper, not the toilet one. A bit more higienic. Oh, and then we sprinkle fine salt. On the slices. Did you say 'go'? Yeah! Ah no. Okay. Sorry. So! Another important thing to say is that uhm... After sprinkling salt on the eggplants,\nthey'll release a lot of water, so in order to avoid it'll splurt all over\nafter being dropped in boiling oil, we'd better dry them up.\nLet's take a towel... ...Mystery... And we lay it on the eggplants. Let's give it a good squash... And that's it. Now we prepare to... ah!\nLet's fry in oil... What's the name, peanut oil. Let's not deep fry them, since we're\ngoing to cook them again later. Toilet paper... We then lay the slices on blotted paper,\nafter they're gilded, drain the oil... I only remember that you spoke in the\nprevious segment, no clue on what happens next Of course, just imagine how much bullshit\nwe're gonna say, and how many times we'll cut... We're back on the pizza here - Let's spread our tomato sauce\n- Oh no, I had to accelerate this... Oh well, who cares. So yeah, we spread the sauce.\nWe've got more time to blab. So nice. I put too much tomato sauce this uhm... - this time, so if you do it, be wary.\n- Parmesan! Don't be a fool. I think you speak here.\nYou say your usual things on parmesan. Oh yeah. Parmesan is good,\nis pretty, use as much as you want. Now we get our fried eggplants...\nbut maybe I already say this? I don't... Nah, nah, maybe you don't here. Then, let's spread our fried eggplants\nall over on top, like this So nice! Then we get some more tomato sauce\nand drop it on top again. Because it's good, it's nice. Now again, parmesan\nlike there's no tomorrow. Ciao dear, enjoy your stay\nin the oven. I think you speak here, too. You sang before, and now you speak. Okay, now we get our mozzarella... Who knows how it'll come out, with\nfour voices at the same time... An abominable crap... No, we can't cut it anyway. Meh, okay. We're so fucking lazy! Oh, smell the perfume!\nSmell it smell it! Aww, you people can't smell it! - The ending is a bit brutal...\n- Yeah, yeah 's all good. A bit... yeah. - Whatever\n- We'll add something... That's all! Do I have to talk?\nOkay then... Then I don't know the rest. Is that all!? It's a bit tiresome on my neck. If you had to shorten in... in 10 words, this goodbye? You talk too much. It was nice while it lasted,\nnow it's over... Ciao. Go! What? Try to do it in rhymes! It was nice while it lasted... My dog's agitated, Ciao!"

        "transcript": "with the introduction of the government's renewable heat incentive there's a lot of interest at the moment in wood chip biomass district heating systems if you actually haven't seen one operating it's sometimes very hard to understand how they operate and how effective they can actually be and as i am promoting myself as an installer and operator of woodchip biomass district heating systems i've prepared a small video to try and show in as clearly as possible how they work and how effective they can be for any wood chipped based heating system the fuel will arrive as quite small pieces of softwood or wood hardwood could be delivered ready ready chipped or it could be delivered as logs which are stored outside to season and then chipped on site either way the chip should be less than 30 moisture content and preferably about 20 percent the chips themselves are really quite light and they are difficult to move they're not like a liquid so you can't rely on gravity you can't rely on a pump to push them so most biomass systems use what's called a sweep and auger to feed the chips into the boiler when the chip arrives it will be dumped on top of a sweeping auger so normally this wouldn't be visible but as this is almost empty you can see how the sweeper arms pull the chip into the auger and then the auger transfers the chip through the wall to the boiler on the other side once the chip has come through the wall which must provide at least an hour's fire resistance it is dropped through a valve into another auger this valve prevents any chance of fire from the boiler getting into the wood chips store the lower auger feeds the wood chip into the furnace where it is burnt if the boiler is cold or has not been alight for some time there is an electrical igniter which will light the chip until it's hot enough to burn itself the fire itself is in a refractory lined chamber with it with air blown in the correct proportions to promote efficient combustion the exhaust is constantly monitored by an oxygen detector called a lambda probe so the boiler can adjust itself to ensure that all the chip and exhaust gases are completely burnt and combustion is as efficient as possible over 90 efficiency is claimed by most manufacturers the boiler is so efficient at extracting all the heat and transferring it to the water jacket that it's quite possible to place your hand on the uninsulated part of the chimney in fact chimney gases are normally only about 120 degrees and very little smoke is produced the water that surrounds the boiler is heated to about 80 degrees and is then pumped through this insulated metal pipework either to a large insulated storage tank or out to an underground pipe when the boiler is running it will be providing heat for any of the buildings that are connected to the system and any surplus heat is used to heat this tank when the tank is fully charged the boiler will switch off and the reservoir of heat in the tank will run the system for some time biomass boilers are not able to tick over efficiently they work much better at full load which is what this tank allows them to do it also gives an extra amount of heat if demand exceeds the boiler's capacity at any time this is the pump which pumps all the hot water around the system it's really just the same as you might have in your own central heating system except bigger it's sensible to use a double one so that you have a backup in the event of failure once the pipe goes underground it changes to this super flexible super insulated pipe normally the pipe work will be a twin pipe consisting of a flow and a return pipe encased in a large amount of insulation the hot water from the boiler is pumped to any of the buildings that are connected on the system and the cooler return water comes back to the boiler through the other pipe this pipe can be used to transfer hot water over surprisingly long distances up to a kilometer is possible in this district heating scheme there's no property closer than 120 meters to the boiler and two are over 300 meters away in this case there's a temperature drop of about three degrees between the boiler and the furthest property away which has no effect on the heating system within the house once the pipe reaches the building that it is serving it comes out of the ground and into a suitable space such as the existing boiler room here it is connected to the property's central heating system there is no direct connection but varied heat exchanger this stops any leak or problem in one property affecting another normally you would leave any any existing boiler in situ to act as a backup in case of any problems with the wood chip boiler within the property it's unlikely that you'd notice anything different radiators would do the same as with any other system as would hot water tanks baths or showers there's no reason why you shouldn't use underfloor heating the only thing you are likely to notice is a dramatic reduction in your fuel bills compared with oil or lpg that you were using before after the chip has been burnt and apart from the heat that is produced there's a small residue of ash boiler will convey the ash from the grate into these ash bins by means of an auger and every two to three weeks you might have to empty the ash bins ideally onto your garden where it makes an excellent fertilizer the quantity of ash is tiny only about one percent of the wood that you put in it becomes ash you"

        "transcript": "you have never more getting one one cs so not too good computer line who actually has zero one so never mind uh initial laning stages has been pretty confident now but we'll see as these heroes get more and more levels they will become more and more aggressive okay and i think i have my frame rate fixed back to good old 30 and was dropping again i don't know why what's wrong with it today and as you said earthquake are coming to mid but not doing much due to some failed fissures and we have witch doctor just being completely annoying to burning at top and yeah he is we'll have but trax is on the lane as well so that's going to be really bad if it drags on like that as medusa will not get the farming she needs yeah definitely meanwhile uh we have a kanka against razer at bottom i'm gonna have to give this lane to razer because pearls just really know how to abuse that animation of razer whereas us lesser players seem to have quite a bit of trouble last hitting with them meanwhile it looks like we're gonna have a venge coming around we'll see if they're able to pick off the razor here razer very wisely going to be heading back art style are pretty top caliber player so he's going to head back meanwhile we have crystal maiden coming bottom to support the razor so it looks like the lanes are kind of fixed at the moment we are going to have earthshaker heading top with a dd rune and uh dave would you like to comment this part yeah it's really interesting if you look at the skill bill of the light of heaven's draw ranger picking up no level of true shot or which is completely very odd as there's a nice fisher blocking off not mania style fisher whereas isn't blocks off but it looks like dusa will be okay there is some nice harassment that wish doctor he has out for a voodoo hero instead of melodic ass there's first but happening on bot lane i hope you caught that i'm really sorry i was looking at top as you were talking about it but yes i did miss that we can see well vs killed a razor so it's a stun and a torrent and they're at it again so it's done in a torrent indeed as now this time crystal maiden goes down but look at that early static link i think that's what's called early static link on razer is gonna so he does not have a single level of aura while he's level two but still i've never seen razer get static things so early have you guys no that's pretty interesting yeah it seems like dts is redefining how to play certain heroes here such as the dro ranger which uh standard max out the true shot by seven and of course same thing with the razer getting the aura maxed out by seven as well so or maybe getting the nuke and at least at one level they were like what jack was saying but now getting none of that so i'm really interested to what what to see what you know the dts team is actually thinking i'm a bit confused yes very very interesting indeed if you noticed on top there was another nice block but for some reason well not for some reason but their lane is so powerful with drow and uh witch doctor that even when earthquaker gets the nice block or at least a decent block the two of them that being ranged heroes can just attack doosa or earthshaker and actually scare him off and and basically make counter the gank very well yeah and uh drow has been a leveling up uh stats at this point she has uh point i think two points in frost arrow and two points in stat so she doesn't i'm not sure if you picked up a silence there i'm pretty sure that's pretty interesting okay so two points and two frost arrows so it looks like they're playing very aggressively um and as they said i'm sure why they haven't gotten that true shot or yet it doesn't in terms of last hitting however i guess she does want a bit more hp just to make sure that she doesn't get picked off from the earthshakers fissure that every last bit helps yeah just like i guess a guess of why they're not actually picking up true shot over here is that maybe he doesn't want the range reap of him his range stream to push that much they really if you look at if you pay attention to the past couple minutes that creep equilibrium has been stuck on top as this wish doctor is just forcing one hero or forcing both ear shaker away looks like there it will be a perfect block this time let's see if it's going to tangle no not a perfect block never mind so they will be okay and i wish tucker is getting it the voodoo restoration at 2 is also very confusing as we have some action back and mid and top and bottom okay so actually caught that at mid if you didn't basically vs came stunned nevermoor and lion followed up with my stun and they took down sf i did not really catch that nice black at top due to watching this but now there's some action at top uh drow is actually going to try oh a nice defensive fissure that's a complete block right there helping medusa very much and now vs is coming over for the gank and a stun goes down on which doctor and as you said very interesting as he had the early voodoo but it might help him and if he does get away this time it would be because of the voodoo but he does die so restocker do you have any comments on that um yeah i'm just thinking that they really are uh kind of playing similar to how asians usually play it's reminiscent we see the dts team is planning on having a long farm game or at least that's what it seems so far as dave said earlier uh drought opting not to get the two-shot or just to maintain the creep equilibrium we see witch doctor getting voodoo restoration just gonna help that drought ranger stay in lane no matter how much harass she takes so it looks like they are planning on just letting dro farm firm up a storm here meanwhile we have never more picking up an invis rune so can you give us a quick quick uh creep check dave in terms of the creep sport yeah it looks like at the mid lane lines 25 and six so uh with the with the nevermoor 23 and four they're actually laning pretty well and this lane is gonna kind of go either way depending on if there's a quick finger for the kill or if never control the lane through raises uh back at bottom lane there's 35 crypto on the kunka versus the let's see razer has 12 only quick with 12 creep wheels of razer's completely losing bottom lane uh not too sure how kung is actually winning that lane three times as much as squeak kill meanwhile on top lane um a similar story but backwards dudes only having too creep kills compared to the draw ranger 32 creep kill so farming wise is a bit even but having the juice only a two creep hill is a bit uh disadvantage towards the ehome team so i'm not too sure how they're gonna rebound in terms of having a horrible early game and how they're going to do in the mid game yes that is actually really horrible with two creep kills on doosa as you said as and he's only level two so that is horrible as well and why when it rotates to me we always have some actions at top again going down on vs and maldik is down so he's probably going to die and drow is going to kill earthquaker as well with one last arrow there i don't know i didn't really catch most of that did any of you no i was looking at the gank on the crystal maiden um dave did you see the kill on the earth shaker yeah well it was just a standard fissure into you know nice orb walking by uh the light of heaven and i have to say life of heaven has been playing all carry this tournament and he usually plays the semi ganks on my support and it's really nice to see him back on the hard carry last time we commented on a very very uh intensive sniper game that he played and that was a pretty good game as well so yes it brings makes up reminds us of the good old days when he like actually does not appear like for 30 minutes of the whole game and comes out with like three items and owns the entire opponent team because i'm pretty sure that's what made him famous his farming so yeah i gotta comment a bit more on the mid game here because obviously home is going to be relying on kanka and and while their es and lion and such for mid game but dts has the way stronger build with razer and shadow fiend i mean and early on as medusa is doing so bad i do not know how they could manage to come back during mid game even though they are ahead in the head count of course yeah yeah i'm just going to talk about the item builds real quick"

        "transcript": "hey what's going on everybody this is bio here and this is going to be some Black Ops I am playing I am playing on launch I was about to say radiation but that's not right and I'm going to be using the FN fall which I am definitely a big fan of you see you see a lot of different commentators they'll play games where they use like crazy weapons and they'll try to use you know absurb tactics to get to get a lot of kills you know like back in Modern Warfare 2 I think I saw a couple videos that were like Claymores only or something like that um which is really funny to watch but I'm I'm not a big fan of like you know using all these crazy Styles and techniques to get a bunch of kills usually I just like to uh just to play the game use whatever gun I want to and go ahead and have that get as many kills as I can cuz that's pretty fun for me but uh every now and then I pick up the fall just because this gun even though it's you know even though you're limiting yourself by you know not using automatic weapon so you are making it I believe more difficult for yourself in that process even though that is happening the gun for me is so much more gratifying to you so much more gratifying to use you know cuz there'll be all these guys running around with their automatic weapons and here you are uh timing your shots and all that kind of stuff and making it pinpoint rate on them and you know you can't can't rely on bullet spread you can't rely on hip firing hip firing with with the FN fa no that doesn't work not unless you like raid at like jabbing range at bayonet range that'd be sick if you could attach a bayonet to gun I want that I want that now um but no so it's definitely for me it's very gratifying back back when I played Call of Duty 2 and I didn't play too much um when I played it I would always use I believe it was the kar98 unless I was on the uh allies sign I forget the gun I would use then but I'd always used the kar98 and it was a rifle it wasn't the sniper rifle sniper rifle game sniper rifle in that game was incredibly annoying just because uh there was only four on four so there was only eight players and like nearly all the time everyone would be using the sniper so you never see anybody like all right get up on this rooftop chill out wait nothing happens 5 minutes later game's almost over it's like okay okay this is kind of boring I'd be like the only guy running around I'd be using a rifle so but uh that was was kind of annoying but either way even then I was still using only rifles cuz it was just so much more gratifying I think I think back then too the kar98 was only was pretty much a one- shot kill every time unless you hit them like in the foot or something so I was definitely definitely enjoying that but yeah the the fall incredibly incredibly gratifying to use and Call of Duty for me Isn't a game where a single kill is very gratifying just cuz you know you die so fast fast and it's really easy to kill someone or as opposed to in like Halo Gears of War you know people take a little bit more effort to kill on an individual basis so you know in Halo you have like five shots with the DMR to take him down and then in Gears War you have like I don't know how many uh hammer burst shots it is probably like um 10 maybe to down someone and then obviously you know shotgun kill but that that takes uh that takes a considerable amount of aiming to get single shot with the shotgun kill and plus he put yourself in a really really bad position cuz the other person can do the same thing you but I love I love Gears of War for that aspect for that close range Close Quarters combat that is definitely a lot of fun but yes FN fall I love thee it is it is very rewarding I mean it's especially rewarding when you know you pop around the corner there's another dude right in your face and he just starts you know he just pulls the trigger he's not even an aim and just blind Fir and just hoping they get lucky and you just you know scope in and put two or three clean shots and pow pow you know take him down it's just like feels feels so good no but uh you know what I mean like you know this dude's like aiming like freaking he's got Tourette's in his hand or something you're just like what are you doing pop two or three Cen ones into them so that's always that's always very rewarding very very enjoyable a lot of people ask and now that I mention that you know I don't I don't find you know kills in Call of Duty gratifying a lot of people ask me you know bi if you don't if you don't enjoy Call of Duty that much and why you play it and the thing is I do enjoy it but I only enjoy it for certain periods you know I won't play video games or Call of Duty for a week or two and then you know I'll see a video or I'll see someone else playing the game and I'll kind of get a hanker for it like man I'm really really jonesing for cot so I'll hop on for a few hours maybe for a day or two and then after that I've kind of you know kind of filled up my bar of fun or I've kind of um depleted my bar of fun I should say and then I stop playing you know I only to do something that's enjoyable and Call of Duty is just one of the things where you know after a while I get a hankering for it I play it kind of fulfill that and then I go do something else so this is one of those games where I can't really play over and over again and and so yeah um Halo Halo used to be that way where I could just keep playing over and over not so much right now is just Gears of War but unfortunately the beta ended just ended today actually so that is going to be a bummer I'm going to have to find some other game or some other activity to take up my time time is um no I won't I won't put you guys through that but uh so I'm definitely going to have to find something else something else to do but that is going to be it for this game guys final score team wise is 10,000 to 3900 my score is going to be 32 kills and three deaths hope you guys enjoyed the video enjoyed the gun usage and yeah I will see you guys later thank you for watching I do appreciate it"

        "transcript": "oh hey guys it's Andre here and today we're going to be unboxing the beats by dre mixers from David Guetta I got these like two three days ago there is supposed to be a plastic wrap that is going to be around it basically but I took that off and I already kind of unboxed it myself because I was pretty excited and I've never owned a pair of Beats so yeah I've used them once but I just want to go ahead and go to the process to see what you'll get and what's gonna happen or not what's gonna happen you'll have to figure that out by yourself so right now I'm just going to go ahead and open the box it's you'll have a little flap here that hangs when you buy them a quick thing to tell you if you buy a real pair but you think it's real and you buy it from like a seller that's not supposed that's not like the original seller which is Best Buy which they are like the trusted seller of beats by dre then it'll have a like a kind of like an oval type thing right here so while it hangs so you'll know that it's that that's one real thing about it they don't have like a whole thing and then it's just the normal plastic wrap this is what it kind of goes around the box here is a part of the mixer as you can see like that it's like a 3d thing and then here's the back it gives you like the information about the beats and then down here it tells you what your on the box is the case the little I don't know it's a it's a jack for like for like like when you plug into a guitar or piano and stuff like that and the actual cord they do have it in Spanish - and some other some other languages and French and then here's David Guetta there's just like all the French and Spanish and stuff and it works on iPods and iPhone and it's usually just made for you know blackberry and iPhone and iPod like it says right here on these two you see right there it says HTC and iPod and iPhone and it kind of gives you a little more information right here and then here's the cover again so let's just go ahead and actually unbox these babies what is this all right so it slides up so you're gonna do that and here's a the box that it comes with and here's the actual beats by dre like what since like the little box that it comes in and then there's a little flap that's going to be right here that's a magnetized flap and you're just going to go ahead and open it like this and here you have the the beats in the case and here's a little like information guide typing we're gonna go and move that over here you have a like a happening lady I don't know why it just kind of gives you information about beats and what beats has and they're like stock since they're not a part of monster anymore they they have their own company you'll get your user guide you'll get a one two information and this and you'll also get a beat sticker but it's on my laptop right now so I can't take it off I'll show you guys you also get a beats cleaning cloth here it feels really nice and you could just clean your beats with them what kind of set all this aside right here to the side here is your two cords that you get this is a like a kind of like a string D chord so while if you need like some freedom or something it'll kind of stretch and you won't like yeah bill you'll feel it if you drop something or something but this is mostly using like studios and stuff but you can use the other core to it this is just like an extra cord that you'll get this is the normal cord that you'll get it comes with the remote and mic that you'll use to to pause and play and go up or your volume up and down here you'll see your mic is back here on the back right here with the beats logo right there you get here's our two cords and then it comes with the little thing I was talking about what you could just plug in right here you just set an adapter so you just plug it in it snaps in and there you go it works just put all this back so that's all the components that really come with it now let's go on to the actual headphones excuse me right there let's go ahead and unbox see so this is like a like a hard tight case it's like a cotton not really cotton it feels really uh like rough and then it has a little red lining here on the side for the zipper there's the beach logo I used to say monster or monster here but as I said they're not a part of monster anymore they're their own company and here you have a little beats logo on your own zipper so let's go ahead and open this so as you open it the headphones will be revealed inside as you see here the white mixers the inside is like a really soft feel pretty soft so you won't damage your beat so here's like where you can carry your wires or whatever you need to carry around with your case so let's go ahead and take out the beats set this aside and here we have the beats mixr's and white these are the 2013 version because they're not a part of Monster so they won't have the monster logo right here and they won't they're just there there's Beats now by their own company so here we have the beats it has the swivel feature it's a you can go 100 and something 120 degrees I think it says in the booklet but a constant 90 degrees here and then it can go 90 degrees this way but then this is how you basically just carry it like it came in the case and there's the 90 degree feature and basically it just goes in and swivels so you can actually carry it it's made for DJ's mostly but you can buy them to use them like I just I bought them because they're really good headphones I think they're my opinion I like them better than the studios the studios are pretty good too hopefully I'll be getting those soon to show you guys like comparisons and stuff like that for beats so here we have the beats mixr's I've tried them on they sound pretty good they're actually pretty comfy they had these uh these comfy padding's and here you have the beats by dre probably can't see that because my camera is not focusing but it says beats by dre right there and that also says beats by dre right here here you have the wire that that goes in through here and it tells you what is left and what right so there we have right and here we have the wire that kind of goes out and it has a this this cool like like this cool thing to like adjust your head it'll fit on really big head so if you have a big head don't worry they also
