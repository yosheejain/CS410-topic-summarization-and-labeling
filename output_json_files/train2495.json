        "transcript": "hello everyone my name is Cliff and today I want to talk to you about this new device that I got called the iotti easy OneTouch car mount now this car mount is designed for the iPhone 5 the 5S the 4 the 4S and the Galaxy S4 um it also fits smartphones with widths up from 2 to 3 in if it's smaller than 2 in it's going to be too small so if your device is between 2 and 3 in it'll fit here pretty good now I should note that I did try to put my my actual GPS into this thing and um by my actual GPS I mean my TomTom GPS and it was too big so um that's just uh it wasn't too big by too much but it was still too big so that's something that you need to take into consideration this thing is flexible but it's only flexible up to a certain amount now the main reason why I want to make this video was because I looked all over YouTube for drive test videos before I got this thing because I was CU I was curious to see if the shake would be bad or not I knew the suction on this thing is good this thing has Ultra sticky suction pad that's what the box says um reusable Innovative Ultra sticky suction pad will uh will stick to any glass surface as well as any non-curved dashboard I tried this thing on my dashboard as well as my windshield and it sticks it's got a Superman likee grip I'll put that way what you're seeing in this video is video that I filmed primarily on my iPhone 5S the the 1080p camera on my iPhone 5s and then I also tried some test with um my Canon camera my Canon elf camera so one of them the Canon camera has better shck compensation built in naturally to it so that's why you're probably going to see less Shake whereas the iPhone doesn't have that great Shake compensation on it so that's why you know I want to try it on both just to see how the different tests would come out so this is how the audio sounds with the way I have it right now the way I have it right now the clamps are actually covering up the speakers so that's probably why the audio is not too good right now I've got to figure out how to work around maybe maybe if I spend around the other way uh it kind of works sort of kind of but then I run into other issues so I'm still triing around with it and seeing what's going to work out and what's not maybe there's a reason why I haven't seen many drive test videos on YouTube I don't know maybe they're out there but I cannot find them very easily so I want to made my own for anybody else who's thinking about buying this thing so you can see how well this does I will say now that all footage that you're watching in this video has not been altered there's been no shake compensation effects added to it there's been no stabilization added to this this is all raw footage and in the event that I do decide to stabilize anything in editing I will have it clearly marked in the video so you can see the difference side by side obviously the camera that has built-in image stabilization is going to perform better that's just kind of a given but I wanted to see how much better it would perform than my iPhone 5S does in this video I only use the 1080p camera on the iPhone 5S I did not bother with the 720p camera because I tried it before and it had noticeable Shake on it but if anything the 1080p camera is going to have better IM stabilization built into it so that's why I just went with that one even though I don't think they're that much different so like I said that's why I try to use that one and then compare it with the cannon to see what the actual difference would be and you can make that judgment for yourself to get these shots I attached the car mount to both the windshield and to the dashboard just to see if there will be any difference because when I first attached it I did it to the car um I I did to the dashboard of the car and then later on I did it to the windshield and from my results I think the windshield gets slightly better results I could be wrong maybe that's just me but that seems to be my general results now let's take a look at some of the features of the car mount itself so right here we can see the sticky stuff which is very in it's incredibly strong it's basically like Superman gripping your dashboard or your window or wherever um and then you have this little Notch right here which controls the bend and flexibility of this point right here let me see if I can actually use this one-handed if I unscrew this a little bit then it creates a Bend point right there I'm going straighten to tighten it back up because if I don't then it's going to be getting on my nerves then you have a second Bend point right here so if I twist this this way then you can maneuver this piece right here in various ways and then basically what you do is you get your phone or whatever it is you press it again you press it against this Dot and whoops that was a horrible example let me try it again that's exactly what happens right there now this is not big enough to fit my actual GPS it's to fit my phone it's B enough to fit the camera that I'm filming this on right now although these pieces right here do tend to cover up my mics so sometimes I have tried to spin spin it around and do it this way this this typically frees up the mics but then this right here is pressing down on the picture button so I have to make sure that I record before I put it on here I'm still experimenting with that haven't done too many tests with that but that's basically how this thing operates overall so um and just to show you how difficult this thing is to pull up some of you may have already seen other videos but it has a latch back in the back which I'm probably have to spin around has a latch back here you pull this up man and as you can see already how much of a difference that makes and then I'm not sure if I going to be able to do to this one handed or not but I'm going to try then you have to this is not easy to do one handed there he goes so that's how much of a grip this thing has super suction cup man that's blurry I don't know if it'll focus or not but yeah super suction cup um there it goes Super suction cup uh made in Korea and I think that this thing is so strong that they've actually put a patent on this thing on this one specifically so it's very strong that's essentially has a this essentially how the thing works so if you're thinking about getting one this video should give you a pretty good overall idea if it's right for you also one last thing that I would like to mention is that this piece right here actually slides off this is essentially how this works this piece this piece right right here you have to grab this you have to grip this middle part right here and then you have to push down on this and then it clicks and then you just pull off and as you can see this piece right here has these notches in it that match up to these notches right here so it's just a matter hooking them in there sliding them up and then you know sliding them back down when you want to disconnect thanks for watching I don't typically do reviews but I figured I would try it and give it a shot anyway so if you like to see more of this kind of video feel free to let me know and I will see you next time [Music]"

        "transcript": "hey guys it's no butter and I've got another battle for three video here for you guys and in this video I thought I'd talk about red shows him you shall you get some gameplay from a different class the nice all class and I've been doing a lot with the ESL class since the patch was released a few weeks ago and so I thought I'd try to change it up a little bit more and show you guys some gameplay from some different classes and so in this video I wanted to talk about what's become insane probably my favorite class setup to use in the engineer class and that is a zero as you'll see throughout this game play that's the m4a1 and the attachments i'm using our the foregrip and flash suppressor and then later you'll see how i have a red dot sight equipped for the scope and so I thought I'd talk a little bit about this setup and you know first of luck with the m4a1 I think the game for a one of was you know it was pretty good before the patch so I don't really know if it's a statistics change at all really um post patch just because you know it was a pretty solid woman before and it's definitely just as good now if not better and I think with the setup that i'm using it really accentuates accentuates its positives and you know i think this kind of probably the aks-74u are from what I've seen the the best to engineer weapons to use the best to carbines or SMG is to use for the engineer class and so you know i think they said it would probably work with either one the one thing that i do like a little bit about the m4a1 as opposed to the aks-74u is that the m4a1 has a bit of a faster fire rate so it's going to be a little bit better at close ranges which I do like for the engineer weapons I kind of think of engineer weapons as more of a close range or the engineer classes are more of a close-range kit at least when you're taking on infantry and that's where most of the guns excel and so I kind of geared this set up towards the we're with that in mind and so that's why I've got the forum and flash suppressor on because the flash suppressor decreases recoil and I know a lot of people do like to use the heavy barrel on these engineer weapons but are in order to give them the store that added range on the weapon but I kind of prefer the flash suppressor just be it it really just makes this gun extremely good at you know medium to close ranges and as well see over the course of this video I i can take guys out pretty quickly with this setup and I like to use the foregrip because it reduces a little bit of the recoil it doesn't increase the bullet spread I think a little bit but I don't think it's that noticeable and you know it's not like you really have any better options I think you could just leave the leave this the attachments lot empty or the item slot open but you know I think the foregrip is probably good to have there and it just kind of filled up this class I think nicely so here you'll see I can i really just you know these close quarters situations as gun is really really good and whereas in the long-range encounters it's it's not going to work as well but I find that for the most part that's not going to be a big deal when you're using the engineer class just because you know when I use the engineer class I tend to play as if I tend to play you know more close to the enemy and most of the encounters are the engagements that I get into our are going to be close range so I I sort of set this class up to take advantage of that so does it depend a little bit on the places I'll that you use but i think that at least for the way I you like to play the engineer class you know if I'm not going to be focusing heavily on the vehicles and this is a really good anti-infantry set up as well and one other thing I wanted to mention about using the flash suppressor especially also over the the laser sight because that's another option especially for close-range situations I mean you can kind of tell already the hipfire for this weapon is pretty good already and you know mate with the laser sight that would just probably make it ridiculous I haven't even tried it out but you know my guess is that would be pretty effective as well but it's not really necessary i think it just because that you can already tell the crosshairs are pretty small anyways when im hit firing and i think it works pretty well so i like the flash suppressor more just because it does give you that reduced recoil as well which you know I think that's always helpful and it's it's definitely a worthwhile attachment to you that I I think in general what I found host patches that either the flash suppressor or the heavy barrel is your best is the best way to go for that third attachment slot and I still like to use the foregrip I'd say for the most part and the the exception of the underslung rail I do like to use that from time to time as I've talked about with the with my favorite class setup that I talked about earlier with the m416 but for the most part I think you know the combination of for grip and heavy barrel or for grip and flash suppressor is going to be you know really effective for the most part end it's a probably the best way to go if you want to reduce recoil and with a gun like the m4a1 which i think is already sort of geared more towards those medium to close-range situations you know using this setup when this gun is going to be extremely effective I think as you guys really see over the course of this gameplay it's a it's definitely a set of that you can't really go wrong with and I mean it's really a gun that you can't go wrong with to its it's probably I'd say one of if not the best the engineer weapons that out there and like I mentioned earlier one other thing I want to just quickly mention about this class setup is the pistol that I use in a you know I'm not sure if I you really seem use it at all in this video or if I even have any quick foot what i found i think is really the best pistol use at least you know I I kind of I've talked a little bit as before but I like to usually balance my pistol with the weapon that i'm using so if i'm using a long-range weapon that and i want to use a pistol that's going to be really good at close ranges so you know for example with a sniper rifle which is really good at long ranges i generally want to use a pistol that can do really well at Short ranges so something like the g18 or the GGN suppressed or you know even the magnum or the rex which are both you know pretty good close range weapons azure close range pistols as well and so for this class setup i would probably recommend using something that has a little more range to it just because into the m4a1 is it's already other setups already pretty good at it closer ranges I mean it's pretty good at all ranges with the exception of maybe really long ranges so I probably say you know either the the wrecks of the Magnum is a good pistol use with a setup but you could also use something like the m9 I think that's a good pistol as well to use but you know I wouldn't use something like the g18 because I just think it's unnecessary and kind of redundant and so you know when you're when you're going for a really good class setup but generally speaking what I'd like to do is I try to sort of balance things out so that I can you know get the most out of out of all the weapons that I have two are the out of all the options that I have to choose from and to try to create the most balanced to possible set up so that I can you engage targets at at all ranges but anyways that's just about all I wanted to talk about in this video regarding this class setup I hope you guys enjoyed this this gameplay and just kind of this short little commentary i haven't actually it's been a little while since I've done a commentary so you know i'll try to post their host these a little more often i have the last couple weeks I've been a little busier so I'll try to get back into the habit of posting these little more regular and you know now that the patch has been out i'll probably settle back into doing some of these other other videos that I've that I was doing before the patch and I I did have a another series that I wanted to start that I kind of had to postpone because of the patch and I want to do some other stuff right after the patch was released but I now that it's been a few weeks I think I'll probably just go back to the other plane that I had beforehand so anyways thanks for watching this video guys hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you"

        "transcript": "hello and welcome everyone this is type v3 and let's get straight to the point what we have before us is the super robot chogokin drill set of Manliness an add-on accessory set for the Gurren Lagann figure of the same line or for any other SRC who also carries the crossover joint feature opening up the box you are greeted with a massive amount of drills breaking down the contents you get a static and spinning version of the kicker drills an armed emplacement a replaceable head crest and 28 smaller drills two of which are slightly different from the rest starting with the Giga drills you have two options when it comes to having Gurren Lagann wield them the first of which involves removing his fist and then popping on this static drill now I found that the increased weight is a little too much for the joints of the arm to handle but thankfully there is a peg hole in the drill to support the use of Potamus she staged the other option is to simply remove the forearm altogether and replace it with the included drill wielding accessory this gets rid of all the weight issues but at the same time you do lose the articulation from the elbow joint getting Gurren Lagann to wield the spinning giga drill is also an easy affair you basically just slide it over the static drill and lock it in place now I will admit that no matter which method of attachment you're using for the arm all this plastic is rather heavy and you will need to use a tamashii stage also the much more acute viewers probably have already deduced that since this spinning drill is essentially a slip on effect part you can't have GL wield both accessories at the same time unless of course you use clever camera angles and multiple display stands the rest of this set deals with getting Gurren Lagann into his fold relized mode it's fairly straightforward as all you have to do is replace the head crest and plug all the drills in every peg hole on the figure of course there are certain things to take note of before you start firstly you'll need to use the original four wrist drills that came with GL next you'll notice that two of the drills are slightly thinner and are made of a harder plastic these plug into Gurren Lagann shoulders as for the 26 other more rubbery drills well you just apply them where you can as a side note if you're using the Guren winged backpack you will have for drills left over when you're done you've got Gurren Lagann in his fold relized mode i think it looks absolutely great the connections are solid in the articulate isn't hindered in any way although the drills do tend to collide sometimes and that makes posing him slightly more frustrating but it's not detrimental to the release all in all this is an interesting add-on set and I have some mixed thoughts on it paint finish and build quality are certainly top-notch but I wish there was a little more substance to its offerings moreover I just hope that the Giga drills were much larger or if not that then maybe even the inclusion of longer and more narrow drills would have been a nice touch to ultimately I feel as if the entire set should have just been included with the original release and not its own separate thing most add-on sets are used to represent upgrades given to a character later on in their fiction and as such are never really considered to be must-haves for every collector the drill set of Manliness is quite the opposite of that approach it's entirely integral to the full enjoyment of the super robot chogokin Gurren Lagann and when you couple that with the fact that this set retails for about two thousand yen you do feel a slight sense of price gouging going on so what's my advice just buy it sure you won't like the fact that it costs about $10 more than it should and the finnick in this and size of the Giga drills may disappoint you depending on expectations but if you don't buy it now you'll surely regret it later because if you don't one day you'll come across another src Gurren Lagann folder lies mode engaged Giga drill equipped and you'll only have a deep feeling of emptiness and we wouldn't want that now would we anyways this has been type v3 and thanks for watching this review but what if I told you that there's an alternate drill set on the horizon one that's not fueled by manliness or courage but rather darkness and anti spiral technology"

        "transcript": "[Music] over the years the Star Wars movies as well as the expanded universe have introduced us to a multitude of Jedi but unfortunately some of those Jedi while awesome just don't get the exposure they really deserve with that said I'm counting down the top 10 most underrated Jedi number 10 Jedi Master Das Jenner a survivor of Order 66 Das Jenner was a main protagonist in the dark times series or at least the first two volumes he had a very interesting personality about him although he could sometimes be very in tune with the force he was also Brash and was one of the few Jedi who didn't hesitate on using a gun you could really see a character shift with him as he tries to adapt to the new Empire age unfortunately this character was cut off after the second volume when the series focused on other characters it's really a shame too because this character really did have a lot of depth to him he has been introduced recently back into the series and let's honestly hope he gets more exposure daser a great character cut off before his time but hopefully coming back number nine shakun no that's not a Mis mispronunciation I'm talking shakun not plun shakun is PL kun's niece who previously appeared in the series The Stark hyperspace War although she really didn't get a chance to shine until the one- shot Purge where we learn her ultimate fate becoming a Jedi Knight she she was a Avid studier and and very in tune with her telepathic abilities having survived the raain on the temple shakun attempted to put the Empire down by attacking Lord Vader himself she put up a good fight but was ultimately destroyed by the dark lord her telepathic abilities made her a very unique character when she first appeared I honestly thought she was a really interesting character and I did hope to see more although I had to wait so long to see her again it was good to see her in action for once shakun the niece of plun who just never got the exposure she deserved number eight Ty vako tyo was a member of the Jedi High Council long before episode 1 came out and was a key leader in the Stark hyperspace War series unfortunately he was cut down quite early in the series and only even got one fight scene it was a shame too because like many W wook Jedi he really exhibited a lot of strength and a lot of knowledge his death really should have been saved for the very end of the series even his last words really reflect something about how a series would end with a curved tilted wooden yellow lightsaber this is one wook you do not want to piss off now number seven and six Fon dun and auroran kbba now you may be asking yourself who are these two well these two Jedi were the ones who confronted Grievous during the Clone Wars 2003 series these two Jedi are severely underrated because of how little exposure they got but they were both really good characters and they even did get some backstory further down the line they were able to hold off Grievous for a good time and even got some very good impressive fight scenes Unfortunately they weren't able to stand up against Grievous and they really were cut down before their time Iran even got a lot more further backstory down the line we learned about who his Apprentice was who his master was and even a little bit about him before the tragic attack on corusant two Jedi who confronted Grievous and just didn't get any exposure after that number five UD berar one of the few nii Jedi UD berar lived in lived over 5,000 years before the Battle of Yavin and even even continued to live long after that his intellect in his cunning really made him a very interesting Jedi he had a really big wave of mysterious about him he didn't do too much but that only made him more interesting it's a shame that this character didn't get too much exposure but think about this guys he was one of the few Jedi who actually was able to beat xaron what does that tell you about him unfortunately his bondage to ois really made really cut his character down severely he didn't come back again until the dark Empire series UD benar teacher historian underrated number four Maat one of the main stars of the Jedi Council acts of War series mam Gat was a Jedi master who served on the Jedi Council and was on the council right before the Battle of nabo MOT really had a really cool personality about him he was very comical and was very sure of himself he wielded two yellow lightsabers which both had very unique features he really did seem like a character who had gone through a very interesting Road through his life I really would have liked to have seen this guy explored a lot more he had such a great personality about him and he really did seem like a leader unfortunately he was killed towards the end of the series but he did go out in a very impressive way although this guy has has made another appearance he he only just meets the requirements for getting on this list makat cool Jedi Master but just not cool enough number three I'm going die it really is a shame when a Jedi master's name pretty much tells you his ultimate fate I'm going to die was designed for one episode of the Clone Wars TV series in which he defended rof but this guy really is an awesome Jedi he was a skill leader and you could really tell he cared for the people of riyo I really would like to have seen this guy get exposed a lot more in future episodes or at least show what his life was like beforehand not to mention he went out in one of the best final fights in the Clone War Series going up by himself against a whole Army of battle droids although he was unfortunately cut down at the end the people of Goff will always remember him I'm going to die your fate may have been already written down before you made it on screen but you sure didn't go out like a wimp number two qron okay why wasn't this guy in the movie qron was a Jedi master who survived Order 66 and the great Jedi Purge he was a very skilled Warrior and even was able to take on the dark Jedi jerck in the video game series Jedi Knight following the adventures of kar he was unfortunately killed by Jerick but but he did live on as a force Spirit which of course makes him awesome qwan's backstory is very in-depth and very well written honestly this guy really does deserve his own series with a gold lightsaber and a wicked fighting style Kon really does deserve more than he ever got and finally number one hellad ventor now you have to be really a hardcore Star Wars fan to know who hellad ventor is he wasn't in the movies and he wasn't in any of the comic books but he actually originated in an adventure game Star Wars domain of evil but helan ventor gets number one on this list for his amazing backstory and his amazing achievements even in that Adventure game helan ventor was a Jedi Knight through the Clone Wars and who desired more than anything to be a hero his very complex and very in-depth backstory it's actually quite similar to how Anakin became a Jedi KN his great military leadership even won him one of the highest Republic honors in history unfortunately though helg ventor's crippling Pride did lead to his downfall for a time he did survive Order 66 but during the Great Jedi Purge he was captured by Darth Vader and was tortured to try and reveal the locations of other Jedi unfortunately Vader broke him and he revealed the location of other Jedi which unfortunately meant those Jedi were killed heled was so guilty that when he escaped Vader's clutches he escaped and went into Exile and even got entangled in the dark side of the force hellad ultimately though was redeemed when the group of rebels came to his swamp planet and helped him see the light helan ventor died on that planet but then transcended the physical plane and lived on as a force Spirit hug adventure story really shows how Jedi don't try and become Heroes on their own and accept what is given to them by the force his story really is a good path to Redemption and I do highly recommend anybody to check it out hellad ventor one of the best Jedi ever and most people don't even know it well guys I hope you enjoyed the list if you have any underrated Jedi you like that I didn't mention please feel free to share them in the comments hope you guys enjoyed the video and I'll see you guys [Music] later"

        "transcript": "and and also I think this whole exercise that we've gone through now with this one chord and trying to rearrange the notes trying to find the inversions trying to think of how we can use it as all these other chords it's really basically how I trap try to practice whatever I do you know whether it's harmony or rhythm or what-have-you basically the method for me it's always to try and kind of wood lit down to something really small and really specific so that I know exactly what I'm working on and and by doing that for me it's it's much easier to to really really get the full sense of what I can get from that one little thing so you know for me you know a major nine chord I can I can be practicing that for four weeks four months you know and and once I'm done with the inversion of that you know I can now rearrange the notes and and and and and now the inversions are gonna be different you know everything's gonna be different even though it's the same exact set of notes so you know this this kind of stuff can keep you go on forever and even I think one of the main things is also to try and just do it every time you practice just spend a little bit of time on it even if it's five minutes you know by doing it on a constant basis it's it's like your ears start to acclimate and and and even when you're not when you don't physically have the guitar in your hands you're still sort of thinking about the ways of using it in the back of your mind another thing to try and keep in mind is to kind of keep keep going back to it you know like if you spend some time on this every time you practice even if it's just for five minutes of whatever practice time you have that's really gonna help in having you have you ear there's a clown rise to this sound and also also you know you it'll be like something that you're constantly thinking about even even if you don't physically have the guitar you know in your hands you're practicing even if you're just walking around you're still kind of thinking of these quarter relationships and in the back of your head so that's just as far as general practicing thoughts those those are two big things for me just trying to make it very small very specific and and and having it be sort of a constant thing that that you work on until it naturally becomes a part of your playing so what you really want to do is to try and get you know you sort of collect more and more of these so that the way the way you choose to to express the Harmony the types of chords and the anabolic structures really you know have a big effect on the way that how many feels and the sound of the the whole thing and and and so you know you're really sort of specific with the kind of character you give a tune or when you're accompanying someone you try to really be complimentary you know with with your voicings and in terms of how you think it sort of hooks up with their vocabulary and and their playing so I'm going to do one more of these just a bit you know quicker this time but I'm going to show you another way of kind of approaching these chords you"

        "transcript": "what's up guys and welcome back to another LittleBigPlanet torn minecraft video I should say a Minecraft PE is where video we're gonna be showing off the skin back for the LittleBigPlanet mashup act it's actually a really cool one so let's just get right into it check them on you can go to the health and options and then do change skin if we go all the way over to the LittleBigPlanet pack we can see all the wonderful skin so we're just gonna go down each one and check each one out first of course we have the class exact boy and I actually like it a lot because you can see the zipper is 3d and to get AMA sackboy Steve so basically sack we all dressed up like the wonderful Steve from minecraft pen if you get some really um well-known costume for sack well you have the Marvin Disco Dancer you have the rock sack early let me spin him around really quick I always love this guy this one was always one of my favorites I remember he was one of the first sack boy costumes I knew about when I first started playing it'll be planet you know before I actually started playing the game and stuff and then there's a rock sack girl and she looks pretty cool I like her pigtails and stuff as all said the groom Zach boy he has a wonderful top hat and then we also have the bride sacral of course both the groom sack boy in the brown Sakura from LittleBigPlanet one the groom and bride area basically I think it's the second area of the game we also have the fairy sack girl which uh camera moving this one's from LittleBigPlanet - I can't remember if this one's actually anything specific or if it's just some type of costume of course the Ninja Sackboy because it looks wonderfully awesome and then a Yukiko schoolgirl which is yet another costume this one looks pretty interesting does I'll go get schoolgirl and then I love this one so much because it brings me back this is a dragon sack boy I remember seeing somebody with this head in Little Big Planet into thinking oh man I totally have to get this game now this one's really cool to me and then this one is the devil sack boy which is actually pretty interesting I haven't actually seen a devil costume in Little Big Planet at least not an official one so maybe I've missed something they're not sure and then the dinosaur sack girl this one is so cute I love this one so much with the eyes and everything and this one is the neon Sakura this one's very a little bit pon a to ask mixes and tweaks the barely looks like a sack boy or a sad girl but at the same time I can see the inspiration Millian sack boy book is a zebra sackboy my nemesis here has a sack boy but I don't that's okay I have one in LittleBigPlanet we also have one in the battle and beast pack I think it is but here's the sack bot costume there's one of course was introduced in one big planet to the zachbots so it's cool to see them here and to see all the costumes and stuff from all little planet games the king it of course a famous famous NPC from a little be pond at one and then his wonderful wife the Queen I like the feathers on her back she just looks so majestic then we have a slew of different LittleBigPlanet one characters starting with the great magician that was in one of the later areas with the elephant and stuff the Z dude of course ninja afro man he was actually a bad guy I believe we also have sheriff Zapata once again another bad guy and he of course played in the horrible boomtown then we have a terrible Oni now this guy was actually a really cool boss fight too I love his look here this actually might be one of my favorite costumes in the pack just because one of my favorite skins just because of his big blog map he just looks so angry of course the shopkeeper once again in the same area with the elephant I do believe but there we go so beautiful isn't it and this one's really cool this is Marianne noisette and this one doesn't seem familiar to you that's because this one's actually a little big planet beetle one and I believe it might be the only little big planet Vita costume that we have in the entire pack I would love to see more little b-pawn a few the skins but hey one is enough and Marianne noisette is of course a really nice pic I love her spring arms then we have a Doria von bathysphere of course another main character from literally planet - she looks really cool I like her little stick arms askew and then this one might be my number one for the entire pack it is a glide hand fourth costume of course LittleBigPlanet - one of the funnest and just most interesting characters out of all of LittleBigPlanet and then we also have Avalon centrifuge with his wonderful head set his weird goggle goggle glasses and of course his balding balding head then we have Eva Silva Perigord she can always have a hard time pronouncing this one but they even got our figure pretty correct here with the slim waist line she does look a little interesting because of course her head is way bigger and a little bit planet - but still looks pretty cool and then we got the little big pond of free stuff first off we have good version of Newton am i some different is that he has an orange head here sort of looks a little more yellowish then but maybe that's my mild colorblindness who knows but of course he looks pretty cool he looks nice and happy once again I would love to see his head bigger but of course that doesn't have it but they do have the Cape which is really darn cool all right and then we had everybody's favorite Marvin random did you know he can scamper applause I love his hair so much he has at Elvis style it actually does have a good like caption ascared then we have Captain PUD spoiler alert Newton's dad he looks pretty cool he doesn't have too much emotion to him but still overall really cool very vibrant costume then we have papal mache I love how he's sort of short of course because he's supposed to be sort of like little Toggl but I love how he's is sort of like he's sort of just like a pair of legs with hands and he looks really cool but either way let's go over it's pinky buff looms now she was the main character for the final area of course a lot of people found her annoying because of her screeching voice what I actually thought they're pretty endearing pretty cute and yeah here she is with her flower flowering goodness I would say that her flowers aren't as detailed but they still pretty cool and then we have Nana PUD of course Newton's mother once again spoiler alert and her drooping eyes I actually got the drooping eyes pretty well everything else is pretty standard though so either way it's still pretty decent interesting looking costume and then we have zoom zoom of course the shopkeeper belittle big planet 3 where we can buy all of our wonderful beautiful costumes it looks pretty interesting here I don't know how similar he really is to zoom zoom in little B pawn at 3 but I don't know it's still it's cool down and then we have two stars we have a little toggle or small toggle and he looks so sad for some reason I'm not really sure why I guess he's just sort of a little bit of a grump and then we also have big toggle it would be cool they could have made big toggle a little wider but besides I he's actually really cool his head is a really interesting shaped like I don't know some of these guys are really weird-looking but I would have liked to see him like thicker and wider and stuff I think that would make him more remnant or you know similar to toggle but either way they're still both really cool to have small toggle and big toggle and then we have evil Newton and you can see he has the purple face in the angry looking or I'm gonna beat you up and call you mean names and once again everything else about the costume is is the same besides en't he has his nice cape and then we have the sack girl finally and the sec girl looks awesome with the bandana and the hair overall a fantastic character pack I have to say that's really awesome there are so many different costumes from across all the LittleBigPlanet games like I said it wasn't cool to see more LittleBigPlanet Vita stuff but at the same time I'm very happy with everything now we got here so many new awesome characters to play as but I want to know which character do you guys like the most out of all of these which one were your most impressed by and like looks most similar to what it does in the game and although I thank you guys so much for watching there'll be more episodes of me playing through all the other levels there's already a video two videos of me playing skate to victory and boom down I'll be playing through all the other levels as well so if you want to go check those out I would really appreciate but either way guys so much for watching if you enjoyed this episode make sure to give it a like and share with your friends and family I'd comment at the comment section below I'll see you guys next time bye bye"

this really really well so if you have this t-shirt with the bunny rabbit on it from Airy then uh it's going to match this really really well see if I can show it if it actually pick up color H not really but it's basically the same color it looks really flattering with this color and I have several shirts I have probably three of these shirs in a sweater that all have this kind of like mauvey taupey purpley color I don't know it's really confusing what color it is I probably should look up I think it's mocha is what I think the color is online but it has this plumy a mauvey mauve color I don't know so anyway I'm loving this I think it's great it's a matte color I believe yeah it's a matte it's just a gorgeous color I think it's great for uh like if you're looking for a nude color that's not so nude you just want like a hint of color this is perfect if you're not a big makeup gal um I don't know why you're watching why you're watching this video If you're not a big makeup girl um but this is great for maybe you're not allowed to wear a lot of makeup your parents maybe don't allow you to wear a lot of makeup try this color cuz I think this may be a really nice col color I think it'd be great on both light skin and dark skin it's just really really pretty okay let's see next thing uh is the Kat Von D palette that I just purchased it's the Angelus palette it's this one oh it's so pretty and I'm loving it I you all know this you all have seen the uh tutorial and I'm loving every bit of it right now I'm going to do another tutorial maybe two hopefully uh this month I'm hoping okay uh let's see next we'll do we'll stick with eyes I'm loving the Urban Decay 24/7 in zero loving it um I still think I love the smolder better but I really need to pull out the smolder by Mac and this out and maybe do a a comparison for a day and see which one works better so I really like the way it kind of Glides on really nice and smooth and yeah so far I'm liking it or loving it this month let's see next for blush I've been using this palette again this palette is a Christmas palette from year before last I believe and let's see uh this the color from uh the it's a blush it's just the orgasm you all I've seen it it's popular I think it's one of the number one rated most popular blushes out there and this palette is so bad right now cuz I made a mess of it but it's the it's that one right there and uh you've probably all seen it it's got this nice little uh peachy color I've got my hand dirty too nice peachy color but it has a lot of nice Sheen to it it's kind of peach with like an orangey Sheen or a pink with an orangey tone to it really really pretty and flattering I think um I'm wearing it today and I do tend to have to use a lot of it but I'm still loving it I think it's a great color especially with the tan I just I love it loving it okay let's see next is a lip product of course the Kat Von D the uh believe it's Coral Castle yeah Coral Castle loving it wearing it now I didn't think I was going to love it after the first time I put it on but I'm loving it I really am I think it's a great alternative to nude uh cuz it's got like just just peachy color to it it's unusual and I think it looks great with the tan looks great with peach eyes Shadow or Peach blush just beautiful I love it and let's see a make a skin care product that I'm loving this month is the origins uh gin sing refreshing eye cream just loving it I think it really brightens under my eyes it's a great day um eye cream loving it all right I haven't not found a good nighttime cream that I'm loving right now so uh send some recommendations what you all like for nighttime definitely okay and let's see hair product I'm loving the um Infinity Conair the first time I pulled this out I didn't like it I hated it and I put it back in a uh back my drawer and I didn't even look at it for months I mean I've had this for several months pulled it back out and I think I'm really loving it now so yeah I think I'm loving it oh I'll probably do a tutorial it's a lot cheaper than some of the other brands but it does the trick it seems to be easier to find you don't have to order order it online you can get it like CVS so so far I'm loving it this month and let's see one kind of like iffy of the month I won't say regret cuz I I've only used it maybe twice it's the uh the eyes Shadow Brush by Sephora it's in the professional line it's the number 23 not sure if I'm loving it just seems like it's too small too stiff and too small I mean it's still still soft but when I go and brush it in there it just seems like it doesn't do what I want it to do I want it to kind of fan out a little bit more maybe if I use it a little bit longer it will it'll do what I want it to do but I'm kind of really wanting it to kind of blend in the creases and stuff but so far it's kind of like a not quite sure if I like it or not maybe a regret next month you never know so yeah hopefully you all enjoyed this video and look for a nail polish video coming up probably next day or two and I will see you all later bye"

        "transcript": "hey guys this is andrew from joycon.com and i'm taking a look at the big boy the brand new phone that everyone's going to be talking about for the rest of the summer the samsung galaxy s3 now as the three implies this is the third edition of samsung's flagship android phone oh and i'm knocking it off the stand already but that's okay because this is a tough phone it's got a corning gorilla glass 2 on the front so it's reinforced glass the back is admittedly plasticky you know it's got that typical samsung plastic feel so it's not going to feel premium or top of the line in in terms of build material but it will be durable because we've seen samsung's plastic stand up over in the past on the side you got this little uh curved lines that trick your eye into making it seem slimmer just like the galaxy nexus has on the front unlike the galaxy nexus you actually have a menu button i mean a home button and also you have menu on the right hand left hand side and you've got a back button on the right hand side uh these only pop up when you ask for them they do illuminate but there are settings that allow you to turn that off just so you get an idea of the size of the phone let's compare it to the galaxy nexus uh as you can see the samsung galaxy s3 has a bigger screen it's a 4.8 inch super amoled screen it's got the corning glass like i mentioned but a nice touch is that it has very thin bezel so when you go to the edge of the phone your finger sort of just slides off because it's kind of curved and it's very thin to begin with so you're not really feeling that abrupt end like i've reached the end of the phone it's sort of like a waterfall effect that they mentioned it's really nice when you look at them from the back you can kind of see that the galaxy x3 is slightly taller and it's slightly wider it's not pushing galaxy note territory but this is a big phone on the sides it's uh actually 8.6 millimeters so it's a little thinner than the galaxy nexus verizon version but they both got the same part right here where you see this line is defined and it curves to sort of trick your eye into thinking that it's smaller than it is but when you hold it it doesn't feel clunky or big or anything like that uh it does feel large in terms of height but as far as depth goes it's not out of control at all okay i mentioned having a lot of storage now when it comes to files on your phone you're going to get 16 gigabyte or 32 gigabytes internally depending on which model or carrier you end up getting if that's not enough space for you there is a micro sd slot on the back so you can get an additional 32 gigabytes of storage uh as you notice right here it's got the samsung nfc sticker on the battery so yes you will be able to use google wallet or android beam samsung beam which i'm going to show you in a little bit also speaking of the battery it's got 2100 milliamps of power now i haven't been able to really fully test it because i haven't had the phone for as much as a week and i think you need to go through a week of actual testing and running it up and down to see how well it's going to perform but so far it's been doing good early science point to yes uh follow up in the link below with when the full review is up that you'll be able to get more information on how the battery performs as far as the internal specs you get a lot with this phone it has a 1.5 gigahertz dual core processor it's running qualcomm instead of the exynos which is quad core but that's because in order to get 4g compatibility in the us they had to do it that way you know they're using att t-mobile sprint and verizon exynos is not compatible with any of their 4g networks at the moment so all the carriers opted to future-proof their devices and get the qualcomm you're not really mentioning missing much as far as performance goes this thing really zips along i haven't had any issues with it running apps as you can see it pretty much flows through the launcher battery smooth all the apps load quickly uh it has two gigs of ram and i know that sounds like a lot of ram and it is uh not all of it will be available to you like i've had apps running all the time and it only uses up 800 mb and i'll still have another 800 left over so uh there's a lot of free memory that you're always going to have like at the moment i'm using 897 mb and i've got 760 free uh so i've been having parts where i've had pocket casts open i've been tweeting i've been downloading files i've been uh browsing on google plus i've been playing games there's lots of things you're not going to really run into issues as far as performance goes without getting into all the benchmark crap this just flat out works okay that's all that really matters you're not gonna have any hold ups with it overall i'm a fan of the galaxy nexus s3 design i really like this screen i know some people don't like super amoled uh because of the way that there might be some bluish tints which you will see when you go like in the browser when you look at a white background it'll have a more of a blue hue than you would if you compared it side by side by an lcd but that's something that you won't notice unless you really hate super amoled so if you've been looking at the screen all the time you won't notice because the other colors look really great it's very bright and and it's just a very nice screen altogether the size is a little bit bigger than what i would care for i prefer the galaxy nexus i've always said that i wouldn't go any higher than this but i could see myself using this day-to-day they push the boundaries a little bit it's not as slim it's a little wider but it is thinner in depth and it's just a nice overall hardware as like i mentioned you had the home back and menu buttons on the front but a couple of other things i i didn't mention before you've got a 1.9 megapixel front-facing camera that's going to be good for video chat another thing you notice here it's got another sensor on the front that's because it has something in the software that will track your eyes so if you're looking at the screen it'll know not to dim it because you're still reading it so even though if the screen timeout is set for 30 seconds or something it'll keep going until it detects you're no longer looking at the screen uh funny aside it didn't do that good for me unless i was in a bright room i'm assuming that's because i'm of a darker complexion so if you're a lamb colored person like me you know that's the reference for all the better off ted people you might have some issues with that if you're not in a very bright room but other than that it's a cool feature to have on the back the camera is an 8 megapixel camera uh it takes really good follow the link in the description below you'll get some some tips on how the camera performs it's got the flash on the the left hand side and on the right is the speaker now uh a big pet peeve for me for the galaxy nexus is that the speaker was not placed very well so when it's laying flat is it sounds kind of muffled i don't have that problem here it has very loud distinguishable sound it's not crystal clear top of the knot quality it's it's good solid decent quality but what's most important to me is the volume and it comes off very good on here this has been a hardware review of the samsung galaxy s3 available at att t-mobile sprint verizon cspire and us cellular if you enjoyed this video please feel free to watch our software version of the same phone and subscribe to this channel we've got a lot of app reviews and device reviews that you might enjoy this is an android dedicated channel and i'm sure you'll find plenty of content also feel free to like and share this

        "transcript": "hi everyone this is Gan I'm a graphic designer and illustrator for A little over 15 years and today we're going to be taking a look at a couple of Hollywood Undead style mask ideas all right so to me the most interesting of the uh the Hollywood Undead masks and if you've ever seen them they each have a couple of different masks for uh the various videos and such but one of the most interesting masks and we're just going to sketch it out on this paper is uh the one that's basic basically uh on one side it's smiling and on the other side it's it's frowning so we're just going to sketch a basic face shape that you might be using in a mask do a quick line across for the eyes now uh I'm also going to do a quick mouth line here because one of the important parts of this particular mask is that uh it's got a border line down the center and on the right side of this mask the mouth uh connects uh the smile to the uh the left-handed um frowning area so we'll just draw a quick little smiling mouth and the other side is frowning makes kind of a I don't know like a little parallelogram kind of shape so from there we've got our mouth roughly and we'll just do a quick nose line there if you're going to be wearing this mask make sure that you measure your eyes so so you know about how far apart they're going to be so that you can see out of the Mask uh now in this case uh the mask is a little smaller than my head so I'm just doing this for de demonstration purposes and I know that I want my eyes about this far apart and as I said the one side we're smiling we're happy so we have to make sure that the eye is smiling and happy as well so just go in and draw your basic eye shape and then draw the eyebrows nice happy eyebrow he's like hey hey look at me I'm a nice smiling happy eyebrow we got the cheek line here you know when you smile you'll have a little bit of a cheek line and the nose is going to be roughly the same for both sides and then we're going to switch to the other eye and on the actual mask the eye droops a little bit here on the uh the outside so we'll just make it a little bit uh authentic to the actual mask and then we're going to take this eyebrow and we're just going to aim it down a little bit so we got the angry frowny face right here on this side and I'm just going to fill this in so you can you can see it but you might actually cut this out and then I'll finish the smiley face shading over here so anyway what you have your basic mask features drawn out now I'm just going to shade These Eyes in real quick you're going to want to grab a pair of scissors and the paper that we're using here is tear away paper so I'm just going to tear that out real quick and then just go in and cut along your mask outline obviously if you wanted to get more involved you can get a bunch of clay and you can sculpt a pretty cool mask but I'm just showing you how to do one here real quickly just making it out of paper Okay so there you go and get yourself a little bit of ribbon in this case we got some some red ribbon here and there's tape sticking everything in sight and again you're going to want to put this probably around your head so you can get an accurate measurement an idea of how much ribbon you're actually going to need uh you can alternately just take a length of ribbon and staple to either side and and tie it in the back so for now we're going to take this a little bit above the che line cheek line so that it uh it goes right above your ears so that'll be just just below your eyes there okay we just going to grab the staple here and entirely miss the ribbon all right so I'm just going to pull the staple out and uh try this again here real quick we probably don't want to let the kids do this part all right there you go so we get that on the one side and then uh we're just going to go and staple this on the other side as well there we go and for this example I'm just going to cut this out in the center here and if you've used a long enough piece of ribbon you can do this and then you can take this and uh put this around the back of your head and just tie yourself a little knot and uh there you go you got your own little Hollywood Undead mask all right so there you have it there is uh a couple of mask ideas that you can make quickly and easily at home see you next time"

        "transcript": "hey guys I'm Nick aka the one Nicks games and today I wanted to talk to you guys about my gaming PC I did a video about two weeks ago talking about me ordering my gaming PC how I ordered it and it was on its way and it should have been done about like two Fridays ago but some issues occurred some uh some setbacks if you will what were those setbacks well my motherboard was uh was bad I got a bad motherboard and uh coincidentally the motherboard probably did something to a processor I'm not confirmed on that happening but um for some reason the processor didn't work in any of any motherboards and the motherboard itself was fried and so I sent it back to New Egg at this time I don't know what's going to happen I don't know if new egg is going to tell me to go screw myself or if they're actually going to replace a broken product product that I basically confirmed was broken it wasn't even boot into BIOS um and for those of you who are PC nerdy guys you know that uh that's that's most definitely a faulty motherboard and um it would power up for about 2 seconds and then shut off and I tried everything from making sure all the power connected you know the the 24 pin connector the motherboard was plugged in nice and secure I unplugged it and plug it back that didn't work I I started making sure it wasn't the power supply so I removed some parts of the PC from you know I removed the graphics card and the graphics card is going to take about 100 plus Watts so if it's power supply that's going to solve that issue still didn't boot into bio same issue um basically I narrowed it down to either be the motherboard itself or the processor and um honestly I don't know which one so I sent both back to Newegg I sent both my Intel Core i7 processor and my motherboard back to New EG $450 worth of parts were sent back to New EG and we're going to see what happens I mean they're supposed to get back to me later today or on Monday and if they don't get back to me by that point I'm going to have to start calling people because that's five business days for them to uh to review it since receiving they received it last Friday it is Friday now so that means they should have that information to me later today because like they because of time zones they are still working for like another hour or two or Monday would be the uh the latest they can get that to me so I'm going to call them on Monday if I don't have any information and see exactly what's going on and if they tell me that they're not going to do anything about it then uh I'm going to take the steps to uh to maybe had maybe try to get you guys to help me out to uh to get this thing built because if I have to buy these parts again that's a lot of money $400 is a lot of money for me especially running a channel this size and and everything's growing this channel is growing my YouTube Network's growing you know that that I uh co-own and everything like that we're growing amazingly but um at the same time I don't want to be investing a lot of money into this whenever um I've already done it once and they sent me a bad part you know it's not my fault that the part was bad so for that reason I don't think I should have to have to pay for it and and it's not right for me to make you guys pay for it either so I'm going to offer something in return that's basically what I'm saying I'm going to uh to do some things to maybe offer you guys some products some some merchandise or something along those lines to uh to then hopefully get enough money and raise enough money via doing that to be able to um to to replace my processor and my motherboard if I have to replace them I'm hoping newe gets back to me he like yo man we sent you bad parts here's new parts are bad and most of the time I think that they will do that most of the time New Egg is is very good about that and so we're going to see if they're good in this case but I just wanted to update you guys on this uh the update on my gaming PC is all the parts work I've tested most of the parts in a different PC actually so um that means my graphics card my Ram things like that actually do work um it's just that my motherboard and processor weren't working with each other the motherboard was broken which thus in turn I think um made the processor have some issues and I could be completely wrong on that uh about the processor so I'm going to say that guys for those you guys who know more than about PCS than I do the processor might be fine it might be completely fine and if that's the case awesome and hopefully they'll just send me back the one that I had previously and if they do that cuz it's working that's completely fine I don't care about that but I do know the motherboard did have an issue um I I looked through forms and things like that and figured out that there was a uh a problem with the motherboard that I had so I sent it back and we're going to see exactly how that works and also the reason I sent the processor back is um some forms and how-to videos and things like that that I watched also said the processor could be causing the issue alongside the motherboard so it's it's it's both they're both working in tandem maybe to to cause the issue or it's just one I don't know new will hopefully fix that figure all that out for me and then uh handle the situation appropriately but anyway guys I just wanted to update you and and let you know my status on my gaming PC know that when I do get it I will be uh doing videos on it and things like that and uh get everything running I will be doing videos on it and talking about it more and that but until then that's kind of the status and we're just going to wait it out if you guys want to know more about my gaming PC I do update people on Twitter uh about the situation as soon as it happened and uh things like that so you can follow me at Nick King show on Twitter uh first link in the description all that awesome stuff to go follow me on Twitter and get the latest and greatest updates about my gaming PC and other things in my life and other content I produce outside of this channel cuz I produce a lot of it anyway guys hope you enjoyed this video sorry it's not on the upbeat tone that I would like that it's on the downbeat tone I had some faulty Parts with my PC but I am working on fixing those and hopefully by the middle of May by the middle of this month I will have a gaming PC to play and run Minecraft and get back to making awesome Minecraft video for videos for you guys nevertheless I'm Nix games and I'm out peace and here's some videos you guys might want to go check out on the left is how to install shaders in Minecraft 1.7.2 in that video I show you exactly how to install shaders

        "transcript": "[Music] 30 years ago 30 years ago you took the job I know but obviously A lot's changed since then what were your best memories from that period Well I I would say the best memory for me personally about this stadium has to be a promotion the Blackburn game yeah cuz that was a culmination of five years hard work there about 3 minutes left as MRI turns it in that's made it Che and now Palace are in the first Division and the final whistle went and this whole ground was full of people you know that's the warmest glow I think I've ever felt in football in terms of what it meant you know everything about it w was just such a special special thing and that is my one abide memory of this place just made me go Goose pimply there obviously at 91 remember scoring a back heel down there against Liverpool he's got his man he's roundpie it's in there we finished third that year yeah is that possibly the best we could have done um yeah like that that season right from day one we were winning games and we just knew we had a good team and we thought you know we we can go a hell of a long way here and we'd win game after game after game and it was almost as if people were saying Oh They'll they'll trip up sooner or later and we never did when we finished third we missed out on Europe which should have been rightfully ours which would have been the next step I think not getting Europe and then Ian right in particular you know I would have to single him out deciding that his to satisfy his football and Ambitions he had to go elsewhere I think that was a signal for a lot of people that we touch the glass [Music] ceiling obviously first impressions of the lounge no superb um I must admit before I the the few occasions I had been in here it I thought it was a little bit Tatty ooh Tatty but people did say to me it was one of the most popular lounges and I couldn't understand it and then they told me it was because of the toilets in the corner everyone used to use the toilets they never actually stayed in there just St to use the toilet but this this is is different gear this is uh very special and I hope it's uh well appreciated and well used by the people who use this Lounge the you know obviously the game's completely changed and it's it's a global thing now and you know the revenue that comes in you know where where could Palace see themselves could Palace be a sustainable Club in the Premier League oh no no I I think now it can be a sustainable Club in the Premier League again because of the density of gimy pots around here the number of people who live within a walkable distance the number of people who who have lived within a walkable distance and now moved out who still feel this is their special Club I think the the volume of support is such uh that it it can be sustained I think there is wealth in the area um there there is somebody or a group at the the Helm of the ship who are pointing it in the right direction without sacrificing the future gambling the future for shortterm Success you you always used to talk about the spine of the team you know we had Nigel Martin we had Thor and Eric Jeff Andy myself and righty you see a similar spine to the team now with the team out out there well the the players you mentioned um became you know very very established you know that that was what the team was all about um you know we could have players in the wide areas who were massively important you know you think Eddie MRI John salaro Richard Shaw and Pembo and John humph all vital vital players but that solid spine all terrific players were massively important I would say at the moment it's not being established but the principle is still still the same you know I think Neil obviously a wise old fox in managerial terms you know he knows what football is about and he knows if you've got that stability it goes an awful long way towards a successful team still to be established but being created where about yourself now have you any desires to to manage once more oh no no I you know to be absolutely honest I've done over a thousand games I have to say I don't really put myself out there now I still uh watch football I enjoy football but to be honest I would probably have to say that football might have retired me whether I like or not so yeah I accept that I've had a good run the wheel turns it's all about new people coming in um but maybe there's a a swans song in there one day P's always been a a that's given youth its chance you know that's its identity do you think that it's still that now no it has to be that way um you know it is a Community Club South London is very proud of this club and in return the club has to be very proud of its youngsters and give them that opportunity a route a possible route to fulfill dreams I think it's massively massively important something that Ron nodes was particularly keen on and over the years you know now with the development of under 20 football I loved it a year or so ago you come and watch Palace under 21s and they were all local boys I think that under 21 League the development of the young kids coming through again the massive number of games being played on a Sunday morning for young kids in South London it has to be that this club has got all the rich pickings from all those matches all those kids with dreams and I think it's brilliant when a local Boy comes through and hits a big time playing for this club m I'm glad you're coming down this weekend thanks for speaking to me look forward to it yeah look forward to it big history lot of time for you thank you very much Bry thanks for the invite"

        "transcript": "It used to be common to have a new dance craze every year. They were new. They had catchy names, funny steps and some stack around for a while. Since the Renaissance, European monarchs hosted many dance fads that became social crazes. The minuet, the mazurka and the waltz are\nin this long list. However, it was in the 20th century that these dance crazes reached the peak of their popularity. One could say that \"The Charleston\" was the\nmother of all dance crazes. Believed to be born in the American harbor\ncity of the same name, \"The Charleston\" has many variations. Solo, with a partner, quick and slow. Here we go: Popularized in 1920's, we believe that it\ntakes its name from famous vaudeville actor Harry Fox, but the dance itself was created\nby African American dancers a decade before that. The \"Fox Trot\" looks similar to a waltz,  but it has a different tempo. Let's see: From Fox to Fox, this dance became a huge trend in Paris in 1936.  The French celebrated New Year's Eve with a \"Hot Fox\". It looks like a Charleston with some variations,  but it was described as faster, crazier and hotter. However, it didn't last too long. An old English Tune modernized by the Americans.  The original song dates to the seventeenth century and it is believed that it was already a dance.  Later, in the late 1930s, it was orchestrated and choreographed for ballroom dancing.  As opposed to the previous dances,                           created closer to the 20s, \"The Chestnut Tree\" was a very innocent dance and it didn't have any sensuality. Many would say, \u201cWhat's the point then?\u201d,\nbut the truth is that it became very popular. Now, this was another very popular Party Dance.\nIt used to be hugely successful in the UK and in many countries of the Commonwealth.\nListening to the lyrics of its tune tells us a lot about the social values of the early\n40s. Pay attention: While the band is playing to a waltz we will say Then you'll see us strut along down Swinging our Blues away. And if we should quarrel We'll make up and understand Strolling in the Park Parade Yip-pee, ain't love grand. American soldiers brought the \"Lindy Hop\" to\nEurope in 1942, but English dance instructors and ballroom gurus found it foreign and vulgar.\nSo they developed an elegant version of it, called \u201cThe Jive\u201d. It became a World Wide\nphenomenon and in 1968 it was adopted as the 5th Latin dance in international competitions. And we get to the 60s. Since the 20s the World hadn't seen such popularity of dance crazes. There used to be a new dance craze\nevery week, with songs like \"The locomotion\" and \"The Mashed Potato\" hitting hard. This one,\nthe \"Golly Golly\" was particularly popular in London clubs in 1962. In the mid 60s, a dance called                                     \u201cThe Shake\u201d became the new trend.  Easy to describe, the dancer shakes the body until the tune stops. Nothing more. It might sound dull, but \u201cThe shake\u201d transcended the dance craze of the summer category  and it became a standard move in many dances still danced today. Did you think this was vintage or old fashioned? Think of \"The Macarena\", \"Saturday Night\", \"The Shuffle\" or \"Gangnam Style\".  Not so long ago, was it? Let us know which dance crazes you remember by leaving a comment below."

        "transcript": "Argentina is undoubtedly known for, among other things, the high quality of its beef. For the past few years, however, the multimillion soybean industry has been threatening traditional livestock production, from which the high-quality beef comes from. The great expansion of soy production has driven a great deal of livestock out of the fields. Today, around 6 million animals are the target of an intensive meat production system known as \"feedlot.\" This system is giving way to a sharp cultural change in a country that has always been used to eating meat from pasture-fed cattle. Jeronimo Oviedo is 66 years old and has been working with cattle in the fields for almost his entire life. I keep these cattle through great sacrifice. The cattle I sell is grass-fed only and it's really good beef, because they aren't in feedlots. One could say that Argentina has traditionally been a producer and consumer of bovine meat -- or cow meat, as we call it -- that is, beef whose origin is pasture-fed cattle. Dario Torres, like very few others, knows the job of a butcher. That's why we've asked him for his opinions on the subject, from inside his butcher's shop. Almost all the livestock that's produced today comes from feedlot production practices. Almost none of the beef comes from pasture-fed cattle. I'd say this feedlot beef amounts to 90 percent of the beef consumed in our country. People have started to realize that the meat tastes different. Many are refusing to eat this feedlot beef. I've had problems myself. Yes, Argentine beef has changed a great deal in the past few years. Argentine beef is no longer what it was, because of feedlots. It doesn't taste the same. Feedlot grain isn't the same. You notice the difference when you eat this beef, when you put it on the barbecue or cook it in a pot. The taste of \"natural\" beef, from pasture-fed cattle, is completely different. I'd say that the Argentine favorite -- the beef that is preferred by the average Argentine -- is the one that comes from\npasture-fed cattle. Many people reject the beef that comes from confined cattle because they say it tastes like pork, which is a way of describing the taste of the meat, but which has a logical explanation. The explanation is related to the fatty acids that are formed when grain is used as feed, and\nthe fatty acids formed when cattle are fed with pasture. One tastes different from the other. In addition to talking about the taste of the meat, Carlos Ramos, an engineer, warns us that the beef that results from confinement-feeding technology is less healthy than pasture-based beef. And in turn, this is related to human health issues concerning meat that originates in pasture-fed cattle vs. meat that comes from grain-fed cattle in feedlots, which is what Europeans value. Europeans appreciate not only the \"natural\" side of pasture-based beef, but they also appreciate\npasture-based beef because they know that, from a human health perspective, pasture-based beef\nhas many advantages that the beef produced in feedlots does not have. Here, they have a lot of space -- all the fields -- to be at ease and to walk, which they can't do in a feedlot. They are simply all crammed together. Despite the unchecked expansion\nof soy production and the difficulties he faces in doing his job, Jeronimo states that he won't give up the traditional livestock\nproduction practices he has followed all of his life. While more than 70 percent of cattle head in Argentina today end up in feedlots, Jeronimo is set on keeping the \"gaucho\" culture alive in the hope that the famous Argentine beef will live on."

        "transcript": "hey Griff hlin here in today's video I'm going to show you a a really quick little lick but it's something that comes up a lot um for example uh catfish Blues by Muddy Waters uh is is very much in this style it's just kind of a slow and then he does that little lick uh something like voodo CH by Jimmy Hendricks or or Stevie [Music] Ron uses that same kind of thing and it's this open it's this Bend IN in sort of the open E uh Blues position so I'm want to show you how that works today and just show you some options for how you could use it so the first thing is what I'm going to be bending is the second fret uh on the it's an A on the third string and I'm going to bend it up a whole step so make it sound like that and then back down and then pull off to the open third string and then finally I'm going to hit the uh the second fret on the fourth [Music] string now that may seem fairly simple but it is a little bit tricky to get it to come out just right it's also a little bit harder to bend because you're on the third string and not the second or the first as we often do uh plus the lower you get down on the fretboard the it's slightly more difficult to bend uh just because you're close to the uh to the nut here so it's a little bit of a challenge or may be to get that up but once you get it I assure you it'll be worth it you know don't be afraid to use a helper finger you can see I have my first finger which is helping me push it up while my while my middle finger makes sure that it stays on the Fret board my first finger can help push it [Music] up and then really it's just a matter of putting that lick into the rhythm of whatever you're doing so if you're doing something like catfish Blues which is very [Music] slow and all I'm doing during the the vocal part is just hitting the low E [Applause] [Music] and that's basically how almost that entire song goes uh for something like Voodoo Child it's or Voodoo Child I guess I should say [Music] [Applause] uh and there's going to be subtle variations depending on which version of this youu here but I'm basically playing an e and what I'm doing on this one is I'm not not really I'm not really pushing down on the third string so I get a power chord instead of a full-blown major chord it gives it a slightly different sound here's the power chord version there's the major chord version so I'll do something like a third on the sixth string then I'll hit the second fret the E this is the octave um on the fourth string and then I'll like maybe hit the top two strings open and then the lick so you put that all together and you get something like [Applause] this and it's a little bit messy as you can hear I occasionally hit the wrong string and it doesn't really it's one of those things that doesn't have to be perfectly clean all the time it's it's kind of an attitude sound um as I was thinking about what other Tunes I know that use this uh are you going to go my way by Lenny Kravitz came to [Music] mine which is the same lick uh second fret on the fourth string second fret on the fifth string open fourth string second fret on the fourth string so it's the same idea [Music] but in a more rock [Music] context and I'm sure there are you know a bunch of other places I know I've heard that same idea used in many other places over the years that's just what I could think of off the top of my head right now but now that you've heard that sound and played that sound you'll recognize it when you hear it in other places so if you happen to hear a tune uh that has that exact same riff in it you know leave a comment uh so everybody else can can find it there so uh I hope you enjoyed this lesson I know it's a short one today but uh should be fun and I will see you soon"

um this 100% I hope so so yeah okay so what I want to talk about today is something as funny as XP gaining or XP waste or XP in general basically because uh very recently you know one of my friends called whoops uh he did a pretty impressive kind of record-breaking XP in one day kind of thing you know I think gained like 10 million smithing XP in one single day now he did this like pendants and Hummers and adant bars and I'm not too sure what it was making basically but it basically managed to get over 10 million XP in one single day break in the world record in fishing XP in one day basically but unfortunately the Rune track was kind of broken you know so it didn't get enough cut um noticed on the Rune track but it's on the other Rune trucker kind of thing though I believe uh but even though he did um not get this kind of record on the rune track you later on broke the same record uh with a little bit less XP 7.5 million XP in one day which is pretty insane in my opinion you know and I think that's kind of impressive so I kind of got the idea like do other people well do I mostly like consider to get a lot of XP very fast or how do I change my XP basically uh whoops you know he recorded his little view of this thing so if you're interested in watching a pretty long video actually I think it's like 30 minutes very spit up like it's 24 hours spit up you know so uh it last for 30 minutes with some music stuff in the background well I add the link to that in the description if you want to check it out it's pretty cool you know even though it takes a little while to watch it through but you can see the XP Cod just like hop around like super fast it's pretty fun to watch basically uh but yeah as I was saying uh XP gaining you know since I started RuneScape I haven't really be getting that much xp you know we can figure out the XP per hour I believe in the normal runescope if take like the adventure Lo days and share it on your tot spear or something like that I'm not too sure but some kind of wear stuff like that basically so it's pretty cool something to check up I guess kind of just fun fact for your own sake I I guess yeah I don't know uh but personally I have been trying very recently to get a lot of XP quite fast but elit you know I haven't been very good at it you know one of my best records I think is like 1.5 million XP in a day and not counting Slayer which was like 18 well not 18 million but um 12 million in a day that's pretty fair enough I guess that's um I think that's good but yeah as I was saying uh I'm wonder if you guys have been like getting a lot of XP or you if you guys focus on getting a lot of XP every day or if you I don't know uh just playing along and just skill as you want to skill if that makes any sense that's the moment you know I'm getting 98 fishing I'm like I don't know uh 7 139,000 XP away from 98 you know and I'm pretty proud of that I'm going to get that today you you know are you guys thinking like that or are you like okay it's like 700k XP left I get that eventually I don't know I'm for because I'm not really sure how you guys think about that uh because sometimes you know I put myself gos and such in the game like uh today I want to get this m XP or today I want to do this and today I want to do that the rest I can do tomorrow but I don't want to sleep before I've completed my daily goal basically I think that's a pretty good thing for me to be going for you know because it kind of gives me a little thing to go for look kind something and kind of something to achieve you know so I know that okay I did that I can do that later on as well basically so I think I mentioned that one time I gained and one million fishing speed in a day which I'm pretty proud of which means that but I'm most likely going to be able to get 98 fishing somewh some well at some point tonight basically uh which I think is going to be pretty awesome after that I'm heading solers you know to get 250 more seals before I get another 98 to continue like that basically so uh yeah what more you can of say here basically uh XP gaining you know do you guys also focus a lot on getting a lot of XP in very short time I'm kind of curious about that because it's like uh for example with skillers and Slayers you're like uh I don't want to do this because it takes a long time or the same thing with agility no I don't want to train agility because it takes a long time basically and uh a lot of people say this because it's XPR is quite slow you know do you guys kind of focus on that do you want to get much xp as fast as possible uh personally I kind of want to get a lot of XP as fast as possible after I had Max no because when I started with this account just started with the hardest skills like s first and Mining and well wait until afterwards I believe yeah yeah far making doesn't count far making though but yeah you you get my dri I got a lot of hor skills in the beginning without really minding about anything else I guess you know so at the moment I'm going to get a lot of spe pretty quickly CU I am trying to finish all the horse skids as quick as possible which means they need to focus a lot on experience and stuff like that uh I'm not sure if my point of this video have really been coming across here because I kind of just been blabbering about and hopefully some of you have understood what I'm trying to reach here uh let's see after switch thing here there there and there cast okay great uh but basically what I'm asking is if you guys focus a lot on experiments while you're playing the game or if you're doing something else uh for example getting a lot of cast Wars games or doing Quest or such uh or if you are a professional Skiller or a cometer or whatever you might want to be and you go for a lot of experience a day because a lot of people do that and a lot of people find achievements in getting on the um uh top daily exhib kind of thing on the Rune truck and such you know that is pretty cool I have ADM that it it is a pretty hard goal and it's something to go for because there's a lot of hardcore players in this game you also notice that with the um hang on here I'll last you also notic that with the uh old school service you know when it was released because a lot of people were going for that when it was uh released like a bunch of people got a lot of XP very very quickly I believe the first 99 was a 30 mil experience in like I don't know 5 days 4 days you know and that is insane in my opinion and you know I think that some people do really work hard in order to become the get the most possible XP in very short time and I I think we'll notice that with um what's it called uh domination as well you know so that's going to be pretty exciting and well I think that's something we can I don't know look forward to well you know personally I'm going to know life a lot to get a bunch of XP a lot of levels really really fast and divination because I kind of want to be on the front page for a certain time you know uh just for fun you know I'm not going to be the first one to 99 anyways because I'm not getting 99 uh anyways anytime soon basically but it's something to go for I guess uh so yeah I guys let me know your opinions about XP and XP gaining and such or XP wasting in the comment section below what what are you guys doing what do you guys prefer and something like that basically my name is will miss it and I'll see you guys later very short on HP at the moment uh whenever he's running short we're going to run away as well uh so we do hopefully not risk too much here hopefully"

        "transcript": "let's send you to John kernin well NASCARs Kurt bush is getting ready for his first race in Pro Stock competition taking on Erica enders in just a few moments and Kurt are there any nerves at all about doing something so new to you there are the nerves but it's been a great weekend for us to qualify for one thing that was our main objective now we're in U eliminations this is Sunday and you can just feel the different atmosphere here in NH on what it means to be part of Sunday's activity so we're we're stoked we're excited I've had a great group of guys great sponsors and that it's been a great ride but now it's time we got to go up there and lay down a good lap as well as cut a good tree well he's in somewhat familiar territory Eric Enders number is 48 in Nascar the last 5 years everybody's been chasing the 48 Car of Jimmy Johnson for the championship and Mike D you think he can do it we're going to see that shortly he's done a good job up to this point like he said the key will be the reack time out Star Line he's done a great job of getting the car down the racetrack let's send you to John ker here Enders back in the pits waiting for her first round match up against Kurt bus and you know he's gotten a lot of attention being a NASCAR guy coming down here what's it like you facing him in the first round are you nervous too no I mean it doesn't matter who's in the other lane I told the guys yesterday uh every Sunday I've got to go up and race myself no matter who's over there I got to go up cut a light hit my shift points and get the car stopped safely and you know hopefully at the end of the day we'll come out on top but uh and we'd like to be the number 48 car that you can't be so we'll see how it goes I think it's great for the sport it's getting Pro Stock a lot of attention that we didn't get before and um they're a tough cars to drive and I'm glad that we could shed a light on it and um maybe one of us can go over and drive NASCAR one day that would be a fun trade yes it would thanks Erica now this morning Kurt Bush told me that he had to do exactly what she just said easier said than done though Mike yeah he he knows all how the process is supposed to go it's the Tire Kingdom Gator Nationals we're in Gainesville Florida John Kernan Dave Reef Gary Gerald Mike duns next to me I'm Paul pige and this is it this is Erica Enders and Kurt bus and Mike Dunn says it's going to be Kurt bus and I say it's going to be Erica well and if it is Kurt it would be an upset cu the one thing about Kurt is he's only had a car in the other lane twice both times he messed up one he was timed out and he said that was his fault he was watching the other driver other car cuz he was thinking like NASCAR and he knows now that in Drag Racing you just focus on the tree and getting the car down the lane and don't worry about the car in the other lane the other run he actually brought the RPM up a little too quick after he went in stage first you're supposed to wait in Pro St until the last car stages once that last stage light comes on then both drivers will mat the throttle that means they go to Full Throttle there's a chip that holds the RPM and once they release the clutch then allows the RPM to come up and away they go and Curt's hoping he gets off that line quickly Johnson family put put that car together for him that's why they're so interested on the line and there's a big difference between knowing what to do and doing it Erica had the hole shot on him and carries it all the way I win so does Erica Eric Anders 653 21 but a respectable 654 for Kurt puss nice to see him here and moreover nice to see him having a really good time and he has been and and I think he's done a great job these cars are very hard to drive had an 049 Reaction Time a respectable time Erica was almost 300 of a second quicker with that 021 and then ran slightly quicker watch CT is on board he's been doing a great job with this all week when I talked to Alan Johnson shift points been pretty good uh pretty much all week in our since he got in the car basically and then the reaction time was wasn't too bad but when you uh take a look at our Lucas Oil photo finish cam by about half a carlink Erica Enders advances to the second round and you know we got a giant crowd here you think they didn't like that oh it brought them to their feet you can see an two different Expressions there can't you kind of like Mike and I every Pro Stock driver in this field qualified with a career fast ET alen Johnson seemed satisfied with what Kurt Busch did there let's go to Gary Gerald he caught up with Kurt bus and alen Johnson well a pair of uh guys that have brought a lot of attention to the Pro Stock class here at Gainesville the gator Nationals Kurt Bush Allan Johnson who's been somewhat of a mentor how would you evaluate this weekend Kurt well it was a little shady on Friday but Saturday was a great day we got ourselves a solid qualifying run in got to enjoy the fourth pass as far as qualifying and then to be here this morning on eliminations you know we achieved something special by getting in the show and then here we are just to go down by thousandths of a second a little bit on our run a little bit on the tree I think we made a respectable pass this is a tough game this is Pro Stock this is drag racing but I had the best group to help me Allan Johnson Roy building the power with this mopark group I just can't thank shell and Dodge enough for the fun we had just wish we could have gone a little bit further into the rounds and Allan I know great disappointment your car recently didn't moveing that left lane early but as a mentor how's he been as a student he's been great it's been like he said a very fun process watching them evolve watching them just take the challenge and grab it and he didn't do this for show he's serious about it you know that was what was really fun to watch for his crew I mean they're all loving this weekend drag racing NH uh they love it every one of them said we just love this and for Mopar and Dodge you know we didn't have the weekend we wanted but hey we uh we had a we're we're good as they say in the South come back and see us here that's right appreciate it guys thanks what's not to love"

        "transcript": "hello everybody this is Mino haxer here bringing you guys a new episode of sumoner support School in this episode we'll be taking a look at how to take dragon without losing any HP most people have a good understanding that as a support you should be tanking the majority of the damage that Dragon deals due to the fact that dragon's attacks have an attack speed debuff since supports have the least damage output out of your entire team it's better for you to tank the damage than your allies but tanking all those Dragon hits can have a really big toll on your HP and usually causes you to use a few health pots or recall afterwards instead of having to lose so much HP there's a really interesting technique you can use to minimize the amount of damage that Dragon deals to you and when used perfectly can cause you to take zero damage the basic idea of this technique is AB using two main facts that Dragon will always attack the target closest to it and the fact that dragon can change its Target of focus and a limited amount of times what you want to do is have dragon constantly Chang change its Target between you and your closest Ally that's hitting dragon have an ally start hitting dragon and make sure that your ally is the closest Champion to Dragon at the start once Dragon begins to focus its attention to your ally move closer to dragon's attack range than your ally this will cause Dragon to start attacking you instead of your ally you will know this by the orange outline that dragon has now before the dragon can use an auto attack what you want to do is to quickly run behind your ally now if you do it fast enough the dragon will not have used an auto attack yet and will change its Target of focus to your ally instead of you by repeating this process over and over again you can continue to confuse dragon and have it not throw out any attacks for the entire duration that it lives this is a really difficult move to pull off but here are a few tips to make it a little bit easier one it helps a lot if your teammate that is attacking Dragon doesn't move around while attacking this is because it will make it a lot easier to know when you're moving in and out of the dragon's Focus another thing you can do is have boots of speed when doing this by moving a bit faster you have a lot more freedom to overstep or under step out of the dragon's attack range I hope you enjoyed this episode of Summoner support school if you enjoyed it feel free to hit the like button subscribe for future episodes or leave a comment letting me know what you want to see next"

        "transcript": "this morning on today's home for do-it-yourself projects can add value to your home it might not be the best time to sell a home but it is a good time to build up equity with affordable upgrades amy matthews is a remodeling expert and host of the diy network sweat equity amy good morning good morning nice to see you we're talking about things here you're not trying to tempt a buyer right now you're trying to put value in your home so when the time comes that you are going to sell it you get a better price exactly we all want our house to look and function beautifully we don't want to spend a lot of money doing it but we want a great return on our investment when it does come time to sell and so i brought some fun things and i'm not the handiest person in the world and for people like me these are things we can actually do ourselves and not mess them up i promise you okay i will show you how got these countertops these laminate countertops you want to replace these how easy is it this is actually a refinishing kit for these these are so dated they always look bad and sometimes they're in disrepair and if you can't you know afford a granite or a marble that's 50 to 100 a square foot this is a great thing to do so it's kind of like polishing your nails you've done that i'll walk you through it okay all right so you actually clean this off you sand it down kind of like you're buffing it down you put on a primer coat that prepares it to for the final top coat and you end up with a really transformed beautiful counter and it's going to add a probably about a thousand dollars in value and the whole thing only cost a hundred dollars to do only a hundred dollars because you're using a gloss paint as opposed to some other material that's much more expensive exactly and you buy it in a kit you can buy these the primer and the paint and then you buy the kit all the tools that you need are under a hundred bucks private it doesn't feel good and you see your doors and you use your doors every single day you go into a house where they have real solid doors it just makes it feel like the house was built well yes it packs a punch it's beautiful this is a douglas fir it's a nice shaker style goes in bungalows so this feels like quality in your hands and then if you want something a little bit different and more fun you can go with a glass door these are good for media rooms maybe a family room and one of my favorites is this chalk door which is great for kids play room children's play rooms things like that what if you start to rehang doors here and i mean how do you make sure they're level and square good question you have this tool and this is a tool every tool room across the country should have it's actually so new we're so cutting edge here on today it's not even in the store yet you can get it online it's called levelbest2.com and it costs about 20 bucks but it's the only tool out there that is a carpenter square okay so you need to know that your door's square but you also have to make sure that it's level and plumb and it has a ruler in there so even if you're just going to try and hang a picture straight this is the tool talk about tile work bathrooms and kitchens you hear it all the time those are the things that add value to your house what are we doing homes well it's a great way to transform your kitchen because nowadays we're not just cooking in our kitchen we're entertaining in our kitchen it's got to have a pop of art tiling is one of the easiest things you can learn how to do yourself and it adds a lot of bang for your buck so what i brought was this is from doll tile these are all beautiful there's a lot of accent tiles in here that you can use they're not cheap a lot of times they'll run thirty to fifty dollars a square foot so use them sparingly so if you have a wall like this and you wanna spruce it up you can actually chisel out selected tiles and end up with something looking like this so you're spending a little less on the expensive tile you've still got a lower cost field tile chiseling it out is not the easiest thing to do in the world so if you're a tile virgin start with just a new frame backsplash what kind of value can we add to a house by doing this in a kitchen and a bathroom in the kitchen thousand two thousand dollars easy um in value and also you have that perceived value that fire potentially is going to see in the long run all right if you have a basement in your home you say it's time to add an egress window this looks a little more complicated this is actually quite easy the hole that you dig is big but you get a really good workout doing it so this is the back side i want to show you how it's put together it has two side panels and the back panels literally snap into place so it's three parts and the whole thing from the front looks like this in your basement so the best way to add value in the basement is by adding light and air so it doesn't feel like a basement so you set this in your window goes in front of it and you actually have the safety of having an egress where you can step out into the yard or a firefighter can get in in case of emergency but in the meantime you've got something beautiful to look at you can actually plant in the state and we're taking a look at one in a room so we actually get a feel for what it does to a room and it does it's wow it really adds a lot of yeah i just put one of these in my house and i absolutely love it because everybody walks down the basement they go it's so bright yeah but again we're excavating here you don't mind if people try this themselves excavating is the easiest it's a workout but you get buff and sexy doing diy projects that's the whole point that's the whole goal right exactly all right amy matthews amy thank you very much we appreciate it and for more of these projects you can log on to our website at todayshow.com up next we're having pizza for breakfast which right around now sounds great but first this is today on nbc 4."

        "transcript": "sup guys dog here and this is episode two to my serious topics uh episode one so uh this is my first game play on black ops also you know like i said in the other video i just started playing this game it's been lots of fun and this is actually my second game ever trying out the uh i think it's called ptrs or maybe i i'm not even sure but it's definitely a six sniper and i like it a lot so i'm definitely playing this game a lot more but uh anyway one of the serious topics so at um at that point i had realized that she was uh an alcoholic and you know the way she treated me wasn't because she hated me it was just because um the amount of alcohol she was consuming and she just could like couldn't control herself uh like an example of this was one night we uh my family got back from dinner my dad my mom and myself and we uh get out of the truck to go to my house i get out my dad gets out she gets out and she just falls into the ground and this was the first time i ever realized my mom was a drinker because you know she was just playing drunk she just fell straight down out of the truck and uh and i was i was scared i had no idea what was going on my dad ran inside uh grabbed all the alcohol out of the cabinets and stuff and just poured it all down the drains and and was yelling at my mom and having started crying and stuff it was it was crazy and and so on to the time when my dad called me uh this is september of 2010 i think september 10th was the exact day and i tried to forget it most of the time but you know apparently i didn't i didn't know it but uh my mom was like going back and forth between a couple like uh uh like assisted living places i was i didn't really know any of this i thought she was just at the hospital but she was going through a couple assisted living places like people like places with old people but you know she wasn't old she was just she was 47 and so it was it was odd to me when we when my dad told me that and i i was so confused beyond belief like why she would be an old people's home so then my dad gets to the uh att store with me i don't have time to go i don't have my phone or nothing now because uh when when he caught like when he called me my my phone it vibrated so but the screen wouldn't work so i was able to hit the uh call button and answer them but he gets there picks me up in the truck he's like uh we'll go out to lunch a little bit but first we're gonna head to the hospital and i'm like why are we going to the hospital like and he said uh mom was was uh taken there from the living home and so i was confused as heck as to what was going on and then my dad got a call from a cousin of mine melanie and this was when we're in the truck and and he's talking they were like yeah everyone's gonna be the hospital and stuff and so i'm getting real worried like what what the crap is going on here this doesn't make any sense to me and we end up getting to the hospital my dad asks hey where's leslie at so you know they give us a room we go up the elevator and we talk to people and they say oh she got moved to this room so then we go back down the stairs and then or back down the elevator and ask another guy he's like oh well she is back up there so we go back up there and we sit down and it was um i forget what the room was called but it was something weird some uh something weird and the guy's like only two people can go back at a time and so my dad goes back then he comes back i still don't even know what's going on then my entire like eight of my family members show up my cousins my mom's sisters my mom's dad and and i knew something serious was up but no one would tell me like i asked people no one would tell me what was happening and then my dad comes back out and he sits down with me and he's like uh uh phillip um your mom's back in the room right now uh she's on life support uh her liver's shutting down and and there's nothing they can do and and i still like didn't understand and i'm like what what do you mean what what what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] is that and and so i start uh sitting there just thinking then i start crying and it was still even when i was sitting there crying i still didn't i never i still to this day don't even understand what happened uh everyone um i started kicking and punching the walls and stuff uh you know just just staying there screaming in the hospital because i i was so like oblivious to the fact of of what had been going on in the past couple months and um a couple of my relatives went back this year then they came back and melanie said to me um philip would you like to go back and see your mom and you know i still didn't realize like the seriousness of what was happening and she said but then then she said one sentence to me and when she said that it made me understand like everything that was going on she said to me i i if you go back there when you see your mom don't remember how she looks now just remember how she loved you and and i just started crying again like i didn't i didn't understand what that meant and i'm like well i want to see her so we go back there and and sometimes i wish i hadn't done it sometimes i think it was the right decision i'm still confused about everything but we go back there i mean my dad and melanie or me and my dad because uh we're going to be of our time we go back and my mom's like in this in this like hospital bed thing and she's got tubes up her nose down her throat in her arms and and she's on one of those machines like a life support machine like you wouldn't you know like like serious thing like from movies and stuff and um she's she's conscious but she can't talk she can't open her eyes she can't move so i'm just standing there crying talking to her stuff and off i i was just like so like i keep saying just confused and um i stood there for a good five minutes just crying and then then we left and we all went saying this like almost like a conference room type type of thing and we sat there and no one was really talking uh melanie ended up calling my my british cousin paula who got on the phone and started talking to me and stuff and um and then the doctor comes in and he's like uh would you guys like just when should we take her off life support my dad my dad told him and then they took her off life support and she passed away and at when that happened i still didn't even understand it and i still to this day don't uh my next episode i'll finish this thank you guys for watching it's been d treats"

        "transcript": "what's up guys and welcome to another episode of the new series called the number games we have got a pretty decent episode this time uh we've got you know a 30k team um I've tried to keep it a bit more lower in price because I think a lot of people on this game don't really have the most amazing you know amount of coins in the world um so I've tried to keep it like a an amount that people can really afford so as you see here we come up against this kind of standard team um he's got like a serri n in well non rare team um apart from the striker there uh but I think that guy alab Alexander or something like that uh but he's got a lot of pace that's all I really know about him but as see here the first goal from the other guy um you know a pretty decent goal to be honest but kind of a lucky on my behalf you know I don't know what really what my goalkeeper was doing um at all and then here again what is my goalkeeper doing um really really quite annoyed by that but so that made it 2-0 in the 41st minute to him um and I sort of knew I had to do something about it tried to you know sort of Step my game up and really um pursue and try and win um and you see here nice little chip over with elshay uh right into the path of Pau kind of lucky there with the guy heading it straight into P's path but you know that is 45th minute um maybe a bit of scripting in that one I don't really know but a really nice um I don't know what it's called it's called like a hill chop or something um but like it's like a flick Chopper I really can't remember but really nice skill move there from maras and Slots at home and then we got really really lucky um with elshar in the 90th minute goalkeeper just passes it out elshar is there just going to be a poach and Slot at home so the game finished 3-2 which means there well 3 plus 2 is five which means you have to buy the first player um off the fifth page and here we are just setting our search criteria to 3K maximum by now which means the maximum you know we can spend on this team is going to be 30k and I always try and like fulfill that price um I don't really like leaving out you know a few k um because I really want to make it just an actual 30k team but as you see here on the fifth page we've got Roberto Carlos Val Bueno we' got subtit we got Turan um we got that right back but I can't really remember what his name is so I'm not going to try and pronounce it but I think you know we we did have a kind of thought about this I don't really really want to buy uh Val braa you know French team's kind of bit boring and I don't really want to go over all the mainstream stuff hipster yeah whatever but um you know Roberto colosio as well Brazilian player I don't really want to go down that route it's just a bit boring so we go up and end up buying subtit um going to be the first center back in our team and is in a 4312 for so we got a nice formation to build around our team so we also buy as you see there Ivanovic and then we go and bu stankovic so we got three uh Serbian players in our team already which is going to look really nice in our team so the fourth player is going to be Miguel Vala uh or veloso or something like that um but he is a Portugal Cent CID from the Syria and then we also buy as you see there Bas singua to link up with Ivanovic to get n c on that player the center forward in our team is going to be palasio um Argentine really really great player a lot of pace and just you know all round decent player the yes a third Center M actually is going to be Pogba um bronze player yes he has actually moved from United now um from what I know but he is you know a pretty good player he's got really lot well in my opinion an amazing long shot um there might be a few clips of him with a long shot you know very soon I'm not too sure but we also buy see there Evra and then we buy the bruss Dortmund goalkeeper to link up with super TI to make have nine chem but the two Strikers that we go for are saviola as you see here used him in the past he's got four star skills and is just an incredible player for his price and then we go higin um I did want to buy TZ but I didn't really have enough coins I was like 4K short of buying TZ so that was kind of annoying um but you know we can only spend 30k on the team so that is the ending team um there's no links with you know the serria side um and Bundesliga side with Evra and Pogba but you know that is the team um for me I'm really quite happy with it you know it came out a lot better than usual um but just for well first impressions on this team um after playing I think a couple of games so far um you know first impressions really really nice team um I won my first match 5-2 and that just you know sort of spells out how good this team is for me um and you will see the first five goals in this you know the goals at the end to be you know some pretty good goals and I played against the team with like Messi in it PK and this team just destroyed it as you see there hiwi with a really nice finish in the seventh minute to make it one- nil um and then here we go palasio to make it 2-n in the 28th minute which makes it you know a really nice goal um did kind of strug off P there I don't know if that was a bit of EA scripting or whatever um or just you know pure handicap or whatever but see here a really nice goal there uh by saviola just a 360 spin to straight onto the volley and I don't really know whether whether that was a back hill or not um I did upload a video just saying is this back hill or not and people you know kind of said no um a few people said yes so I was kind of a bit you know I didn't really know know whether it was a back hill goal or not um so I'm going to leave that guys that decision to you guys um personally for me after doing it frame by frame by frame I think it's just an EA glitch where it looks like it's a back hill goal um but it really isn't but that's pretty much going to be the end of the video um there's going to be a few more goals but I just like to address something I just wanted to say a massive thank you for the for the support on the recent videos um has been amazing and also for you guys to go and check out my second Channel um I have got I I really don't know what it's called I can't really remember remember but it's like Jack 54 SD or something um I really don't know why I called it that but you know that is what I called it um I might just upload some Call of Duty stuff on there just some other games that I ever play um you know I have a laugh on Call of Duty with a couple of my mates and we just sort of take the piss out of people on there or just we do some GBS so I might upload that it might be a bit of a funny uh channel for you guys to see but other than that guys thank you very much for watching please do hit the like button a th000 likes would be incredible to keep this sort of run of the good lues going on this

        "transcript": "hey guys Jordan back again for some more Battlefield 3 ranting and as highly requested I'm here to rant about the Recon class the Recon class seems to be quite the polarizing topic among Battlefield 3 players as some people swear by the Recon class and some spit on them like lower class citizens figuratively of course players aren't literally spitting on their screens at least I hope not are you no of course not anyways this isn't going to cover every nook and cranny of the Recon class as it is a difficult one to master and I'm nowhere near being great at Recon but there are some topics I feel the need to address as they common issues I see being done ineffectively or not at all okay so if you've watched my previous class rant you'll know that I am a proud supporter of the three key I'll sell players and support players should be pressing the key like it were the key to make their character breathe well today I'm going to be endorsing a new key the q key everyone should be tapping q more often and quicker than they tap me lacunas if they got the chance see see the joke is there that they do it a lot and they're quick in the sack whatever not my best joke sue me if you didn't laugh anyway for those of you who don't play the PC version Q is the spot key so it would be back or select for you guys every should be spotting enemies all the time regardless of class but it's especially important for the Recon class as at a distance it's one of the only ways to actively help your teammates aside from killing people at extreme distances it's actually more important than shooting because the likelihood of a successful one- shot Kill from 800 m is pretty low and while we're on the subject come on guys really 800 M you can't come any closer I mean I'm not saying you should be on the front lines trying to quick scope or something please don't do that and I'm also not saying that it's not okay to attempt shots from that far away but it's the Recons that devote the entire game to sniping from the deployment or from the Caspian Tower or the Firestorm mountains that really chat my ass I mean even at 200 M you're still far enough away from the enemy to have the advantage over them but the closer you get the more accurate you are and the easier it is to help the team out you see chances are if you're up on the summit of Camp [\u00a0__\u00a0] Mountain you're a thousand meters away from any relevant objective and to that I say to you you are a waste of space on the battlefield and I would rather be teamed up with a [\u00a0__\u00a0] wiener dog than you plain and simple if you're that far away you're not concerned with the team your main focus is getting longrange kills for yourself and that's it oh but I'm being a spotter back here [\u00a0__\u00a0] [\u00a0__\u00a0] you you [\u00a0__\u00a0] [\u00a0__\u00a0] you don't have a leg to stand on everyone in the game is being a spotter all the time if you really cared about spotting and you wanted to do a better job of it than anyone else you'd be using the goddamn MAV to do it because it does a much better job at it than you with your rifle no you're back there because you want to get yourself some longrange head shot and that's it and hey getting long range head shots is intensely satisfying I'm not going to deny that but you know what else is satisfying winning the [\u00a0__\u00a0] game at 800 meters away you're not going to be hitting anything with any sort of regularity besides other stationary snipers and at that point all you're doing is having a one-on-one slap and tickle fest with the other sniper and neither of you are doing anything worthwhile for your teams I mean I've seen sniper battles in Gul of om man between US soldiers prone on the aircraft carriers and Russian snipers prone on the coastline congratulations on your little game across the map footsie with that other guy the rest of us are playing the objective and defending our control point you know the [\u00a0__\u00a0] that actually wins games but Jordan I know some of you are saying I've had games where the top player on the team is a sniper he had so many points he must have been doing something for us right no [\u00a0__\u00a0] what he probably wasn't what you're forgetting about is the Marksman bonus if you've never played Recon before you should know that the Recon gets a point bonus for longrange head shots the point bonus is equivalent to the meters they are away from the guy whose kids they just orphaned I think the idea behind this bonus is inherently good giving bonuses for skilled kills as a way to reward said skill but it's also one of the biggest reasons that people camp so far away trying to get head shot from 800 M they get a stupid amount of points for one kill for instance if you see an assault with five kills and 5,000 some odd points you should go shake that guy's hand because to get that many points he probably had 20 revives five or six flag captures and was dropping medkits like they were burning a hole in his pocket or his backpack or whatever it is that Assault Store medkits I'm not quite sure how that works if this were an actual war that guy would get so many congressional Medals of Honor he could use them as wallpaper but if you see a sniper sitting 900 M away from the nearest flag going for head shot with the exact same set of kills and points he most likely didn't do [\u00a0__\u00a0] besides those five headshot kills seeing as how he got 100 points for the kill 10 points for the head shot and oh yeah 900 [\u00a0__\u00a0] points for the Marksman bonus that's over 1,000 points for one kill and that's [\u00a0__\u00a0] absurd no one player should get that many points for one single kill I mean if you tell someone they can get so many points that way the incentive to be a productive member of your team drops significantly I mean look at it this way if a team player Recon were to team up with an engineer and use teamwork communication coordination and skill to properly placed down a soul flame in order to use a laser to desonate a helicopter to tell a rocket in mid-flight where to go to blow up a chopper to help stop the capturing force from taking the objective of Swing the tide of war in your favor the point both of those players combined wouldn't even approach half of what one Lone Wolf sniper can get from one single kill simply because he properly judged bullet drop one time out of the nine shots he probably took and this is inherently a problem with the scoring system giving that many points for one kill really makes doing anything else in Recon seem pointless and therefore we get Recons that do nothing else but snipe from the Caspian Tower it really inflates the importance of the Recon class because they can get just as many points as a hardworking team playing objective capturing assault class simply by getting five head shot on other stationary snipers he killed five people in one entire round that's like3 kills per minutes you really think he helped your team now yeah didn't think so and just let me say this I'm not saying that getting such long range kills does not take skill far from it it takes a really Steady Hand and or analog stick it is definitely a difficult skill to acheve aeve but in the confines of an objective based shooter compared to the skills of say capturing objectives working together and supporting your teammates so they can better defend or attack the objectives 800 met head shots is a pretty Superfluous skill it's like if your doctor told you well I can't do the surgery for you but I can fit 40 marshmallows in my mouth okay doc that's great but my appendix isn't going to remove itself okay that about wraps it up for today I've actually got much more to say than I thought about the Recon class so I'll be doing another Recon rant in the near future until then thanks for watching and please if you're playing Recon spot the enemies come into a reasonable distance and don't be a noob"

this video and go and watch the DC's Legends of Tomorrow trailer go watch it and then come back because seriously whether whatever Camp you're a part of be it Marvel or DC you're probably going to love this I mean I've watched it up to six or seven times now and I cannot even contain my excitement for this I mean I touched upon the like the synopsis for the for the show last week in my last u hnn news thing and I think Nick mentioned it before in one of his videos but seriously guys I I actually had a little hope for this and now my hopes just went through the freaking roof this trailer like I said I've watched it six or seven times or eight I don't know I lost count after like eight or seven but seriously guys this trailer oh my God oh my God oh my God oh my God oh my God I've never been this excited for a TV show on the CW no less this is the CW guys this is the same station that gives us like Jane the Virgin or or any of those other like you know tween garbage crap Fest piles I don't care but seriously guys I mean this this could be just as good if not better than the flash okay I mentioned it before I've never been excited for much DC stuff like I've mentioned before I'm not a big a big fan of like the Batman v Superman trailer that we got like I said I'm a little mixed on it I mentioned this like three or four times before but seriously guys by the look of this trailer you know what I I seriously think DC should consider just doing TV because if the flash is any indication and this this trailer DC might just have it made on the CW I never thought I'd say this never in a million Millennials did I think I would say this but DC Warner Brothers you guys just might have a win on the CW I mean who freaking knows but guys this trailer oh my God just wa I'm so hyped I'm so hyped I can't even think straight but yeah um like I mentioned before in the synopsis for the h&n news video from last week I mentioned the synopsis basically stated that a villain of some kind from some all powerful villain from the past or the future or something would come back and wreak havoc on the world and these group of superheroes would have to team up and stop him and it turns out that villain is none other than Vandal Savage so for those of you who don't know I only know a little bit on Vandal Savage because I think he was in the the Bruce Tim and paulini cartoons but he was also the main villain for Justice League Doom which is a great DC animated film I highly recomend recommend you go check it that out but basically Vandal Savage is a caveman who back in the you know early caveman days was affected by a radioactive meteorite and became highly intelligent and he lives in modern day and he's basically a rich powerful super villain and it looks like from the looks of this trailer he is going to go up against the the legends of tomorrow which consists of Captain Cold Heatwave Haw girl Firestorm white Canary I don't know why it's not black Canary white Canary I don't care which Canary just put Canary in there and the Flash and arrow and guys seriously I've never been this hyped for anything on the CW before aside from the flash I mean I said before

        "transcript": "how's it going thanks for coming out tonight I'm Todd I am the lead multiplayer designer everyone knows Robert I'm Robert bowling I'm the community manager so I'm sure you guys are anxious to get in there and start playing um we wanted to give you a quick overview of sort of the design Philosophy for Modern Warfare 2 um basically when we started working on it we didn't want to just make another sequel so we sort of stripped everything out started from scratch and just built a new game the game we wanted to play wanted to keep the heart and soul of the game so it's familiar but we wanted to make everything bigger better more options more accessible make you famous lots of customization so uh I'll go over a few of the the high points so one of the first things you'll notice in the new game is you can customize your killstreaks we call this killstreak rewards there's tons of these you'll see a few of them here in the beta um there's a new default set which if you're familiar with the with Call of Duty 4 then you'll know the first one is the three kill streak which is a UAV which shares the radar for your entire team um the second default is a four kill streak and it's called the care package and this adds a really big new mechanic to the game which you uh you have an airdrop marker when you get this kill streak you throw it out smoke goes up a helicopter drops in drops a crate and you're able to capture it and in that crate you're either going to get ammo or a random kill streak and they're all weighted so you know the the lower killstreaks are more common but you could possibly get an ac130 and start nuking people out of the sky and then the fifth killstreak is the predator missile and that is basically a remote control missile that you control you open up your laptop you're on the ground you got a few seconds to to see the bad guys and blow them up so there's a lot of different ways to play and a lot of these are unlockable you get to choose the order you unlock them to the new mechanic as well and there's there's a there's more than you'll see tonight but some good stuff another new thing that we added was the call sign you might have seen this in some of the videos that we released um basically the call sign is another way to show off how cool you are make yourself famous so you it shows your your game tag you have an emblem which is the symbol that you unlock and you have a title which is an image with some words so basically the way you play is the more things you do the more of these you're going to unlock for that thing so if you're like if you get really big into the riot shields you're going to unlock a lot of riot shield emblems and a lot of riot shield titles and you'll unlock some tonight you'll see what it's all about and it's a cool way to you know sort of personalize the game for yourself and when you do something cool in game these call signs pop out for everyone in the game so they know so if you shoot down the ac130 it's going to pop out says so and so shot down the ac130 show off your tiles things like that um we also evolved how creative class works so creative class is extremely big right now um there are a ton of new weapons ton of new attachments some new can and another new mechanic that we added was secondary weapons so not only do you choose your primary weapon you know your M16s or Famas but you also choose your secondary weapon which are also categorized also have attachments like machine pistols is an example they're rapid fire they're sort of like SMGs but a little weaker a little shorter range shotguns shotguns can have silencers now handguns for fast swapping they can have a lot of attachments and launchers like the at4 which can lock on to kill streaks so the ac130 is bothering you you can lock onto it shoot it down um another mechanic that we had was equipment so on your right bumper bur you may remember that you had a fragment in well now you can swap that out and decide what you want in his place we have seen 402 get stuck by a SX grenade in one of the videos and hit in the face with a throwing knife hit in the face with a throwing knife there's also tactical Insertion which is a something it doesn't actually kill you're able to throw this down and it determines where your next F will be with a blast Shield which protects you from explosions but you lose your mini map all these are really cool cuz there just more and more ways to customize to your play style I mean I love using tactical Insertion when I'm playing CTF cuz as I get closer to the flag I'm constantly dropping them down so when I'm going to do the mad rush I'm pretty sure I'm going to die I can always spawn back without running all the way across the M same with the kill streaks of I use them I typically have a load out that is uh per game type so just like in my CTF class I'll have tactical Insertion in my equipment slot I will also customize my kill streaks around that because I want something that's fast and effective if I'm playing objective game type where if I'm playing something like TDM and it's all about kills and I want something that Cher control that I can get up there and be in control of right another good thing to note about all this stuff is we have two basic philosophies that we incorporate into everything we're adding into the game so we have to make sure it's fun which is obvious and we also make sure that it's balanced and there are counters to it and there are ways that this isn't the thing that's going to break the game so if you see that guy that's using a tactical Insertion you're actually able to go up and break it you can shoot it you can make it blow up or you can wait behind it wait for the guy to spawn and then shoot him in the back and there's all these different balances that that you'll see when you play the game like try off the riot shield when you're when you're next door playing and you'll you'll see that you can't shoot when you have the r Shield out and it's slow to swamp but block bullets so it's it's really cool um there's a lot of new perks perks going to upgrade now the more you use the perks much like the weapons last game they upgrade so you can take your uh hard line which is get a kill streak for one less kill if you're giving up your slopping power and you can make your death streaks pointless so um for example a death streak it's also a New Concept that you choose per class cop cat is a good example so basically once you died four times in a row you know you might be a little bummed you might be having a a bad go but you get your copycat and you're able to steal the the guy that killed you his class during his kill Camp so you can say this guy just keeps killing me so annoying I'm going just steal his stuff and get a preview of things she inl later so that's that's a little bit of create a class and you can name them of course just fun here"

        "transcript": "hey everyone welcome to another gear blocks update this time I'll be talking about the new spring dampers in the game the spring dampers are made out of two parts that have to be fitted together and they come in two sizes a smaller and a larger you know the spring dampers are attached to the rest of your construction using axles and the axles can be attached either using a hinge or a rigid attachment the two parts of the spring damper can be attached in different orientations like that so you can have the axles at 90 degrees if you want once the spring damper is unfrozen you can see it'll extend as the spring pushes it the two parts apart like that the two parts the spring damper Esha attached at the midpoint along their range of motion so in this case it can move one unit in that way and one unit out that way there's a larger spring damper that has a greater range of movement so in this case it can move two units in and two units out okay so let's have a look at these parts on a couple of examples so first off here's a simple test bed with a swing arm and a weight that we're going to use to compress the spring so let's attach that like that so once I'm frozen you can see the spring is now pushing the arm up and it's under compression from the weight pulling it down now by hovering over the spring damper and holding shift and E you can bring up the part behavior dialog and adjust the spring rate and damping so if I bring the spring rate down you can see that the arm sinks down because there's less force in the spring pushing it up and I can increase it as well to make it more stiffly sprung as well I can adjust the damping so if I bring that all the way down you can see becomes very very bouncy and I can push it all the way up you see the motor movements now very stiff and actually when it's released it takes a little time to be pushed up by the spring because the damping is kind of holding it back the largest spring damper not only has a greater range of movement but it also has higher spring and damping rates so it starts at a higher default and can go up to twice the values that the smaller one can and one last thing to mention is that the spring rate can be reduced all the way down to zero and then the spring damper becomes just purely a damper so you can see there's no spring force anymore but it just lets the weight down gently okay so let's have a look at this on a simple vehicle so here we have a couple of uprights that move up and down that are attached to the chassis with these swing arms that let the suspension move up and down and the spring damper is attached rigidly to the rest of the upright to stop things flopping around I've just implemented steering using a couple of servos like this just to keep things simple otherwise you'd have a bunch of linkages and stuff as well I just want to keep things simple this this example the rear we just have a solid swing arm pretty much as simple as you can get really but you can see it works pretty well and you can see the vehicle riding on the suspension and kind of compressing it down like that now when you're adjusting the suspension for your vehicle you typically want to have the the suspension give you a kind of one down up motion is kind of what you're after rather than it bouncing around all over the place and you also typically want to have the spring rate and damping at roughly the same value seems to give good behavior but you know you can play around with it as you want as I say this is a very simple suspension geometry you can build all sorts of kind of different kinds of suspension yeah and I can't say weights to what you guys build with these new parts but yeah that's it for this time thanks for watching"

        "transcript": "hey guys jay up here and welcome back to more minecraft now in the previous episode i really didn't get much done i was mainly remodeling and mining down in the mine to try to get more resources so i could continue to build things but since the previous episode i've gotten a lot done i've built a couple more structures and i think you're going to actually like it so let's get started now the first thing i've done is i went into the tree farm and changed it out i know those trees over there the normal trees typically grow out of hand and i got sick of burning them down and risking the chance of lighting this house on fire which i have done once already and i'm glad that i didn't save it i was able to kind of crash it and then restore it because it would take a lot of work to have to fix this house after it burned down so i changed them to the white trees now i don't have to use flint steel and burn down the excess because they're not going to grow out of hand they will grow taller and which is a good thing but i'm going to use this mainly for wood the other trees if i want to build taller i might create another tree farm somewhere else with those trees that way if they get big and bushy and i light them on fire i don't have to risk burning this down but also you can see by now i have had fun with tnt what i wanted to do was demolish a good bit of this hill that way i could start building more things on flat land i know over there i've created a lot of flat land which is a good thing i mean i have built some more structures over there as you saw there's a partial structure that i have built already i really want to create a lot more things and this is where you all come into play now i want you to leave a comment down below and mention some things you might want to see built if y'all are good at pixel art i might actually invite you onto the server and let you build something i have a lot of wool and i'm getting more and more every time i play this game because apparently the sheep are spawning in great numbers and they're spawning consistently so i can kill them non-stop but let's go ahead and see what else i've done since the previous episode i finally decided to build a bridge i got sick of crossing this river it taking a long time because you usually get in here and then you have to swim and it just takes forever so what i decided to do was build a bridge and i think i did this last night just before i got off and i built it out of wood and which that tree farm came and helped because i cut all that down and was able to build this easily and then i added in glass that way light could get through the bridge to the underside because i really don't know if mobs can spawn in water i'm pretty sure they can't but just in case i decided to put the glass in so the light can get through but this is the main thing that i wanted to show off that i built since the previous episode the first thing i ever did in minecraft was i built a pyramid and i thought it was awesome so i decided to finally do it i had more sand than i needed so i converted it all to sandstone and then built this double pyramid and then i connected the two pyramids with sandstone columns which look pretty cool and i'm kind of happy how it turned out now the flooring here still needs some work done on it you can leave a comment down below what you want me to change it to i've got enough wool that i can change it into a blue carpet i can do more red carpet if that's what you want to see or can just turn into a sandstone floor but i plan on changing this out soon that way it'll look nice but go ahead and go up to the top of the pyramid or at least the top of the second pyramid and see what i've done with it so far now what you can see is i'm probably going to turn this into a chest room you can already notice that there's a lot of chests in here as of right now i started to dump all my cobblestone because when you mine you kind of build up a lot of cobblestone and it takes up a lot of room and up in the top of my house my chest was full of cobblestone so i'm gonna go ahead and start shifting things over when one of the chests start fill up i'm gonna go ahead and start using this as my chest room when i have excess of materials but that's mainly all i've done since the previous episode it actually took a lot of work to do so i'm kind of happy with the results i'm gonna start using the bridge a whole lot more often and i'm gonna use this as storage area i might start building minecart tracks to get from underground from place to place because i know there's big cave systems i need to connect that's pretty much all that i have to show off this episode of the double pyramid and the bridge that i built now two videos you may have missed the one on the left is an a12 mob on mission with and i thought this gun was pretty bad but it turned out to be one of the better guns in the game now the video on the right is my silent spaz mob one of the viewers decided to challenge me to get a pump action shotgun mob so i went out and did it and i found a setup that was pretty good twitter links will be in

        "transcript": "Spider-man has some pretty sweet abilities, but let us take a scientific look to see how well this superhero\nstacks up to reality. For spider-man to become genetically modified, the spider that\nbit him would have to release a retrovirus into his body. Retrovirus carry genetic information which\ngets inserted into the DNA of cells. The cell then reads the new DNA to create specific\nfunctions and proteins for that cell. But this retrovirus would have to make its way to nearly every cell and have the ability to code for new\nand different functions in each cell. So while it is theoretically possible,\nit would also be pretty \"amazing\". Silk, it is actually proportionately stronger\nand more flexible than steel. Spiderwebs 1/10th the size of a piece of hair\nare able to catch insects flying upwards of 15 miles an hour. And, believe it or not, if a web were an inch thick in diameter\nit could actually stop a fighter jet. Strength, some spiders can lift up to 50 times their body weight, this muscle strength\nis directly related to size. Think about your biceps, when you work out it increases\nin height and width, but not length. In this way, the strength of an organism increases\nas a square, or by 2 on the scale factor. But as organisms get bigger, their volume increases by\nheight, width and length, as a cube, or a 3 on the scale factor. This creates a ratio of 2:3,\nmeaning the bigger the organism, the smaller its proportional strength. But because Spider-man is human shaped and sized, the retorvirus would have to encode for the creation of more\nactin and myosin proteins. These proteins effect the contraction abilities of muscles,\nand in effect could make a human stronger. Climbing walls? Not a problem for spiders, they have tiny hairs on each leg and these hairs have tons of even smaller\nhairs with triangular ends which interact within nanometers of the atoms on the surface. This creates electrostatic forces, allowing them to stick with \nstrength of 170 times their own weight. Too capture this ability, Spider-man would need permanently\nhairy hands and feet, which may not overly impress his damsels in distress. And finally, what about the Spidey Sense? Well, spider hairs are extremely sensitive\nto vibration and air pressure changes. But this means that spider-man could\nonly perceive things that are near him, and not events at a distance. Got a burning question you want answered? Ask it in the comments, or on facebook and twitter, and subscribe for\nweekly science videos."

        "transcript": "welcome to E39 Source Ryan Schultz here with the 200 M5 little bit of a different video today a little bit more relaxed I'm actually on my way down to Dave Walter excuse me BMW in akan Ohio taking a 2005 um to actually buy as you saw by the video titles or title those little knobs that go on your 16x9 display um kind of a weak point for a video but I have seen on The Forum some people talk about finding the right part number for these knobs and they wear out if you guys remember just a week or two or three ago I put the 16x9 navigation display in this car obviously it's a 2000 so it came with the little one but now this is in here and it's time to replace the knobs on here they're probably original they're scratched up they're scuffed up they don't look nice so we'll talk about those part numbers in a little bit but kind of like I did to Detroit we'll film a little bit of the trip down there if there's any nice cars at Dave Walter we'll film that and then I'll give you some part numbers and insight on replacing the knobs themselves it is about 3:00 on March 7th I believe or 8th 2013 over here it's March 8th 323 and it's a balmy 41\u00b0 outside in Ohio it's just lovely the city of Hudson is usually a first gear City because traffic generally looks like this here we come South on Route 91 just downtown the temperatures already decreased to 36\u00b0 guess we will make this light generally there's nice cars in Hudson I don't think that's going to be the case today being a Friday and being cold and cloudy as it usually is for eight months out of the Year here I missed it but there was a ml63 AMG if that's your style or there's an A6 our sister city lansburg lonin is 5,154 MIL that way we are approaching Route 8 which will take me North to Cleveland or South to akan we'll go south to akan to Dave Walter BMW that's my street Perkins Street next straight which means I got to move over in this traffic which is horrible for some reason this is the city of akan we'll get a better view in a minute it's it's quite the place to be that guy's been on my ass the whole time 75 and 55 look quite good enough for him here's what we get dirty Bridges dirty buildings of First Merit Bank and over to West Exchange Street for DW BMW here we are E39 and an X1 out front couple f10s over here 550 M package looks like even know if I can find a place to park around here there an M3 we'll park next to the c46 coupe look at these ches who do they think they are this is a BMW dealership you can't tell or not could be a B7 just picked up my parts we'll take a look well shaky camera work it's getting cool but e92 M3 we'll take a quick glance while we're here you know me see if it's oh it's an E93 with an SMG uh I did notice a couple cars of Interest over here I'll take a little walk that white seven Series in there that's LeBron James 760 LI obviously he's in Miami but his friends brought his car and I was just talking to my service guy so that's that's LeBron's car M3 M3 M6 M5 M6 750 m6 and M6 there quite a few M cars here I looked at them when I was in here last week when I ordered these parts and every single one of them is a dual clutch SMG whatever this is that Valencia orange I want to say convertible soft top with already some bird crap on it if you haven't seen the F12 and I think f11 I'm sixes there they are the seven series that was sitting idling last week E63 m6 and the F10 M5 possibly making its first appearance on E39 Source an F10 with a red interior and the m6 again with sleeved exhaust my biggest problem with these cars and SM 3s notice the certified pre-owned lot across the street is packed all the way to the back there are cars everywhere I just talked with one of the salesmen and in there and uh they're excited for spring but they need to start selling cars I've never seen them so busy and the only other E39 I found here is a facelifted 530 with a 5-speed automatic from back inside the car still at the dealership actually I'm just going to show you real quick how these knobs go back in part number 65528 385 458 they're both the same on the 16 to9 ratio display on the 4x3 uh there were different sizes my blaz is a little bit dirty I apologize for that but I did order two of them the total part cost was I believe $25.45 I'm going to need two hands to open this in a minute but the old Parts come off very simply we'll do the volume knob first pretty much grab a hold of it as far back towards the buttons as you can pry it out pull a little bit and there it is reinstallation is going to be the same process notice the flat part in the bottom of that Circle will align with a flat part in the actual knob in there line it up up and press and I'll show you what the new part looks like in just a moment a little bit of pressing and there we go good as new they feel a little bit better they're not as nicked up as the old ones were the old ones aren't too bad but it is a minor Improvement takes a little bit more than I thought to actually line it up give it a firm press and you're all [Music] set the sun is out it's up to 40\u00b0 again and it actually dropped the 36 of acan anyhow in this Lane over here which I can barely see going south I'm now going north back to Hudson a great green Porsche Carrera GT in the uh the far left lane the far right from this perspective of the highway goes flying down there at least 120 mph never seen a bright green Carrera GT before I guess the guy's out having some fun thing had a huge spoiler on the back wish I were filming very cool welcome back we're home everything's done that hood Gap doesn't look right it's because it's not I just popped the hood I'm going to top off the oil it asked me to do that so I will anyways though Sun actually did come out a little bit it did not look like that when I left and it's probably only been about an hour and a half so I'm thinking I may pull some Zeno out just go over the car real quick it's fairly clean aside from a little bit of salt dust which we can see down here on the rocker if that will focus for me yeah see if we can take care of that if the Sun stays out and it doesn't go much below the temperature it is now it won't be too bad to work on it so this is a little update today with those knobs and whatnot I had to order a new light back here in the trunk because the one that is up here got broken so we ordered that it was $17 I don't anticipate doing a video there's the wire for it it's really simple all right the Zeno turned out pretty well we just did an even coat over the body work with the Z6 um really just to expose a lot of the work that I want to do or need to do now that winter is about over there's a lot of imperfections little pieces of rust that have come out in the clear coat um little couple pieces of tar clay bar will take a lot of this off last year I did it with pressure and soap and that was miserable so this year I'll use sayos clay bar but it looks pretty decent just a little update here with the car if you like this style video uh a little bit less a little bit more relaxed I should say a little bit of driving got those parts installed that's a nice Improvement inside uh let me know spring is here and we'll be doing more with the car I did get new M5 carpet floor mats that will be going in when these rubber ones come out and I definitely look forward to that so that's going to be it for this video guys thanks so much for watching subscribe if you like the channel and the content much more to come I guarantee it I'll talk to you guys later bye"

(upbeat music) - One of the things that is really unique about the Monterey Bay Acquarium is first of all our location. We like to say the ocean is our largest exhibit here. Everything you see inside are the habitats that you would see if\nyou were to go diving right out here a few feet off our decks. (upbeat music) - Whoa! I'm like right underneath the shark. (mellow music) Wow, look, I found Nemo. I can't believe how colorful the coral is. It's brilliant, so vibrant. The aquarium doesn't only feature what lives under the water in the bay. You'll also find the birds which live in the sky and on the shore. I think my favorite is the\none with the orange legs, the black neck stilt. (upbeat music) Whoa! So many of the creatures have to deal with the rushing water crashing\nagainst the shore. Wow. Hey, buddy. A lot of the creatures\nhere, like the otter, have been rescued, and they\nnow call this place home because they wouldn't survive in the wild. - Look at that one. He came to see you. - Oh, cool! It's really neat that they\nhave these touch pools so that you can actually\nget right in there and interact with the animals. It's called a decorator crab because it attaches things to its back. Move along, little fella. Have a good day. - Whenever our guests\ncome to the aquarium, they leave feeling inspired and want to do something for the animals and the world's oceans. They're going to leave feeling that emotional connection with all of our animals on exhibit here. - I have had such a fantastic\nday here at the aquarium learning about all the different creatures that live in the bay, and seeing the world\nfrom their perspective. The Monterey Bay Aquarium\ncannot be missed. (upbeat music)"

trees with no interruptions no power lines absolutely gorgeous okay I've been getting questions about juicing and smoothies there's some raw gurus out there saying that smoothies are bad because you oxidize the Smoothie because of the blade and the air getting sucked in the vortex so therefore you should do juices well if you're putting like peanut butter and a banana and some yogurt in your smoothie yeah it's going to oxidize it's going to be rancid crap and I definitely would not drink that but if you put in Gale and spinach and beet greens and blueberries and other super antioxid an Rich fruits and vegetables what do you think is going to happen antioxidant stops oxidation it's one of the reasons we eat these Foods because of their antioxidant content so putting antioxidant rich foods in the blender is going to stop them from oxidizing okay juices one of the problems I have with juices is you're removing the fiber fiber is an essential nutrient cuz it allows for proper colon function not just cleaning the colon out but the soluble fiber that actually feeds the bacteria the cultures living in your colon the probiotics okay these fibers feed them and they're called prebiotics the fiber is actually called a Prebiotic but it's really just soluble fiber which is like the meat of an apple the meat of a banana that's soluble fiber well this fiber when it's eaten by the bacteria releases acetic acid butc acid other short chain fatty acids yes vinegar is a fat it's a very very very short chain fat with only one carbon most fats have 12 to 24 carbons uh vinegar is the super short chain in fact this the shortest well it's used as energy cuz fat is an energy source the walls of your colon use those short chain fats released from the breakdown of fiber by bacteria you're not breaking them down your bacteria are and they provide energy for the walls of the colon so it can contract so it can have proper peristalsis okay so fiber is essential when you have juices when you're on a juice Feast you're getting rid of all the fiber secondly if you putting apples carrots anything sweet beets in your juice you're upping your blood sugar big time because fiber regulates sugar absorption so uh if you're doing juices with sweet fruits or vegetables you're getting an insulin Spike which is not good for you uh for smoothies all the fiber is still there it's been beat up but it's still there so you're slowing down the absorption of the sugar and it's so much cleaner burn no insulin Spike so me smoothies but throwing a lot of antioxidant Rich fruits vegetables and greens then you don't have to worry about them oxidizing okay oh it's hard to film talk and run up a mountain at the same time getting a lot of comments from people that are telling me that I'm Really Brave for speaking my truth and putting myself out there and I ask I ask you this why should it require bravery to speak your truth what kind of culture have we created where being truthful requires bravery like what systems are in place that are going to punish us for being truthful we say it's a free country and we have free speech so then why are we so afraid to speak the truth are we really as free as we think we are we say those words all the time it's free country is it it's really easy to to judge when you're in a comfortable place and say just relax Tim go with the flow you know why are you fighting why are you resistant go with the flow well sometimes that flow is leading you over Niagara Falls and you better swim and you better fight and you better bust your butt and you better resist that current cuz it's going to kill you all right sometimes you get into a flow you get into a current that's taking you in the wrong direction and that current is Swift and you better fight back you can't always go with the flow okay that advice is for people living in a vacuum nobody lives in a vacuum all right people say just just be peaceful just Bliss out well guess what while you're all blist out in your heated apartment with nice cushy couch and your laptop on your lap and a big screen TV that you're watching the latest documentary you know Forks Over Knives on they're people busting their butts to make that TV for you to make that laptop for you to put the to take the oil out of the earth to heat your apartment somebody built that couch somebody built your apartment and you're saying oh just peace and love yeah on the backs of how many people before you judge think about all the people that have allowed you to have a peaceful life think about the millions of people around the world who don't have what you have before you judge me before you judge the people that work hard before you judge the people that fight hard think about all the people that are fighting for you that you've never even seen gratitude I'm grateful for everything that I have in my life for the person that made this jacket that made my gloves that made my clothes that made my computer that made the running shoes that are getting me up the mountain I'm grateful every day because I know they're fighting too I know their lives are not easy okay and when I fight I honor them as well so don't tell me to Bliss out don't tell me to just go with the flow because the flow that I'm in is going to kill me I'm going against the flow baby I'm creating my own flow I'm creating my own current I'm creating Eddies I'm creating a storm in that water I'm going upstream and I got a paddle and I built it it's made out of Blood Sweat and [Applause] Tears here we are at the summit was actually 4.8 miles to the summit so this stuff at the bottom to get up to the trail adds a little bit so it's going to be a 9.6 mile run I'm on top of the mountain I'm on top of the world I'm the highest person in Bennington right now no comment about that and uh yeah I did it it's over it's all downhill from here now I get to Coast now I get to use gravity to pull me down the hill see you tomorrow [Music]"

        "transcript": "hello everybody Marco chiappetta for hot hardware here over the past few months we've shown you quite a few sneak peeks at AMD's Maui home theater PC platform if you're unfamiliar with Maui it's basically a combination of AMD processor chipsets graphics and peripherals in combination with AMD live software components assembled in a compact home theater PC form factor at the heart of the platform is an MSI motherboard that features d2 audio technology that can be configured with either a 5.1 amplifier or up to a 7.1 channel preamp you've got to see this thing it's pretty cool check it out our MD Maui home theater PC came assembled in this slick and media pc enclosure as you can see the most dominant feature on the front of this case is this readout right here this weed out can display various information like PC health data for example or information about media being accessed through windows media center edition just above the display is this drive bay we've got a blu-ray drive in this system here and at the bottom is a full down panel and behind it you can see a USB port built-in flash card reader firewire port a couple more USB ports and eSATA port and headphone and microphone jacks just above them or the power and reset switches there's lots of stuff to see on the back of the AMD Maui home theater PC here's a standard ATX power supply in a couple of cooling fans that came with the end media pc enclosure that was used in the i/o backplane you have HD component output db15 VGA output spdif inputs and outputs and an hdmi output with audio we should note that that hdmi output can also be adapted to DVI using an included dongle just next to that or a few USB ports al and Jack firewire port and to the right of that are various analog audio inputs and outputs next you can see the cable and antenna inputs on the AMD theater 650 card and to the right of that is something new what this is is a connector block that allow you to wire up speakers directly to the amplifier that's built in to the MSI motherboard using this system more on that next there's a lot going on inside our AMD Maui home theater PC I thought we'd point out a few of the more common components first ones that you're likely to have seen before first we have AMD's theater 650 TV tuner card here we've covered that on hot hardware quite a few times in the past here you have a standard SATA seagate hard drive aceite blu-ray player and here we have a high-efficiency corsair 450 watt psu we should point out that this system consumes about 70 watts while idling and under load it can consume about a hundred to 115 wats depending on what you're doing with the system here is a standard ddr2 RAM used in the MD Maui home theater PC but next to it is something you may not have seen before cooling the AMD phenom x4 9350 ecp you powering this system is a low-profile silent flux cpu cooler this cooler is interesting and that it uses an evaporator chamber and tubes filled with liquid coolant to cool the CPU as the liquid and the evaporator chamber is heated it runs through the tubes then through this radiator where it's cooled and the cycle completes again does a very good job cooling this low-power cpu and works fine without a dedicated fan mounted to it with a higher-end cpu that probably wouldn't be the case but here it works quite well our AMD Maui home theater PC is built upon MSI's media live diva 5.1 motherboard this motherboard uses aim these 780m chipset which features an integrated dx10 Radeon graphics core we should also note that the graphics core built in here can offload much of the HD video processing duties from the host CPU to smooth playback what makes the board more interesting though is the integrated inter-cell d to audio da three chip that's on board that sound chip works in conjunction with this card here which is probably something you haven't seen before what that is is basically a built-in 100 watt 4 channel 5.1 amplifier if you want to use standard speakers that are not amplified with this rig like you would use in many home theater setups there's no need to have a separate amplifier if you prefer to use a higher-end amp however a 7.1 channel preamp card is also available as an option one of the beauties of AMD's Maui home theater PC platform is the seamless integration of AMD hardware and MD live software components with Windows Media Center we've got a few of the apps running now and are going to show them to you here first up is AMD's live Explorer this application give users easy access to various on demand media that's either stored on the web or on the user's pc you can also access locally stored photos music video and television right from one interface other live components show up on the right it's within windows media center that a lot of the excitement happens though so we're going to show you that now if you're unfamiliar with media center it's basically a 10-foot interface that runs on top of Windows that lets users control their pc using a remote control here you see the menu running on the AMD Mallory PC since our system is equipped with an AMD theater 650 TV card we thought you show you some live TV right in action just give it a moment for the app to load the ante woman's value this team in this chase impressing congratulations you want to give you a couple minutes to celebrate with your team as you can see it works just like any other set-top box you pick your channel you hit enter and it's going to take you right there in addition while you're watching TV you can even switch to other apps you can see the TV continues to play in the background there next we're going to move on to some blu-ray playback using arcsoft totalmedia we've got a casino royale blu-ray disc in the drive right now just give it a moment the apps going to load and you'll see how the machine plays back full 1080p content now blu-ray discs do take a few seconds to load that's why you saw that delay there let's turn up the volume once again so you can hear the audio as you can see perfectly smooth video playback let's bring up task manager and see how the system is being text so even with a full high def blu-ray disc playing if you're looking at only thirty five to thirty six percent max CPU utilization with an AMD phenom quad core on the rig that's obviously going to go a little higher if you've got a a dual-core in there we hope you've enjoyed this look at aim these Maui home theater PC platform once again this is Marco chiappetta for hot hardware thanks for stopping by"

built a house and what people do here as you can see right here is build houses on the hillside and then they get a panoramic view of the valley below right now we're in completely away from the valley and you can see how these houses are stacked into the hillside on the West Mesa as we move on around and pan some of these homes that are built on that hillside as we swing around we're actually to the north west right now and we will continue on around until we pick up in the background will be Picacho Mountain should be coming in right about now that's Picacho Mountain and it's about four miles away at this time on the left side of that is coronado ridge the gated community and then there's Butterfield Ridge about the middle another gated community actually there's Picacho Mountain up sort of to the left upper part of the of the lower part of the mountain and then there's Picacho Hills Country Club and sort of goes through that in Picacho Hills itself is right there as we swing on around a little bit further we have a house of a unique individual here in town Delano and Gale Lewis he is a Washington based attorney and he was then pointed by Bill Clinton to be the ambassador to South Africa and now he has left that role he's still connected in Washington and he's also quite connected as an attorney here in town and he isn't his wife are real active in things like the symphony and things of that nature as we continue on around we begin to pick up down in the lower part here what's known as raw soft hills and that's just the start of raw soft hills but more importantly we're looking up the the Rio Grande Valley right now and that goes up clear up to Elephant Butte and it's mostly pecan groves for you know 50 75 miles that's the second of seven mountain ranges in the background as we swing on around with raw soft hills beginning to pick up in the lower part of the picture as we continue on around here there's a mountain right there a small mountain I really don't know the name of it but the significant thing about that is that just to the right side of that is where the new Las Cruces Country Club is located hasn't they haven't got it in operation yet but the Golf Course is built and there again we're now off to on the north part of Las Cruces and we're looking right out at I 70 going out to the north east and if we went through the past we would come down on the White Sands proving ground old six or seven miles outside of town through the pass and beyond that it would be up to Alamogordo and or Rio doe so a little bit further and the all of the things associated with Rio dough so as well as a great skiing area so there's really good skiing just a little over an hour away as we swing on around some more we're beginning to pick up just north Las Cruces but also down below here is the main part of Ross off hills it's located on the first of three ridges and most houses are on actually on the other side of the ridge because they all want that precious view as you're seeing right now so at any rate that's the homes as they're sort of stacked like in the Hollywood Hills of Ross off hills and then looking in the background those mountains are about 16 miles away and right now you're looking at downtown versus and as we move on we will be swinging directly to the east and right there I believe is what's called a mountain and it's called a mountain because it's got a great big a on the top of it I think you can see it there and the reason for the a on the top of it is because we got the Aggies New Mexico State Aggies just below about where you're looking at right now and if you look off to the right way over on the other side you can see some homes up there along the mountain and those homes are stacked right up close to the mountains because they have a great view up there now we will continue on to the south part of Las Cruces and as we would move into the foreground there that area that looks like hay or farm land is a new state park and it's actually quite a large state park and then right behind that you can get a really good shot of the pecan groves and they go up and down the valley that's the main crop here and of course they're having a record year this year for prices an all-time high for pecan it's almost twice what they were last year then as we move on we can see how the Rio Grande River snakes down towards towards uh there's a little better shot of it down towards El Paso and the US border and US Mexican border and then there in the foreground is Mesilla hills and Mesilla hills is a very unique place in that the homes are very high-end more towards the million dollar mark and in addition to that they're on three to five acres most the Lots are at least three and many or five even a few six acre lots and another really popular feature of that area is the fact that they have very relaxed POA standards people do not like real tight property owners associations today because they just virtually all get out of control by do-gooders who want to protect property values and they essentially end up wrecking them so that's very relaxed there and lots of lots can be easily sold in there because of that and then as we move on we pick up the the seventh mountain range of the seven mountain ranges in the area and we're almost directly south and if you went over that Ridge and continued on about another 40 to 45 miles you'd be right in the heart of El Paso Texas so that's your view here today of what you could expect if you build a home here on the West Mesa and this would be the kind of view you would have left right and center it's pretty spectacular that's the end of the tour for today"

you know in this gameplay they leaked a few um changes in the title update and i'm going to tell you about those but we'll get to that when we actually get to those parts in the video so you know stay tuned i had about that [\u00a0__\u00a0] and anyways um let's tell you a little bit about my vacation why we were you know live i wasn't posting videos and so i went to florida for like a week or so visit my aunt and i was flying spirit air and you know um if you ever been on spirit it's basically the shittiest airline in the entire world anyways so for we get there it's an hour delay because of pranks it was like the brainiest [\u00a0__\u00a0] day ever and um anyways we get there to board and they're like okay there's a flat tire you gotta wait another hour so we wait we get there again another 20 minutes overall it takes four hours to change a [\u00a0__\u00a0] flat tire anyways um let's keep going on you sit on the plane i fall asleep i wake up we're still in the plane like what the hell did i fall asleep like five minutes or something nope i've been asleep for a [\u00a0__\u00a0] hour and a half so you know overall we had like a six and a half hour like some [\u00a0__\u00a0] airline can't fix the flat tire um moving on i ordered a couple noodles later on and they did not have forks or spoons i was sitting there eating the noodles with my hands looking kind of like a [\u00a0__\u00a0] maybe sad all right next next thing i get to florida you know my uncle pushes me and pulls a joke that's good for me because my iphone and my ipod and my android phone are in my pocket and they both break you know two of them no big deal i'm getting an i5 anyways then my left trigger and my controller broke i got to get a new one of those piss me off anyways yeah that's really kind of the patch that happened to me but it was pretty fun overall um another thing this weekend i'm hoping if i can to recover these files on my broken computer um yeah and i'm trying to make a very short usually worth three months i didn't get very many clips from the beta because it didn't play that much or yeah so that's that all right so i think in about a little pretty soon there should be first thing i want to talk about that'll update and you know there's also a beaver creek trailer you can check that out i don't think there's a fly through gameplay nothing that jump looked like you probably might should have taken fall damage i'm not 100 sure so you know i old image might be out but you know i don't know because i it's not like i obviously jumped like oh yeah that's definitely i couldn't really tell with that so yeah oh here here's the first one now you watch watch closely he's going to put some shots into this guy with a second right here and he punches him that was a equivalent of three shots and they got shield with the dmr and then he punches him so as you can see there the bleed through melee effect is back and um in just a second he's gonna do another thing i think no maybe not i was wrong guys all right anyways yeah this is beaverclip freak and then there's this one this one has a fly-through trailer and gameplay and i think after this guy dies next life is gonna be um next thing okay so pretty sure it's about to happen right here maybe not yeah whatever anyways it'll happen if he kills this guy and you don't see the pistol gameplay which kind of makes me sad but you know to pick up this d minor now watch closely he's going to shoot and there's no balloon no cursor there that's when he reloads um there's no bloom which is really awesome so yeah you can watch more of that in the video but next thing is armor lock now watch it very closely when he goes in the armor lock you see he gets damaged and like he loses he loses energy he loses energy so i guess when you get shot if you buy a grenade by armor lock you um you lose energy instead of taking damage arm lock is still in it looks like but they've made it basically powerless they're grenades someone two grenades there i don't know we've got like five guys in the team shoot him and he's like [\u00a0__\u00a0] but anyways that's it for this video um i'll let you watch the rest of the gameplay and i'll just talk about some other [\u00a0__\u00a0] but no more changes i noticed besides that when he gets hit by grenades it looks like they might not do as much damage but i can't confirm that along with the new fall damage thing yeah i'll let you guys kind of decipher that for yourself i'm sure at halo fest we'll hear more [\u00a0__\u00a0] so unless this was an accident i don't think they would leak like three big things like this um and not like have anything left for halo fest and they got to have some other stuff up their sleeve hopefully that'll be good things too i'm one thing i'm sure will come back is no vehicle damage so i'm expecting to hear about that anyways guys that's really it for stuff in this video uh the map is pretty cool and another thing if you haven't read already the maps they all have variants like this map has this one and there's another one called i think pennants which is just like more tunnels and rooms and [\u00a0__\u00a0] so i guess just touch me like six small 12 multiplayer maps shipping anyways guys thanks for watching please comment rate subscribe and do all that good stuff and have a great day"

        "transcript": "Cambodia a country rich in ancient tradition and natural beauty including large areas of forest but illegal logging compounded with the excessive fuel consumption means the forests of Cambodia are going up in smoke the Cambodia fuel with saving project CF SP aims to curb the rampant deforestation a key part of the work is reduced demand for charcoal through the use of an improved fuel efficient stove the main cause of deforestation is basically combination between silikal looking and the charcoal production in 96 27 I passed this this area and this area was forest I didn't know what happened during the last ten years but I presumably this because of the logging and also because of this charcoal production people cut the trees and then they make charcoal and then as you can see is no more forest here the consumption in the in the urban areas is quite high it is about ninety thousand ton only for the Phnom Penh city per year and they do not use the efficient device to cook currently there is no realistic alternative to charcoal for cooking so CF SP have redesigned the traditional stove making it more efficient and cutting the amount of charcoal used by 22% most of the families day they use this stove we consider it as a traditional stove then based on this we introduce new design adopted from Thailand this is combustion chamber we forced to make this smaller so then you cannot put big quantity of charcoal we make the great with 37 holes distributed evenly so then distribution of the air gives you better combustion the metal cover is up to the top of the edge of the stove then it is more durable stronger and we put a refractory liner made of rice husk s mix with clay so the heat here will be reflecting a packet inside this insulator is made of ice hast s in order to prevent the heat loss from the combustion chamber traditional stoves have been popular in Cambodia for many years CF SP has taken a bunch of this existing driving market to introduce the improved stove we claim the producers on how to produce a new design how to manage the improves of production how to do the quality control and we gather all of the producers and distributors into an association the new stove cost three times the price of the traditional stove but the consumers understand the advantages and savings outweigh the additional cost the traditional stove is much cheaper but uses a lot more fuel one kilogram of charcoal which additional stove lost only two days but with my new stove may last 3 to 4 days not only does it save charcoal but it cooks faster and is more durable it is more expensive costs 20 thousand reals but lasts much longer ensuring that the stoves are popular with the users and that stove production can generate a profit for small-scale businesses it's critical for the long-term success of the project the main objective of CF has been promoting improved stuff through commercialization is that we want to reduce the consumption of food the second is that we want this dissemination program running in sustainable way stuff producers prefer to produce the improved stove simply because we got more profit also the retailer and the middleman also enjoyed the same profit as the producers I believe that this if we can maintain this condition then the commercialization of new stove in Cambodia will going on self without any support from from the project hey Jackie I love my little bit I can get more income now about three times more than with the traditional stove well you come with that oh yeah I'm one with poop lady dallona before I had a small house know I'm able to build a bigger house I can repair this house and have a better living condition"

        "transcript": "iOS 6 and iOS 6.0.1 using snowbreeze 2.9.6 on windows so just load it up here you can download it from our download section on I download blog again this is for pre A5 devices like the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 3GS it is a tether jailbreak so go ahead and open it select browse for ipsw browse for your firmware here is my iOS 6.0.1 firmware it recognizes it iPhone 4 GSM now there are quite a few options in this list here U but we're just going to stick with the simple mode for just the normal tethered jailbreak with our iPhone 4 so I'm going to show you how to use that there's some other modes there you can search I download blog for more information on that so yes we want to go ahead and activate our phone and then just select no thanks here um I'm going to speed this up significantly this usually takes quite a while so as you can see a little spinny icon is going really fast because I've sped it up for the video so you guys aren't waiting all day on me all right this should finish momentarily just a few more seconds okay creating an ipsw all right now just so I can show you guys here's my iPhone 4 it's hooked up to my computer it is in dfu mode so go ahead and place it in dfu mode have it hooked up to your computer and that ipsw file here here should be located on your desktop right about now so it's done just go ahead and click okay now since you're already in dfu mode here you don't have to do anything just go ahead and click on start and it's going to place your device in the pwned dfu mode it's going to run IB so that you can actually restore using the custom firmware that it creates so click okay there and we're done with snow breeze so you can just go ahead and just minimize it here iTunes May pop up if not open it select your device hold shift click restore and then go to the location where you had snow Breeze in my case my desktop select your custom firmware it should be prefixed with snow Breeze and then go ahead and click okay and then restore and now the restore will begin using the custom firmware and this will actually just go ahead and jailbreak your iPhone so this isn't like red snow it's a quite a bit different for Windows users who use snow Breeze when compared to um something like red snow this actually creates a custom firmware and then all you do is restore that firmware like you would a normal iPhone restore except this is obviously custom hence you have to put it into pwn dfu using the I tool located in snow breeze so this is going to take a little while as well um I'm going to speed this up as you can see it's sped up significantly you have a little snow icon there indicating that the custom firmware where is restoring all right so this little loading bar this takes a while probably took me about 10 or 15 minutes at the least so I've definitely sped this up for you guys so you're not waiting all day for me okay almost done there in the home stretch this end part really does take a while key doie almost there almost there just imagine how long you're going to have to wait this is sped up like crazy okay so we're our iPhone is finally rebooting now and one more little loading bar to sit through okay and you should see restoring iPhone firmware on your iTunes and you should see maybe a menu pop up like this it's restor board that's cool so now as your phone boots up you should see of course the setup menu and everything like that I'm going to go ahead and put in my my uh Wi-Fi username my SSID password and just get to the home screen so that's what you need to do right now just go ahead and set it up so you're at the home screen like this swipe over you should see Cydia now it's not going to load up because you actually have to perform a TT boot so place your device back into dfu mode one more one more time hold home and power for 10 seconds release the power button after 10 seconds continue holding home just in case you forgot how to use dfu mode after 10 additional seconds holding home just release and the screen should stay black just like this now what you want to do you should see the I booty file on your desktop load up I booty funny funny name all right and once that loads up it'll take about 10 seconds to load here once that loads up here you'll see select your device so just go ahead and pull this menu down select your iPhone or whatever device you're using click Start and then the tether jailbreak will begin now this isn't like a red snow tether jailbreak you won't see any pineapple logo or anything like that it'll just you'll just see the normal Little Apple logo like this and we'll give it a few more seconds and then we should be back to our lock screen and about five 4 3 2 1 there we go so we're at our lock screen now let's go ahead and unlock there's Cydia let's load it up and it's actually loading this time because of course this is a tether jailbreak so we needed to do that tether boot to get your Cydia working properly so we're good to go now our iPhone 4 is jailbroken using Windows and snow Breeze 29.7 this works with iOS 6.0 and iOS 6.0.1 so so let's go ahead and go to settings let me just prove to you guys that I am running iOS 6.0.1 General about and there you go 6.0.1 jailbroken using snow breeze 2.9.6 so let me know what you guys think in the comment section"

        "transcript": "[Music] so I had to change it up today as you can tell I got the change Stringer on I had to change it up because today wasn't actually arm day but we did back later but anyways what's going on guys Bradley Martin here and today I'm going to give you guys some tips something that has helped me improve I would say tenfold on my deadlift right but this isn't the deadlift it's the front squat so I'm here to tell you today why you guys should be doing the front squat and to kind of show you two different variations of the front squat um first off why you guys should be doing the front squat it besides increasing like your Cal size and the rear delts make your rear dels bigger getting your chest bigger um you know increasing how many girls you can get when you go out at the besides all those good things right it's really great at increasing anterior chain strength so the front of your body right it's great at making your core stronger so that when you're in the the the position for the deadlift you be in a stronger position it keeps your body more rigid keep your body more upright right so do not skip out on the front squats another thing it's great for something that I can personally attest to is quad development and quad strength and what I mean by that is I've always back squatted my whole life I've done before I got into Olympic W thing I I always squatted like in a power stance I squatted like a low bar and then I did High bar and still the involvement of my lower body was mostly my glutes and my hamstrings so those two muscle groups became most dominant for me so my butt got really big which is cool and girls like that do girls like that girls like that like yeah see okay so see what I'm saying girls like GL so that was good but I noticed for bodybuilding I was like okay I need to get my front right my quads stronger my quads not only stronger but look better so I switched it up I start to do front squats more often than I did back squats and I only did my quad start to develop faster um size definition but also my strength in the deadlift uhu my strength in overhead pressing stuff because my core is getting stronger my body was able to stay up more upright more rigid and all the other movements so do not skip out on front squats I know it's hard for a lot of people because you guys see me in the video and I'm I'm doing this front rack you guys are like wow his hands his wrist must be broken I've been doing it for a while I'm I'm used to that position but for you guys who are not um you can see my buddy Nathaniel right over here he was in the video as well doing the front squats just as much weight half the time that I was doing and no no not but this guy look he weighs like one how weigh 170 yeah he weigh light like I weigh is like 1,000 lb so anyways point is there's two different ways to do it so what's going to be best for probably most of you guys because of flexibility is the front rack how he did it where he's he's thinking about pushing the weight into his upper chest into the top of his clavicle and keeping his elbow up so you guys try it out that way see if you can get used to it um if you want to develop the flexibility in the wrist and the shoulders there's more exercises that go along with that I have some older videos on my channel that that highlight that stuff shoulder dislocations and stuff like that but anyways I hope this video helped you guys out point of this besides getting bigger calvs and giving you bigger shoulders and um getting you more girls it is making you stronger all around as an athlete as an individual so let's Get Better Together see you guys soon I hope you enjoyed the video give it a big thumbs up if you didn't blame that guy um and if you did blame this guy so see you guys soon I appreciate you uh what else what else do we have to add today yeah the de's back the de's back he's back he's back I'm out of here see you guys"

        "transcript": "greetings [\u00a0__\u00a0] today i have some [\u00a0__\u00a0] that i want to talk about um this is from a fan and uh my table is still wobbly i haven't bought tripods yet i apologize and if you see some discoloration in my eyeballs it's because i'm very tired i do not have a lot of energy and i don't know how i'm staying awake right now but anyways let's get to the point some updates have came out on runescape a new slayer monster uh i don't know i [\u00a0__\u00a0] pronounce that's why well i can't remember it offhand so i wrote down you know basically uh the name of it it's uh ice um try key worm well you know this is the first problem i have with this update and this you know slayer monster is one first of all the slayer monster hard name is very hard to say you come off a new slayer monster and you can't even pronounce the [\u00a0__\u00a0] name now if you can pronounce the name very well but me personally i can't pronounce half the names of [\u00a0__\u00a0] in room state and runescape perfect [\u00a0__\u00a0] example the game name itself arduin ardawan you know the town artawani arduini weenie weenie town weenie town pp town you know it's [\u00a0__\u00a0] up [\u00a0__\u00a0] like that anyways you gave the main point this new monster a friend of mine has 96 layer i believe he messaged me when this thingy came out he's like dude the monster dropped so much good [\u00a0__\u00a0] i'm getting so much good loot although i forgot the amount of loot that he got because while he was pming me i was kind of busy with my other hand at the moment so sorry luke if you're watching this video but i'm pretty sure that he said he got around like 400k or some [\u00a0__\u00a0] like that just off a couple kills so one of the positive things about this monster is that the you know it drops decent amount of [\u00a0__\u00a0] and you can get good loot and you know stuff like that and if you're sleepy and you're tired like me you really don't give a [\u00a0__\u00a0] so much slayer level 63 oh what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] am i saying 93 if it was 63 hey i'm level 63 now i'd be well actually i don't train combat so i wouldn't be over there something else that i want to talk about really quick is uh i stopped at the p.o box today i had to carry the mail from all you [\u00a0__\u00a0] in a garbage bag now not a garbage bag to throw out but a garbage bag to carry back to my car because i could not carry it with both my hands now my hands are you know somewhat large medium-sized i don't really know how you judge the size of hands but even if i were to carry it like in a bear hug type you know letters just you know so yeah i got a lot more letters you guys like my other video that i just made even though it was just a couple letters of me you know reading [\u00a0__\u00a0] off um and hey that video paid off i got a [\u00a0__\u00a0] party hat although i did get a [\u00a0__\u00a0] care bear even though i have been informed now by a lot of people is called a mud pip or a mud kip or a mud [\u00a0__\u00a0] i don't really know what you call it mudkins or something like that if the [\u00a0__\u00a0] is holding kfc is hostage is considered to be a goddamn care bear because care bears are [\u00a0__\u00a0] up care bears need to die the last thing i want to basically talk about is holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] something is vibrating in my house i think i have a [\u00a0__\u00a0] ghost in my house as we were saying the last thing that i wanted to talk about was basically machinima competition uh i don't really think i'll be making a video reason being is because my video is gonna be disqualified uh one is because my sense of humor as you guys all know is not in the terms of runescape which means runescape has its own set of rules basically as communist bastards as i'd like to refer to them is basically they have their own set of rules they have their own toss um terms of service all right and basically you gotta follow and their competition is following their toss so basically if if i say the word [\u00a0__\u00a0] or if you refer to any like for example i saw a really funny machinima competition video and it was basically on prostitution that video even though the person you know that make it the creator of the video said it hasn't been disqualified yet it most likely will and this will this person didn't even curse in the video and last year's competition i made a hubba hubba hubba dance video it was just me [\u00a0__\u00a0] around and stuff like that it got a decent amount of views like 50k views but the point of matter was it was disqualified because i used the word [\u00a0__\u00a0] it even though i only used the word [\u00a0__\u00a0] at once so the competition follows by their terms of service um so basically my humor could not be in the video because i have a very wide variety of humor i find many [\u00a0__\u00a0] to be very funny i find somebody sending me a letter that says [\u00a0__\u00a0] you in it very funny all right so they apparently don't because they have their own toss which is communism basically in my eyes and then there's youtube terms of service well youtube's toss and in youtube's toss you can basis freedom of speech if you want to see where [\u00a0__\u00a0] you and say the word [\u00a0__\u00a0] you're not being censored unlike on runescape which brings me to another thing and another topic for another day of the filter on runestate that escape i can't even [\u00a0__\u00a0] pronounce the guy named name see on runescape i will talk about that another day i am tired right now i am probably going to eat turkey because turkey puts you asleep so i will probably be going to sleep and holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] oh you son of a [\u00a0__\u00a0] god damn [\u00a0__\u00a0] moths you know it's not bad enough that i think i have a ghost among me but when there's holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] aren't ghosts i mean aren't moths attracted to light which ghosts equal light so there are many moths well there's only one actually but that means there are ghosts i must get this ghost in my house anyways even asked your little comments or dirty little comments dirty little comments if you have any uh another thing perverted questions you guys asked me uh i haven't even begun to read through them i'm sorry i just been really busy so i gotta start doing that oh my neck is cramping i think a ghost just bitch-lapped me uh yeah see you guys later bye"

        "transcript": "hey sports fans coach Nick here and welcome to bball breakdown don't miss Ben dowsett's excellent article on Alec Burke's extension and Kevin Fan's terrific analysis of Po Gasol's game with the bulls let's break right into Rudy Gay's Monster game for the Sacramento Kings last night the Kings added some pieces to the roster and their offense has taken a turn for the better this year with Spurs and triangle influence let's break down most of Rudy's field goals and take a look how he got to 40 points the kings run Hawk with a screen and roll on the left side and a double pin down for mmore on the right the weak side action gives Rudy space to get the pop pass and hit an easy two a simple Sprint to the rim forces a mismatch and while cousins looks confused that someone besides him is posting up he gets it down low and with Rudy Gay's huge size Advantage he keeps it very simple with a drop step and high release on the short jumper Portland tries to ice this pick and roll by forcing gay away from the screen a nice adjustment by Boogie to Pivot and change the direction of the pick spacing isn't ideal as it leads Rudy into a spot where two of his teammates are spotting up allowing their men to be easily in the way however he wisely doesn't force it and gets a sliver of daylight on the step back the kings run a bit of a triangle sit with a pass at the corner which triggers the passer cutting through and the center screening for the ball again Portland forces him to the Baseline so he simply takes what the defense gives him and an effective shot fake gives him a good look here's an interesting alignment that basically looks like pinch post but it gets old school when gay goes to the post for the elbow feed like this we used to see this type of post entry a lot in the 70s and I really like the screen and roll from this position and Rudy gets uh creative with his footwork on the push jump hook the key to this play is that Rudy was willing to pass the ball up the court this often leads to good things for the passer as the defense has to scramble the catch up on Q Portland gets stuck in a mismatch and gay hits his first three on an ISO versus Robin Lopez here's an example of a break where there wasn't an opening to pass ahead but by pushing it he again forces a mismatch with the short West Matthews this is where the Kings have changed instead of forcing up a tough shot the ball gets fired around the perimeter everyone is a willing passer and Carson threads a great pass to Rudy who gets the bucket on a tough Big Boy finish the kings run the Spurs motion week with cison going lower than usual before popping out to the wing this triggers Flex action down low the spacing isn't great you don't really want to set these screens in the lane for spe 3 seconds as well as making it easier on the defense to cover but they do execute it well enough and Rudy reads it well curling and finishing with great footwork on the up and under same motion week set up on this set but instead of flex they run a sideline screen and roll West gets caught helping one pass away and that forces Batum to rotate one pass away which leaves Rudy all alone for the easy Corner three great ball movement again out of bounds play should always be run to get a score quickly and the kings run some nice action for gay after he inbounds it he has the choice of using Boogie's Baseline screen or Landry's pin down Batum guesses badly and Aldridge is too late getting a hand up and down the stretch when the Kings really needed a bucket they have Rudy bring the ball up and go right into a pick and roll with cousins while Portland contains it well gay is simply on fire and there's not much Batum could do as the Kings maintain control and got a huge home victory"

        "transcript": "[Music] what's up guys this is nexi I played Little Big Planet when it first came out in 2008 and now with the sequel coming out next week I wanted to check out what kind of content the gamees community has built over the last 2 years for those of you who aren't familiar with the game little big planet is a platformer that allows people to create their own crazy levels you end up with some pretty awesome creations so here's the first pick of my top five favorite levels spider SackMan by X nobody X all right now we're watching some spider sack man it's a level and the reason I chose is because he use the simplest objects and the simplest mechanics but it still creates an excellent level and a lot of my buddies tell me like I didn't buy a little big planet because it's for kids or whatever it's not for kids guys it can be hard and I don't know how I fell there but it's not going to happen again so I have a few lives uh if I run out of lives I have to start all over again but there's checkpoints and there's bubbles you see me picking up the bubbles and that's to improve my score you see it up on the top left and here we go I'm Spider-Man swinging over the buildings in Manhattan might be a childhood fantasy of mine maybe that's why I love this level so much but uh I'm trying to get to the end and after you're done you can see the leaderboard and see how you rank up against everybody else and the more bubbles you collect the better your score will be that looks like the Chrysler Building right there you thought I was going to fall didn't you yeah I'm the best I'm supposed to go down here all right let me yon my way to the top collecting a few more bubbles now this is the hard part I got to get over this antenna haven't really figured it out all right I think I got to get momentum not enough momentum and and you kind of get frustrated like you'll sit there trying to solve one little mini puzzle but that's I guess what it's all about all right why isn't this moving me drop down why not there we go flipping levers all right I'm just going to grab this I know this part I don't want to hit the electricity I don't want to hit the fire that was close there's another one that's not moving I'm guessing I have to flip a lever all right there we go oh this one's moving fast whoa yeah all right here we go I guess that's a spider web oh picture taken yeah think I got bonus points for that I think this is a little past the halfway mark there's another checkpoint for you oh I suck at this part coming up I'm going to do a first try for you guys though let's go get some momentum up and over dude I'm trying to play Can You shiby is in front of the TV right now no oh my God get out of my way all right here we go I'm going to nail it this time bet you $20 I get over three two jump land on it I was just kidding about the $20 all right if I don't get it here I'm just going to quit out so you better hope I get it cuz I really want to show you the end money in the bank flying over the building one final final try serious serious mode here we go all right right I'm in the zone baby MLG finals yeah landed on the web brilliant let's go all right please try I'm reading and I can't even play here we go all right let me jump on the spider web there was a checkpoint please try my other levels yes X nobody X I will try your other levels guys this was spider sack man definitely check it out one of the more simple levels but it sure is fun that was the end right there I'm going to got I got 2,24 points 2,24 points beat that and the leaderboard will come up here and show me how I did but yeah that was uh number five out of the five"

        "transcript": "hey rer you all right hello YouTube dawsome Rider here with another uh figurearts no this isn't figurearts sorry um this is a Ben 10 Ultimate Alien review of the dis alien Omnitrix essentially the definitive version for this year which we'll be using for all the toy gimmicks uh let's get started with the packaging um so you know at the top here we got the Ultimate Alien Logo with Ben doing his action pose um and then the UL Matrix is right here uh voices and lights it says and it says it in different languages um then it shows ultimate humongousaur disc so it comes with that so if you don't want to get the figures you really don't need Tim humongousaur um then it shows how it works stick the disc in it lights up and then you're all pop and then you're all happy face okay dis Alien Ultimatrix other languages nothing on the side on the back uh shows how it works once again with another picture of it the disc it comes with and then it advertises the alien collection uh you you know what disc they come with uh they reissued him and him I don't know whether I'm going to get them again actually I don't know if I have him anyway I'm not going to know if I'm going to get anybody again just for a disc I might just try to trick it out so that I get the sounds so let's go ahead and get this guy open and see how it works okay so we've got the Ultimatrix out of package let's take a look at how it looks um it looks okay I mean the outside green color is all nicely done there's you know the tubes here and the black it's fine this a little panel here which you apparently use for taking it off um all fine paint the Omnitrix symbol in here looks okay it's kind of got this grid um it looks weird because of you know the the little buttons here to activate the noises so that makes it look weird it does have a nice cloth green strap which is really nice um as compared to like you know the plastic ones of the past so that's really cool they have that so is this on no it's not on so to turn it on push on make that activation noise so standardly when you push it up it'll make this noise and then and then that noise when you push it in so it comes with the ultimate humongousaur disc here um now I was practicing with this and it doesn't seem to want to say its name but let's try it anyway it may may say water hazard so we're going to slide the disc in you slide it in like this and wait for to make confirmation there we go then it'll make that standing by noise and then push this up water haed no sir that is not water Hazard um I cannot get it to do it like I don't know what's wrong I don't that's for Nintendo cartridges that doesn't work I let's try that again let's try [Applause] it no you okay let's come back to that all right so this is the disc that comes with it it's supposed to say ultimate humongousaur so I got all the discs that I have with this stuff so far with the exception of armadillo and ultimate humongousaur so let us start from what I have on the top which is nanom so let's put it in in slide it in no you oh God help okay slide it [Applause] inan sanom Mech and its cute voice uh sounds quite nice and clear um here we have the actual water hazard no okay there we [Applause] go what see he says what he's supposed to say cuz he's actually water hazard so um now we have ultimate Big Chill so we're just going to slide it in standby the button up ultimate Big Chill ultimate Big Chill so push it in pull it out now we've got ultimate smot fire standby noise timate swap fire cool take it out um here's wrath this is going to be a really surprise when I was ready so we got it in standby generic transformation noise I've tried this six ways from Sunday there's no noise for wrath sad face wrath is one of my favorite aliens from Ultimate Alien and then here's load star this guy got stuck in here earlier another generic noise so load star and wrath apparently have no sound if you know otherwise please correct me but as of right now I'm believing they have no sound um let's try the one that comes with the again alaur let's put it in the right way and not be tards wait which is the right way okay I'm a tired so let's try it this is going to be ridiculous if I can't get this in its own review this is ridiculous water haard okay so it's not working let me see if I can get it to work off camera and come back okay so I fiddled with it and by pressing this button and this button simultaneously when it's pushed down you'll get ultimate so at least you able to hear [Applause] itate hum there we go so um I could go around and be you know whatever and uh push all the buttons and get the other voices but then you wouldn't have any other reason to watch my other alien reviews so we're going to wait on that but for messing around with it it appears that it only has sounds for the ultimate aliens and uh the new ones introduced uh in Ultimate Alien nothing for load star and wrath which is which is really sad so bottom line um I'm pretty disappointed with this um I'm disappointed in the fact that it looks kind of funky you know with the the buttons and whatnot and I'm disappointed with the whole disc thing cuz it doesn't really work as cool as I thought you know you put it in and it pops up which is kind of like the show but not really and then it also doesn't give you that feel like the view scope is you know when you push it down like your hero uh it's it just doesn't have that feel to it the way the mechanism Works uh the discs can get stuck in here really easily um and no sounds for load star and wrath and uh the fact that only has sounds it's nice to have the sounds for the ultimate aliens but technically he can never use the Holograms for the Ultimate Alien so it's just kind of a disappointment all around um you know I'm not tooo sure what to make of this uh what was the other complaint I had oh yeah um the sounds are clear which is really nice and the strap is nice so that's what I have to say so U overall if you're into the sounds and you're going to collect the alien collection anyway uh it's not a bad buy it's fun for the sounds I'm glad I have it to do the sounds for the review use and just in general but um if you're just wanting you know a playable one I actually recommend the view scope over this makes you feel more like hero time uh once I review the uh Omnitrix uh what is it hold on I have it right here legacy Omnitrix you'll know which one is the definitive one to buy but in the meantime I say just might pass on this one save yourself 20 bucks it's a it's not the best I think they could have uh come up with a lot better gimmick for this so that's about all you can check out the podcast at writers Rangers ramble. and please help us with the donations and all that good stuff so that's about it so take care it's Dawson writer signing out"
