blathered here on my bed and I'm just gonna pick and go and show you guys what I got the first place that I want to was walgreens initially i went into walgreens why did I go into walgreens in the

color at gmas Merle emerald whatever you say it maybelline i also got the instant age rewind eraser dark to go whatever this concealer you know I've been seeing and hearing a lot about this concealer and help people raving about it so I wanted to like give it a shot see I'm really late on the bandwagon with these new products because I feel like they're constantly coming out with some kind of new products and I can't keep up and my wallet can keep up either so i tried what i can and i like to use up my products before i start buying more stuff so I started trying this one and I really really really really love it I got it in the color brightener illuminator and then I went back the next day and I got another one because i really love it and i got the one in the color light and then also wanted and I got my first color was first I got this color right here it's a nice coral color it's called coral ambition and I also got the pink one but it's in my purse and I don't know where my purse is right now so I yeah so then after all greens came CBS oh lordy Lordy why did they have to put Walgreens and CVS right next to each other when they're both dangerous like Hello initially I went in and I got some face wash aveeno face washes these were like five dollars each they were like on sale so i bought the aveeno positively radiant brightening cleanser i love this face wash like i

absorbing sheets I got to the CVS brand oil absorbing sheets right here honestly like CBS well I clean and clear they're all the same they do the exact same thing so I just have to save myself to

        "transcript": "hey y'all so i'm here today to do a quick tutorial on how to apply false lashes for beginners i struggled with this for such a long time and the other day i was in such a rush but i wanted to wear lashes so bad so i just kind of came up with it off the top of my head i always struggled with lashes because i would put the lash glue on the eyelash strip and then i would try to apply it to my lash line but the glue would always end up getting on my eyelid or something like that i made up a cool little trick and i'm going to share that with you guys today so if you want to see how i applied these lashes then just keep on watching so i want to apologize in advance to you guys my camera does not have autofocus but i will leave all the information on the products i used in the description box below so i went ahead and did one lash off camera and now i'm going to go ahead and do the other one for you so you're going to want to grab your bobby pin and add a little bit of glue to the end now one thing i forgot to mention is that you can start with black eyeliner if you want but i forgot so you're just going to spread the glue along your lash line and you just want to continue doing that until the full lash line is covered in glue so now you're going to grab your lash and a pair of tweezers and you're going to clip the middle of the lash on the lash hair not the last strip and then you're just going to place it on the middle of your natural lash line now you can go ahead and place the end of the lash towards the outer corner of your eyelashes and do the same thing for the inner corner now that you have the lash placed the way you prefer you can go ahead and take your index finger and your thumb and squeeze together the false lash into your real lash so that it blends naturally and you're all done so i hope this tutorial was helpful if you have any other questions feel free to leave me a comment or send me a message you"

        "transcript": "right if you're concerned about your cholesterol levels you know there are a lot of foods that you should avoid and keeping high cholesterol foods off your plate certainly one thing but what food should we eat to lower our levels to answer that question we brought a nutritionist mega Rourke I'm nutritionally sound so great to have you here thank you very much so what cholesterol level should we be striving okay the cholesterol level you want to strive for is about 180 but you have to keep in mind there's the good cholesterol which is the HDL and then there's the bad cholesterol which is the LDL the really important thing is to get the ratio from your doctor don't just get the total cholesterol because that does not tell you what your risk is you don't know your risk until we divide the total cholesterol by the HDL level which would be less than 5 + 3.5 is really good so in other words if you had a cholesterol level of 180 but your HDL was only 30 that would mean you're level your ratio was 6 and that is not good so you need to get the total level you could have a level that's 200 but you have HD L that's 60 then that's good okay all right so what what uh can we be eating to significantly lower our cholesterol okay so studies show that if you lose say even 10 pounds you can decrease your LDL level by eight percent so the foods that you want to stick with our foods that are going to go through your system quickly like the soluble fibers here oatmeal lentils lots of vegetables sweet potatoes those are the things that are going to go through your help absorb the cholesterol and push it through your system fiber can help us lower fiber can greatly help you lower the cholesterol level you want to get 25 to 35 grams of fiber a day according to the American Heart Association excellent what else do we have here we also have things that are lower in cholesterol HDL level go up they say one glass of wine a day it will actually increase your HDL level you want to stay away from the things that are saturated fats or trans fats and if you don't eat a lot of fish you want to buy things that are already there adding omega-3 to the eggs now they have some spreads that have the omega fatty acids in you know salmon olives avocado nuts olive oils canola oil those are the things that you want to look for excellent what are plant sterols I've heard of these before plant sterols are things that are going to help you absorb the cholesterol and push it through your system once again so that will be in nuts avocados those kind of things that we just discussed over here walnuts excellent meg so let's pleasure having you here thank you and hey listen if you want more information on eating right you can always go to our website it's Fox Providence com thanks Sean silicon"

        "transcript": "hey guys okay see ya today's big here is going to be about my travel blender so when I'm here at home part of my day-to-day routine is having a sleep breakfast and it's something that I want to continue doing while I am traveling and it's different if you're only on a short holiday somewhere but when you're going for 12 months you want to try and still maintain a good routine liner away otherwise I'll get back and the 20 kilos of you so I started researching small kind of travel blenders because I still learned to be able to take my smoothies on the go but I also had to be aware that I needed to put it in the suitcase it had to be light and I really was something that was really easy and quick to use so I have a kind of feel my kind of favorite food blogs and some of the people that I follow recommended the tribest personal blender so those what I ended up getting I got it off the website raw pleasure comm delay you there's a few different versions of the tribest personal blender that you can get and they all come with the same base and it really just uses in the attachments that you get so I got the PB 250 which is kind of middle of the range and it comes with two of the large blending cups two of the small grinding cups comes with three standard lips and these are fantastic because sometimes you make a smoothie and maybe you don't want to have it then you might have a little bit later they just screw on and then you can pop them in the fridge and it also comes with this awesome little sippy cup travel attachment as well so if I generally make one in the morning and on the walk to work I drink it like that the PB 250 model as well comes with two of the blender attachments so this is your standard blender attachment and this comes with all of the models so this is your base attachment this does your normal kind of smoothies and blending crushes ice so that other attachment is called the grinding attachment I think and grind coffee beans with it you can grind spices with it but the thing that I use it for is actually for grinding flax seeds so flax seeds that's it's fantastic for you they're really high in omega-3 so if you don't need a lot of fish it's amazing to eat flax seeds they're also called Ian seeds as well and the thing with flax seeds is that you actually can't digest them whole so they're quite big little seeds so if you sprinkle that on cereal or if you just kind of eat some they actually don't digest when they're like this you can also already buy flax seeds pre-ground what happens is they actually oxidize very quickly after you grind them so the stuff that you buy that's already ground has probably most of most of its nutrients so it is you can actually grind up your flax seeds to a powder and include that in your daily smoothie so I'm just going to give you a little demonstration and make up a smoothie for myself now I already had my morning smoothie which consists of water frozen mango kale chia seeds hemp protein powder and spirulina that's what I have every morning I've already had that so I don't want to make another one so I'm going to make a chocolate banana smoothie because chocolate okay so we started by just sticking some water in here and it's very good it's got a measurement gauge on the side here so you can see how much worried want to put in there I usually just gets me and then I'm going to stick in now I only have a tiny bit of kale left for the 8:00 news this morning three seconds so I'm just gonna tear the kale off the stem because this isn't one of those amazing Vitamix or Blendtec blenders ones that you can blend iPhones with I wouldn't stick the whole stem in there because it'll probably be a little bit chewy at the end or it's gonna still not be blended down so I would just pull it off because I don't have much kale I'm gonna actually sit these cost lettuce now let us seems like a really odd thing to stick in a smoothie but course lettuce actually has a whole heap of great nutrients in it I don't remember my hand and you know what I've forgotten to do first it's actually glad the flaxseed so instead we're gonna find them in the smaller cup you can actually grind them in the big cup first and then I want to round up stick the rusty stuff in I am an idiot seeds in here and then all we do here is we put that on a stick at the machine here and push down so had I done this I could have just stuck everything on top but I didn't so I'm gonna stick the flax seeds in with the rest of the stuff there and a few little extra bits I want to put it in about putting the extra bits in this is some maca powder because I want to make this a chocolate I'm going to use some cacao powder and just raw cacao powder and it's absolutely amazing for you again it's got all sorts of good properties that I don't remember that's my friends it's my smoothies we had the water or the banana kale we had the cost lettuce we have the ground-up flax seeds which we ground up using a little grinding place we've got some backup and we've got the count now if you don't have frozen fruit in here I will generally then stick three ice cubes in there because then when it dries it all up it's going to be nuts of coal and you'll be able to drink it straight away instead of having to put in their fridge this is really great it's got two little ways of using it so you can just push down you push and turn and it means you don't have to hold it down sorry I just had a smoothie I'm gonna put this innovation and that is my try this professional blender which is small app so you can see the base to here and this one one of these cups here so what I'll do is let me just take one cup with me Charlie and the base this will easily fit in my suitcase and now I have to worry about taking a huge blender but I also get to stay healthy so thanks guys for watching if you have any comments or questions about the tribes' personal blender please just ask in the comments below and I will answer them for you okay thanks guys Dishman I hope you and I wanna continue my judgment she's gonna go home only to go"

take the footage from the good old theater mode afterwards I don't have to record while I'm gaming but yeah live Comforts and Modern Warfare 3 decided to uh jump on uh yeah some M dub three I haven't played this game in Forever uh so we'll see how this actually how this actually plays out but I've ran into so so so so so so many hackers uh these last couple of last couple of games and it's been no so much fun oh God I gotta remember to pick up the tags you have the uh you know you have the incentive to pick up the tags in Black Ops 2 because you get the score yeah the scoring games you get your score streaks Etc but in this game not so much hello not so much and more bang no God damn it but in this game no you get nothing and I feel I feel like I don't really want to pick up the tags man I mean there's no real reason for me to pick up the tags oh God that was so close I would probably do horrible I haven't played this game in forever man so much [\u00a0__\u00a0] in this game just put just by playing a few games just trying to warm up before I did my live calm Jesus there is a whole lot of [\u00a0__\u00a0] in this game thank you God Almighty UAV oh God it's so close um yeah so much [\u00a0__\u00a0] in this game it's [\u00a0__\u00a0] the demos had all the Death streaks it's so good that they don't have death streaks in in Black Ops 2 hello host leave oh God I have to sync it up again uh okay well let's see here five four three two one start uh why are you spawning right in front of me what what thank you Almighty spawn what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] thank you game that was a nice bond for me God these guys are so low left this guy's level one this is a Christmas noob in Modern Warfare 3 why did he get this game it's old this game old though this game old we got a Christmas noob in modern warfare three oh they're over here they're over here hello you sit down oh a friend died over here yeah but it's so soothing to play um somebody middle to play Black Ops 2 because they don't have that streets and stuff like that but I don't know I kind of miss especially it's not gonna lie guys I enjoy Specialists I I like what it makes me feel like it makes me feel like a superhero like I can do anything and I mean that's pretty much it I mean and that's why I like it and I think it's a lot more enjoyable to watch gameplays too and I mean that's obviously hello Moab that's very subjective obviously because I mean you might not share my opinions and thoughts but I feel like when I'm watching a gameplay if you watch I mean like a lodestar in Black Ops 2 when the load star gets when the load star gets you know that's actually trying to go for a double this game we could probably do that um when you go for a um I was gonna say something what the hell was I gonna say hold on when you go for um yeah no when you get a load sign the loads are just absolutely rapes the enemy team I mean you get probably per load star I mean it's not impossible to get 20 upwards of 20 kills and that's kind of like watching somebody use like a like a [\u00a0__\u00a0] machine or a [\u00a0__\u00a0] robot against I mean opponents with only guns I mean it doesn't really seem fair and it's I don't know when I'm watching a gameplay I want to see somebody like really tear up the enemy team and of course you can do that with killer streaks and it's fun and whatnot but I would much rather prefer somebody doing like a gun only thing and I mean you don't really see that in in Black Ops 2 because you have the streaks but in Modern Warfare 3 a lot or more a lot more people were you know subject to using uh using the Specialists over over the street sorry I can't talk god damn it when I'm focusing trying to get this trying to get this double double Moab this is this is quite interesting that I can do this well after being being away for so long I mean I haven't been away from like gaming but still I've been you know I've been hello I've been uh been playing other games sure they've been Call of Duty but oh God hit markers are they still there oh hello oh nice double yeah it's been Call of Duty but it's oh they're right down here it's been Call of Duty but hasn't necessarily been the mw3s I've been playing aeon I enjoy aeon like a mother I can still go back and just run just lobbies of aeon over and over again I enjoy that game so much so much fun I wish they had a on in God oh God I'm gonna bail it's Christ I wish they had Aeon in mother Warfare 3 or in uh not in other words for three okay tell I'm [\u00a0__\u00a0] nervous right now I'm stressed but they don't have Aeon in the Black Ops 2. they do have six as those I enjoy that but ah enjoy uh I enjoy aeon way with way more there we go that's a double oh double Deuce before the game ends so there we go guys hopefully you have enjoyed me trying to talk about score streaks and whatnot it's been it's been interesting uh it's always like you know guys and multitasking especially me like trying trying to try hard and talk at the same time and kind of kind of get confused sometimes but yeah guys hope you have enjoyed rate the video after please add it to your favorites if you really enjoyed it and if you want to see more live comes let me know man I'm always down to talk about nothingness and just rape noobs so uh yeah guys let me know in the comment section Below have an incredible day and I

        "transcript": "hey guys it's FIFA rally here and welcome to episode 84 of let's FIFA 13 and as you can see I picked a bunch of attribute cards giving a player plus six attack and I actually also went out and bought a lot of head coaches meaning that this card will give a plus n attack to any player I apply it on and as you can see here they do only cost around 200 coins so very cheap and uh I've never used them before in Ultimate Team only if I got them in a pack and then quickly film them on a player but never on a game to game basis and what I want to test is if it actually does work well on a player and the fault behind this is basically instead of going out and picking up a very expensive inform you can maybe use 20K over 100 games to have one player that is just a stand out player and I mean it's probably not the best idea if you're going for a cheap inform but let's say I want to play a 352 and have two Strikers with Five Star skills I do only see a few Strikers that are able to to use on the striker position and that is Ibrahimovic wallison maybe fed Faus Terra and uh inform Neymar could work as well but they would none of them would link up apart from wallison and inform Neymar and going out and picking up in neyar is very expensive and you'll probably make a loss once you sell him because of the tax so instead of getting that loss on the tax and which might be 50k something like that you can use 20K to play a strion 100 and 100 games and I doubt you will use an in name for 100 games so the idea is to test this out and see if it works and if it doesn't all right but but if it works it might be a pretty cool idea to open up a lot of spots when spots in your squad when you're you're building a squad because sometimes you have that weak player which you think he will not fit into the squad but if you use this technique you might be able to use him so uh the squad I'm building is some cheap players all around apart from in Rino and wallison of course matu there on the defensive mids only 14k quite cheap and some good all round stats and then we have um a pretty solid defense with quite a bit of pace then Ben ala and Ayah with the five star skills on right mid left mid and the final player as the striker is elgon which I'll will try the technique out on so as you can see he does have some all around good stats but I always feel he's whenever he's up against those uh you know your typical center backs with kabo David L stuff like that he's just not quick enough to get past him or strong enough so the the thing I think is if you apply the card you'll have some all around good stats which which you'll see here in just a second uh I will apply it and I believe he got gets around yeah 83 Pace very good shooting dribing heading all his stats are in the 70s already which is all right for 75 rated card but if we apply um apply the fitness card with the coaches he will actually end up being like a 84 rated player and his stats looks pretty tasty 83 Pace 84 shooting 83 passing 87 dribbling and 85 heading that is some all around really good stats and uh I'll play maybe 10 to 20 games with this squad and try out this technique and if it works out I'll probably use it from time to time in other squads if there's a single player I do not feel fits in perfectly so going into the first game I go into the quarterfinals of the goal cup and I come up against a very nice 352 side there with some good players a three five star skillers as well and I make a major mistake to start off with I take a long touch with my keba I I meant to boot it away straight away but it ends up being a touch and delayed boot away I guess we could call it and he picks it up to make it one n and 2 N and 3-0 it is in the 83rd minute so I thought was I wrong making this decision making this team and trying out this technique or was it just playing a terrible game I do manag to get it back but really A 3-1 loss it wasn't what I had expected so I wanted to play one more game with them see if I can make up for it see if I can get a good goal maybe so we go into the round of 16 teams continuing with the side trying out the technique and I come up against a a pretty nice team here as you can see here 352 Ser a side which tend to be very difficult to break down at least for me but I will get the game started in the first minute nice stuff here from wallison making his way into the box and then a lot of clumsy stuff happening and somehow the ball will fall to elgon who puts it into the back of the net to make it one nil so not the best of goals but keepon CR Chan here with elerson making his way into the box takes a shot but it does hit the bar H and then it's Ronaldinho's turn to get a shot in and we get the B Ki here with wallison but it is of s side so we go into the uh to the second half where he will man has to push back in the 51st minute with moli but just 5 minutes later it is Ben ala on the ball doing some nice stuff out of the wing cutting in behind the defender and we'll pass it all the way across and I tried to pass to uh Gustavo there but it do not happen it ends up being aah picking the ball up to make it 2-1 and one final goal we'll get a r Ronaldinho there to make it 3-1 and that is how the game will end so I'm through it to the quarterfinals and I do manage to pick up a win with the side uh but I had to change team the fitness were running pretty low so I go with the 43 two1 side for the quarterfinals and I mentioned this in the last episode this team is starting to work out really well for me placing to wrapped at the striker position and then swapping or putting Miki on the center mid means basically you'll always have four players up in front you will have D rosi defending on the in the Midfield and then you will have um David being the Box tobox player running back and forth which tends to work pretty well for me and there I get my first chance here in the fourth minute but the keeper will save it and then diasi in in the 40th minut trying out a long shot and it goes out for a corner and straight from the corner will actually manage to pick the ball up here pass it out to Rino and it's a long time since since I scored a goal like this a finesse shot into the top Corner reminding me a little bit of FIFA 12 there and then we get a very nice goal here a nice link up play between lamea and R to make it 2N and that is how the game will end and we through to the semi finals which will be the last game of this episode doing a bit of Club maintenance a lot of my players all of the sudden want to contracts five of them uh doing the club maintenance and then we go into the game and I come up against another pretty nice Premier League team which you'll see here in just a second some all one good players but two offensive mids on the center mid might not prove for the best choice on the counter attacks uh but I will get the game started here with a nice shot in front to ra and that was pretty much all that happened in that game skill-wise so I win the game one0 through to the final and it will be the end of the episode guys I hope you enjoyed it and I will most likely have another one out tomorrow so thank you for watching and I will talk to you later [Music]"

        "transcript": "[Music] what is up everybody white lighting HJ here with another video and today we're going be doing a farming video farming to Max town hall 10 now we're going to start this off with a wh of a raid and it's going to be an all Archer attack that'll Bas that'll basically be the uh the majority of the attacks you will see for this series mainly because that's what I farm with so all archers if you guys want to see some interesting attacks uh you guys can check out my uh learning go Wei uh series that I have a lot of awesome go attacks with like really really huge raids in it like loot wise so uh but with this raid as you can see one it's just stuff with loot two I just circled the base and archers it's just the same pretty much it's the same strategy every single raid uh and that really helps a lot with when there's like not a lot of strategy because it's not that like I'm an ass attacker and it's easy for me with no strategy because you you guys should know that I'm a decent attacker but when all you have to do is just make a circle around the base it just makes it a hell of a lot easier to to get all the loot and I don't know barch everybody keeps telling me you know barch is more efficient it's it's better I'm like I don't know dude I suck with barch for some reason I cannot barch for my life all archers that's that's a different story I'm pretty good with that so throw my king at the bottom use his ability just to get that extra Firepower from those barbarians and help him melt through those walls and uh put my clan castle in as well even though I'm not sure if that was really needed I threw it in anyways threw the Lightning Spell down on that gold and on The Elixir I have just been dropping them lightning spells like they're hot and uh King went down so I'd figured that I would let the clan castle troops just kind of play through oh and I did let them get that that 50% by the way giving me an extra 100K each oh wait I was in Masters 2 during this one uh that was more than 100K each but uh it was a hefty bonus gave me 350,000 gold 330,000 Elixir plus my bonus brought that up to uh over an 800,000 loot raid which was awesome so uh that was a really good raid a lot of money and I've been finding decent raids in Masters it's nothing special but kind of like in the Masters 2 Masters like the 2700s that's where I'm farming um I've been finding some pretty decent raids and I think that's where I'm going to stay and farm until I you know I just can't find anything else so uh with this base now this base was a little bit more tricky but fortunately I did have my queen and that was my phone let's silence that  right quick um so I dropped the two lightning spells on that mortar kind of in the middle uh just to kind of get rid of that threat because uh mortars are archers worst enemy same with wizard towers especially cuz they're just one hit kill and if you have a whole group of archers and their dumbass runs into a clump right next to a wizard tower or a mortar you're not going to have a good day let me tell you that much or Giant Bomb there's a good example like Giant Bomb suck ass too but um so with this base I kind of wanted to clear out the stuff especially that mortar on the left side and then uh I attacked full on from this right side with all of my 175 archers and my king queen and clan castle will come in a little bit later so I waited for those two archers to take out the rest of that gold storage or a gold collector and then uh I just basically unloaded on this base with my uh with my king and queen and my archers and luckily I did have my heroes during this raid if I didn't have my heroes I would not have gotten like nearly as far as I did uh I and I probably should have putting the archers in two big clumps rather than kind of like spread them out like that cuz I don't know a lot of them pointlessly died cuz they're trying to break like four walls right now but the king leads and uh fortunately the wizard tower locks on to the king so I do not have to worry about that wizard tower taking out my archers but on the right side that to is going to be quite the  and kill like 90% of my archers on that side uh but that's all right cuz the queen still goes to work uh King already made his way through all of the loot on that left side and he's going to be uh basically just tanking for that for that group of archers and those archers are also going to do some work Queen is going to work on the right side is still have her special ability left and uh fortunately there were enough archers that you know the uh they took out that multitarget Inferno which was pretty awesome so then the clan castle minions come in and I do prefer clan castle minions when I'm farming just because archers can shoot over walls uh so or they can shoot over walls and shoot buildings that are outside of the walls so I like using I I don't know why I'm stuttering I like uh I always stutter what the I like using minions because they can get what the archers can't so I use the queen special ability and pretty much all the loot in the middle of the base is gone now luckily here watch the enemy Queen how it shoots that Archer right in front of my queen usually the my queen would have been pulled by that but she wasn't for some reason which was all right uh so pretty much all the loot was gone that I was going to get I could have dropped the Lightning Spell but I decided not not to and I saved the Queen's Health just by a little bit that raate got me what like 323,000 gold and 260,000 Elixir plus my bonus brought that rate up to like over 5 600k which was awesome so back to my base uh we do not have a lot of Elixir I've been having some problems Elixir Farming just because I haven't been able to play much lately and uh Elixir is a lot harder to get at Town Hall 10 than gold is um and especially since I'm trying to get all my Elixir upgrades uh I do want to max out all of my Army Camps before we do a push now I think there is a push in Dolphin Stars uh either in January or December those are the rumors that I hear I'm a co-leader I should know when we're pushing but I don't so the rumors that I'm hearing is that we are going to be pushing in December or January which means I need to get my upgraded uh before I start a serious push I want to have all my Barracks maxed out oh not Barracks I lied all my Army Camps I am not getting P.K sorry so sorry uh but I do want my Army Camps maxed and I want my goii Army maxed as well cuz I will be probably using that to push uh along with um along with uh Whatchamacallit uh wait hold on I just wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute recording's weird oh along with uh balloons and that was I'm sorry I apologize for that I had a I I am using two systems to record right now basically because iMovie is my computer's horrible and I can't really voice record with my movie because it's so bad but back on the topic uh I will be using balloons and minions to push up to 3600 and then after that I'll be using Gobi so I'm going to be upgrading my free spell to level two here I really need to upgrade it cuz the free spell is not that great at level one as you guys probably know if if any of you have tried to go we we with it um but I did upgrade that free spell and then I was kind of debating on what I wanted to upgrade with my gold because I only had 300,000 Elixir so I couldn't really do anything with that except for get that gem box and uh I had 7.5 million gold and four Builders so I'm like what should I get so I uh nervously collected all of my loot here because I figured that I would be broke as hell after I was done with this I didn't miss an El Elixir collector on the left side all you guys with uh with uh whatever the thing is called where you you need everything clicked I I can't even think of the thing right now whatever it we're going to be upgrading some Skelly traps all right that's what's happening right now that's real time uh not really this is recorded like a couple days ago but despite that uh so upgraded my Three Skeleton traps I didn't upgrade those initially cuz I figured that they would be gone after the Halloween update but they weren't and I was just stupid I guess um but yeah I did finally I get those to two I'll be upgrading those to three pretty soon here I think they're like 1.2 million uh to go to three so I was debating getting my Expo to level two I was like e that's a lot of gold and I was like ah it so uh in a second here I will upgrade the Expo to level two I'll try to get that sucker to level three as quick as I can then I need to start maxing out my Inferno Towers uh because level ones look kind of weak and I want my base looking badass especially I'm going to have a push coming up pretty soon here I definitely do want my base looking quite the badass one and I need some Max troop so yeah before the push I really want to get my queen to at least 30 well I don't know if that's going to happen but I'm going to try and uh I want to get my uh my go Wei we pushing Army maxed which which should happen uh decently quick so uh that's going to be it for the video If you guys enjoy this video make sure to like the video subscribe follow me on Twitter white liting hbd check out all the links in

        "transcript": "ponyfans.com here with cornerback Richard Crawford and uh you come over from Saddleback College in California compare for a minute the the differences between training camp here under June Jones and the training camps you went through at Saddleback well the ones at Saddleback are a lot um harder to be honest it's a lot longer um these These are more um crisp and efficient like we we were about to S back but it was a lot longer practice than we were hdden people during Camp to see who can tackle who couldn't tackle but here is just about flying around to the ball and working on your tackling technique to be a better tackler so I think it's a lot more efficient here than it was in my jco what about the learning curve of absorbing the defense you know comparing your first year in high school first year at Saddleback first year here how's that learning curve going and how comfortable are you now in the defens of system they have here um I'm really comfortable here um the system is a lot easier than what I had to do in the past um um the the hardest learn C I have to say though when I went to Jo because I used to play Rover safety when I was in high school so I switched to corner so it was like a new transition to playing off Man Press man all the other stuff because I had the ability to do it but um here is just simple you have this you have that so it's a lot easier to do when you have that type of understanding so you're a junior but it's also your first year here where do you fit in the in the pecking order do you get treated like the Freshman by the older guys on the defense um no I don't get treated like the Freshman because um I'm really not a freshman I'm a junior but um I mean I I do have to do some of the things a freshman do like eight hours of study hall all that other type of stuff so I'm still a first year player here so I'm just trying to earn the respect to my teammates and coaches okay speaking of your coaches tell us a little about Dereck Odum what have you learned about him that you didn't know when you came on your recruiting visit um coach odm's a real cool guy um he's he's a little bit tougher on me than most people because this is my first year here and they're asking a lot of me to go into the first game as a starter so he's a lot tougher on me about things that he's not tougher on people about so that that's one thing I did learn about him that he was going to be a little bit more tougher on me than I I expected him but I I'm actually grateful for it because it's making me a better player and I made more plays during here in practice and hopefully it can trans over trans transitions over to the game a lot of players have come in and when they get to start playing for Coach Jones you know he's a laid-back sort of even keeled guy but he still sort of catches some people off guard by the way he runs practice what was your head coach like at Saddleback and and what are the biggest differences um coach Mack was more he he was actually him and Coach Jones are the same type of guy coach mck was real laidback I mean you would see him like sitting down calling plays you know just just real chill guy they're they're really the same um coach coach Mack wants repetition though he wants it over and over again like him and Coach Mack are the same guys that's why I could see why Cole Brandon fitting um Coach Jones system at Hawaii because like they he came from the same type of Coach pretty much so he understood what he was doing so I think that's the comparison to my coaches when you're getting ready for Texas Tech um coach odm said that you've been basically living in his office studying tape with him how much have you been how much time have you've been spending on Troy tape to study the Tendencies of their coordinator and how much have you been spending studying Texas Tech tape to get used to their personnel um about an hour each every day and then I watch Regular film The the Troy and Texas Tech film are kind of the same um the routes are different though so but um when I watch tech tech film I'm going to watch who I'm covering like loudly on D Lewis or whoever other guys are so um but when I watch the Troy if I'm watching the routes but I do watch the tech routes because we really don't know what it's going to be so we just got to be ready for everything that's coming at us so I think we've done a good job of doing that and we hope to execute on Sunday okay you said you're not you don't really know what to expect is this a game where you have to sort of go in just play your base package and adjust on the Fly you can't really have a defensive game plan can you no um yeah that's what we plan to do we're just going to run around pretty much when you run around good things seem to happen so we're just going to basically start out on base and whatever they start doing we're going to adjust coach Mason's a a good coach at doing that he he um stretches to us being a mastermind situations and that's what we're trying to do understand situations so he's putting us in all situations possible that they could do so I think we're going to be ready going into Camp the Red Raiders had a bit of a quarterback battle going on um and stepen Sheffield was the more mobile scrambling guy Taylor Potts who ended up getting the job is more of a stay-at-home dropback kind of pass pass which is easier for you to defend do you or do you have a preference um not really a preference um because for secondary we're just going to be in coverage um no matter what the deal is but um they're both they're both good quarterbacks um I actually expect to see both of them because um Sheffield brings that running aspect and he can throw and Potts is a pocket passer I just expect to see both of them even though they announce pasta star we've been preparing for both of them so we're we're going to be ready on Sunday with Coach leech leaving Texas Tech after last year some people have the assumption that they're not going to throw the ball nearly as much but Coach Brown when he was at Troy they put the ball in the air an awful lot what kind of balance do you expect between run and pass from the Red Raiders um about 53% pass 47% run that's what their balance is um when he was at Troy it's just that it's somewhere around there it's just that they had run so many offensive plays it looks like they are pass heav team but they do run the ball and I we expect bats to get over probably like 15 20 caros so we're I think we'll be ready for all that to be honest when you look at the Texas Tech uh tape and your scouting which receivers do you plan do you expect to be matched up with and who looks particularly impressive to you um we I expect it to be a matched up against L Leon um drron Lewis um the other two guys they have um but um I think mainly Leon's the outside receiver and drron Lewis um he's real he's real impressive on film really really quick guy he kind of reminds us of of crab tree how he move moves with the ball and everything so um we've been preparing for all all the receivers they actually have eight that we've seen in the game so we're we're preparing for all those guys you got a lot of uh you got banjo and Sterling back but there's a lot of new faces in your secondary how confident are you going in to your opener against a big team and in front of a big crowd like that with a lot of new faces um I don't look at it as a big team I look at it as playing football and we've been preparing here and our I I believe that we have like the best group of receivers around so we've been preparing with those receivers so I think the game is going to be the same as practice as long as we've been doing what we do in practice I think we we should be fine um the two new faces um Ryan knows everything that he's doing and it's a helpful thing to me too I pretty much know everything I'm doing too so we're not going to have any mental Bust or anything like that hopefully I mean hopefully we won't have any mental bus we shouldn't but um I we're going to be ready for Sunday make sure that"

        "transcript": "my name is Ryan O'Hara I'm the quarterback coach at Mount San Antonio College here's a look at our drill work this is the Live Pocket movement where we'll have two quarterbacks simulate a rush he's going to evade reset his feet put his back foot on the ground and get the ball out he's either moving up in the pocket or laterally side stepping here's a good look at a wide Rush where he's going to step up in the pocket keep a base and make a good throw down the field it's important to keep your feet apart keep your posture up and your knees flexed here's our eye manipulation with two ball drill we're working on three with the hitch and the ball off that first hitch moving the safety with our eyes and skimming that ball over top of the backer and under the safety for verts versus cover three here he's looking off to safety and he's skimming that ball over the backer here's our quick setup and throw drill where we're transitioning from being outside of the pocket transitioning from a full Sprint to setting our feet to get the ball out that here working toward our left he's going to have to flip his hips get his front side in line and get the ball out here's a back pedal quick setup and throw you'll see the quarterback Sprint out of the pocket quickly set his feet get his back foot in the ground and drive the ball here's a backpedal quick setup and throw where we're going to also flip the hips this is good for things like play action and uh getting your hips around and your front side aligned setting to a good base again getting all your cleats in the ground and lowering your center of gravity and then pushing energy up through the ground to create Ground Force here you'll see him snap that front shoulder just like you did in the drill get aligned and get the ball out in a tight window um here's our base walk drill okay we're going to slow it down so that that that way they can feel their base from shoulder width to slightly outside of shoulder width speed it up a little bit we want them to get not flat footed on the balls of their feet and we want them to move quick but again we want to keep their center of gravity low so that they're nice and strong in the pocket and that they can generate energy up through the ground okay we always want them to set for depth make the rush chase you back and push up in the pocket here you'll see a good good shot of him working his base he's going to set for three at the hitch and he's just working his base the Bas also works if you're waiting for a receiver to develop it keeps you in Balance here's now where they're working their base what we call this hip turn where they're snapping their eyes in their front side to each progression of their read you'll see them look left look right and then come back down the midline and make a throw they want to tie their eyes together with their front foot that way they're always pushing their front side to where they want to throw he's going to take three with the hitch he's looking to his left it's not there he's going to snap his eyes at the backs side close his front shoulder and make the throw always keeping your front side tied together your posture up and your knees flexed here you'll see he's going through quite a bit of reads one two three and then he's coming back to four late okay and he ends up throwing a touchdown but it was all because he worked his base and he he pushed his front side to the Target here's working our base but we're moving forward back side to side subtle movements oh always staying alive in the pocket rarely ever you're just going to be able to stay straight behind the midline you're always going to be moving forward side backwards and uh as you're moving when you're pushing forward you want to push through the back foot when you're working backwards you want to push through the front foot this is a reactionary drill so I'll give a fire call this is our lateral pocket movement drill where he's going to either step up I'll give him a up call around the cones or I'll say side and he's going to side step on his right foot his back foot if he's a left it's his left foot okay want to move quick with urgency short quick movements we always want to graze the grass keep your feet close to the ground stick your back foot in when you're ready to throw and get the ball out here he had a little bit of pressure so he stepped up and then he had a slightly side step stick his back foot on the ground and get the ball out this is long drop fast eyes we're going to do a continuous drop we want to get a big reach step and a small cross and I'm holding up those numbers as fast as I can to get them uh using their eyes quickly and they're calling out the numbers now we'll come right back with the throwing on the run I call this push snap fire they're going to snap their front shoulder for three steps they're going to throw off the same foot they're going to throw off the same foot if they're a righty it would be their right foot if they're a lefty their left foot this is our gather steps this is the top of our three on time drop okay you'll see a shotgun three on time he's throwing the 10 yard out into the boundary he hits his third step he gets the ball out if he's any later he he he doesn't get that ball off cuz we had a free rusher hit him so it's important on timing patterns to hit your back foot and you're going one big and two little close your front shoulder and get the ball off okay this is our base to Hitch he's going to set with the wide base cleat in the ground short hitch and get the ball out you see a three with the hitch he sees safeties rotate he's going to work to his backside two on two he's throwing the curl and he's sitting with the base and having a short hitch and he gets the ball out for a big first down thank you for your time"

        "transcript": "that at last we had found the Patriarchs in history turns out it was a mistaken reading and the datea is off anyway and now that we know more about the site of EA in North Syria we can't make that connection either now what I want to do is to turn to the slides and show you some of the things we've been talking about in rather rapid fashion and then come back to the end to a to ask the question of whether there is indeed any history that we can recover archaeologically from these stories as we have them in the Hebrew Bible and at the end we'll have time perhaps for some questions or two so let us go now to some illustrations I want to deal with what we call the Fertile Crescent that is that long arch of green uh surrounding the desert stretching all the way from the Arabian Persian Gulf at the right lower part of the screen up through the Tigers Euphrates valleys up through Syria down into The aranes Valleys in Syria and Lebanon down into the Jordan Valley in Israel and Jordan and of course it is back and forth along that Crescent that pastoral nomads have always ranged not settling in the river valleys as agriculturalists or urbanites but rather pursuing a pastoral lifestyle moving seasonally with their flocks and they move particularly in The Fringe zone between the green and the brown here that is to say in the area of 4 to 8 Ines of annual rainfall which is too little to sustain crops but is adequate for pasture land so it's clear the biblical stories are set along the fringes of the Fertile Crescent that much is realistic and Nomads are still to be seen in those areas today as we will note in a moment now if you go to Syria today or Iraq or Iran you still see uh modern cities on the remains of ancient wall cities but yet in the shadow of the city walls you still see farmers and Nomads and these various Lifestyles have coexisted from very early times so again the descriptions of town life and of urban life in the Bible are realistic on the basis of what we know on the outskirts of Baghdad which I wouldn't recommend visiting just at the moment uh you will see the remains of ancient Sumerian temples dating before 3,000 BC in other words already there were flourishing Urban civilizations in Mesopotamia at least 1500 years before the Bible places Abraham there here you see a modern reconstruction of one of these ancient Sumerian temples Monumental architecture before 3000 BC here's an artist notion of what one of these Temple complexes looked like it's not only a temple it's a scribal school uh it's a commercial District uh perhaps a third of the population and a third of the domestic uh product went into the temple and the temple economy and the society in other words religion was at the very heart of these early Mesopotamian city states long before the time of an Abraham here's another artist notion of the reconstruction of Life at Ur and this is a banquet scene in the background notice you see the zigurat the stepped Temple Tower this of course reminds you of the story in Genesis 11 of the building of the Tower of Babel and Scholars have long pointed that out now that happen still to stand and here it is partly reconstructed on the basis of Sir Leonard woolly's excavations uh my wife and I once spent one night camping on top of this and nearly died both from denter and from a dust storm that came up but this is the zigarette and it dates already at least 2300 BC again uh Mesopotamia southern Mesopotamia was not a Backwater if there was an age of Abraham in the early second Millennium already there were gods and goddesses everywhere Cults of all kinds flourished uh the text that we have if they're not economic almost certainly deal with religious life uh so and Abraham living in Ure would have been very familiar with Mesopotamian polytheistic religions the gods were almost always paired and yet it was a new and different God who appears to him uh in the biblical stories now uh among the other Innovations of Sumerian nadian civilization in Mesopotamia was writing and here we see an artist notion of a scribal school uh young men are learning to write in cuniform using styling and writing on clay and indeed we have a vast amount of literature from the ancient near East here for example is a cuniform document this is the famous Babylonian flood account which is very similar to the flood story we have in the Hebrew Bible astonishingly similar and yet it has to be at least a thousand years older so we're dealing with a literate Society in other words if there wasn't Abraham living there at the time he would not have been a country bumkin he might have been an educated person and a sophisticated worldly person there was a great deal of wealth in these cities this is now in the Philadelphia University Museum and part of the uh uh Royal Cemetery that woolly excavated a lovely harp uh in lapis Luli and gold uh it was found in a tomb in which a queen was buried with 67 of her servants who had probably been slaughtered to accompany her in death so we have a wealthy and complex highly stratified Society in Ur the very City mentioned in the stories here however we see that not everybody was an elite uh there were some people who were just trying to get by more or less as the middle class is today uh and they they took their sorrows out to an occasional party and this is a party scene they're drinking beer uh from a typical uh a Cadian jar with a long strw we actually have artistic representations and we have the recipes for making the beer I've tried it it's not really very good but uh it was the best they had so we can reconstruct life in the city of UR in surprising detail at all levels of society as the result of archaeological excavations over nearly a hundred years now"

        "transcript": "hey what's up guys Benny here and welcome to today's video where we're going to be taking a look at the arena game mode for Halo 5 Guardians I got an awesome opportunity to play w at Gamescom with a few other YouTubers Alia vixar and Wiz for those of you wondering what the arena game mode is it's the more competitive game mode in Halo 5 compared to war zone which we first got our handson at E3 Arena mode is 4v4 and a lot more tactical compared to other game modes you played on Halo in the past because every kill is crucial due to respawn times if your entire team gets killed in quick succession in an objective game mode like Capture the Flag it could lose you the game the main thing arena is for is if you want to play something a little bit more competitive and Esports spectator mode has also been added in allowing casters to commentate over a competitive match like what we got to look at during the Xbox Gamescom conference which has loads of cool additions like allowing you to see the outline of all the players so if someone's hiding behind a wall you can actually see what they're going to do and how they're going to approach the situation which is pretty cool and a really good way to learn how to play now one of the awesome announcements was also the world championship for Halo 5 which is going to have a $1 million prize pool later this year which I'm definitely going to give a shot at winning I think I got a chance but it will be tons of fun and it's going to be really interesting to see how that goes as well but anyway let's get on to my personal Arena experience cuz I got the opportunity to play on two different Maps playing Team slay sadly I didn't get the opportunity to play any objective game modes like Capture the Flag cuz that would have been tons of fun but we did get to see that at the Xbox games conference we got to see a game of Capture the Flag against Epsilon and optic gaming which was absolutely awesome has got me really hyped up for playing this when the game comes out but the thing is I learned so much in just the hours playing cuz I've been playing loads of war zone at E3 and a bit of Gamescom as well and I had to completely change up my Approach To The Arena mode because I was just running out there getting picked off it wasn't really working my team wasn't communicating so the other team was really organized they was saying where everyone was and we just got destroyed in the first game I think it was like 27 to us to 50 to them so we got pretty walked over and the game play you guys are watching was my team's personal best game where I think we won it from like about 50 to 20 kills had tons of fun but the biggest tip I can give you is communication if you're working together if you're helping each other pick up kills you're far more likely to win the game cuz you can say if you've got an opponent on one shot so your teammate knows they can challenge and pick up that kill and it's an amazing progression of how you start working with your team in Arena cuz every kill is vital if you let your team just kind of run off and do their own thing and you're just like not paying attention to what they're doing you're just going to get killed over and over again especially in less forgiving game modes like Capture the Flag where you suddenly just get taken out and they've got a flag capture and you're going to lose the game but it's tons of fun definitely give it a chance chance when you get your hands on the game really excited about seeing competitive in Esports it's just really fun and and you just get really into it every single kill feels really rewarding uh but guys let me know what you think about Halo 5 Guardians arena in the comments below I'm really interested to hear your opinion and are you going to be going for that world championship $1 million cuz that would be absolutely insane but drop a thumbs up if you enjoy the video make sure to subscribe so you don't miss out on any more Xbox One content right here tons more from games con and more Halo 5 content coming in the future I will see you guys next time hope you enjoyed this game play and bye [Music]"

        "transcript": "hey guys oh my gosh i'm so happy i was getting ready to record and i checked my subscribers or my youtube page and i just reached 1 000. i'm so happy i can't i can't even describe how happy i am this is kind of a big deal for me because when i first started on youtube my like initial goal was getting to one thousand i said if i get to 1 000 it's like i should keep going and i can do this and now that i have and i get all these positive comments and all the support that i get from you guys i really feel like i can't do it and it makes me unbelievably happy so yeah i just checked my page and i have 1005 subscribers i don't even know what to say honestly i'm so overwhelmed right now but yeah i was getting ready to record and i'm half kind of half wearing no makeup that's because i'm going to show you my daily or not my daily but like a simple daily eye makeup look that's a little bit more sophisticated than like just wearing mascara and concealer or whatever and it is using my where are you my favorite naked palette so yeah i'm going to show you how to do my eye make how i do my eye makeup um i can't even talk because i'm so excited anyway i'm just going to get right to it so before you start off you want to prime your lids or just apply some concealer all over your lids which is what i usually do when i'm in a hurry and i don't have my eye primer and after that i'm just going to choose the lightest shade on my negan palette it's called virgin and i'm going to sweep that all over my lid all the way up to my brow bone and in my inner corners and you want to concentrate the color on your brow bone and in your inner corner because those are the areas that we want to highlight and for this i'm just using a fluffy blending brush and my powder is going everywhere like i said i'm just concentrating this color on my brow bones and my inner corners just to highlight now i'm basically just switching up my brush and i'm using a smaller one with tighter packed bristles and i'm going to use this because i'm going to try to concentrate color on some areas now i'm just picking up the color naked and i'm going to blend this into my crease just add some depth and contour now using the very same brush i'm just going to choose a darker color in this case i'm going to choose hustle and i'm just going to add even more depth to that grease this time i'm just going to concentrate the color on the outer v i'm not going to bring it all the way into my crease now we're almost done i told you this is going to be a very simple eye look so what i'm going to do is i'm still using the same brush i'm just going to choose the darkest color that i'm going to use and in this case i'm just going to take the black and we're going to add just a little bit and this time make sure you stay in your outer v don't worry about that we're going to blend it out later now we are almost done the important thing here is that you blend this very well you have to make sure that your brushes are 100 clean before you start blending because if your brushes aren't clean when you blend you're just going to make a mess of colors on your eye and that's not what we're aiming for here to clean your brush you don't really need like a fancy brush cleaner or anything what i'm doing is i'm just taking a piece of paper and just rubbing my brush onto it and getting all that color out of it okay now once your brush is clean you're just going to take all those colors that you already put on your eyelids don't add anything else and you're gonna blend it out once you blend those colors together like seamlessly it's gonna make a huge difference how easy was that you're just using three colors and you're adding depth and dimension and you're making your eyes seem wide awake and you're just lifting your entire face up and that's what that does when you concentrate lighter colors on the inner corners and then gradually turn into darker as you approach the outer corner of your eye it just makes your eyes seem awake and it lifts them up and makes you seem even more youthful if you want if you have smaller eyes which is what i do i kind of have small eyes you can extend the darker color down to the outer corner of your bottom lash line if that makes sense which will make your eyes seem a little bit bigger so i'm just going to use the intermediate cone that i used which was hustle and i'm going to drag that down just a little bit to my lower eyelash just for the finishing touches all you need to do is add a little bit of mascara depending on how you like your mascara i usually like two or three coats and you are done here's a little trick when you have hard to reach lashes it's easier if instead of holding the mascara wand horizontally you hold it vertically tada i am done with my eyes this is basically what i wear on a daily basis whenever i kind of want to wear something more than just mascara like i said earlier and it basically takes five minutes once you get used to how you apply it and you can just do this and be out the door in a flash or a blink of an eye yeah and if you want to make it a little bit more sophisticated you can just add a pop of color on your lips because it's not like very overwhelming so it won't look bad i really like how red looks with this and i know i shouldn't be talking while i'm applying this now for daily use i usually don't go for lipsticks because they're just a little bit heavy for my taste so i go for lip stains or lip tints or something like that and today i chose the revlon just been kissable which is one of my favorite lip products ever in the shade romantic which is just a basic normal red i guess and voila this is my finished look i hope you enjoyed my easy eye makeup tutorial using my naked palette if you don't have the naked palette you could just use any light medium and darker shade i basically just showed you how to apply those on your eyes to make them look more awake i hope this was helpful and if you like this kind of videos if you like this video want me to do more kind of short easy tutorials leave me a like so i know that you did and thank you for all your amazing comments and your support as always and a million kisses your way thank you for watching and take care basically girl thanks a lot what did you think i was doing talking to myself"

        "transcript": "foreign hi and welcome back to toy hobby review on YouTube today we are reviewing the Jackal mobile missile launcher and uh it includes a charger which is uh you plug into the wall to a typical uh 110 and uh the remote control have over here is uh runs off a 9 volt battery just one of them and uh the unit itself runs a 7.2 volt nikad battery so you do not want to charge this more than five hours as the manual says I charge it for about four hours and 30 minutes to five hours but never more than five hours and then it it fits nicely and and snugly in here which is uh and then they have a nice turn release no screws that you can strip or anything like that okay so as you can see uh I had to turn ready to go in action and uh to move it left and right in the rear there are left and right buttons for turning the current and in the front there's two buttons that you have to press simultaneously at the same time for it to Fire and if you hold them down it will do automatic fire shot all right so how about we see this emotions foreign four and a half hours of charge time and about I'd say about 13 minutes of run time seems a little short but those are 13 minutes that are very fun because this is quite entertaining to be able to shoot missiles out and uh drive around and aim it and whatnot and it responds very well to the controls but uh once again the charge time kind of let me down thank you for watching toy hobby review on the ignite jackal um please subscribe and I appreciate it take care foreign"

        "transcript": "[Music] hey everybody Rox the box of 90 here with a special opening you know those times that you come home home and you ordered a game magazine or you ordered up some cards from any given website and you come to your front door and lo and behold there's a package waiting for you you're not 100% sure what it is it could be anything but you're hoping that it could be something special and that's pretty much what happens when you open something like this which is what's called a Mazy box so what is Mazy box Mazy box is a Kickstarter just started on kickstarter.com and what they do is they're putting together a program to ship out monthly boxes such as this containing surprise stuff on their Kickstarter they have a whole bunch of options to select for people who are donating but this one is one of the options and it is a magic the Gathering box so let's break it open and see what sort of stuff if you got a Mazi box what would you get inside so first you get this newsletter and they have here a budget deck of the month which is put together and designed to be fairly cheap but also standard relevant for people who like to build for local F&M or build more interesting unique builds that are not just mono X devotion they put in a deck for you and they also break down some ways to use the deck against current standard decks which is really cool I have to say not many people are thinking about players regularly getting new decks and most of the time people are just throwing up you know constructed Decks that have already been built over and over again by lots of other people and not trying to make new stuff so that's really cool to have that inside the box it says you get three Theos packs two packs of Ultra Pro sleeves two a a 20-sided diee and in this box you get JoJo's jerky which we'll we'll check out what that is and a newsletter so the price the total retail value of this box is about $33 and if you put in towards the kickstarter you actually get it for cheaper so the more that we put in towards a quickstarter the idea being that you'll get back more and more return on the investment which is really cool I have to say people who put themselves on Kickstarter very impressive to do that and of course they have a big thank you to everybody and they're actually going to see other channels opening up Mazy box too so let's we heard what's inside of it let's check out so it comes with a nice nice tissue paper we get as they said you get three packs of th opening this box is kind of like opening packs you don't know 100% what you're going to get because it's not always the same even though at least the basics are the same so here we have Legion sleeves I've actually used these before they hold up pretty well for sleeves they're not the rounded edges ones which they said they may be including in future boxes If they raise enough money for their project and round sleeves are very cool I have to say but these are also very awesome and the color is great choice I like the dark color the very light ones often get scuff and dirty very easily these are I think better so that's really awesome you get 100 total sleeves that fits any deck even an EDH deck for players who need EDH This Is 50 and 50 so you get 100 sleeves in the box then we get a 20 sided die so you guys have all seen these before they uh they're always useful you can always use them in any deck you're playing you get these in the Box as well and then we get some beef jerky in this pack from a Las Vegas Place Las Vegas and it is Jojo pepper jerky it looks pretty good looks pretty good so hold on we'll hold off on that let's open up the packs when you guys put in for this you're not only helping a group who I think are really trying to help players who used to have the experience where you get like a video game subscription or you get cards coming to your door that whole opening experience that's really what they're trying to capture here and I think it's a really nice thing to support so we have an Artis in Sor Helio's Emissary shipwreck singer and Temple of Triumph the temples are always awesome with a foiled favored hoplight and it's always exciting to open packs so they're really trying to make the Mazy box something that is fun to open as well we got here some Commons these are three Theos packs an ordal of peros prowler's Helm favorite hopl which got a foil one and a labyrinth champion and and that that's the the rare So what they're really trying to do is hopefully in future boxes have some surprises that include include things like special tokens that look really great I'll post the link here for you guys to check it out and also rounded sleeves and all sorts of other goodies so the more they can raise the more that the people who put in will get back which is really I think a very nice turn for such a project like this and our RAR is a Mis cutter Hydra that's a fantastic card in today's standard we also have the spell C which is a monster unlimited actually these packs are not bad at all we got a temple of Triumph a labyrinth Champion which is okay and a Mis cutter Hydra these are the real standard playable cards at the end of the day this is what came in the Mazy box from them and while you're pretty much guaranteed when you put in for the magic box which this is then you're guaranteed packs and you're guaranteed sleeves and you're guaranteed other fun stuff you really can't lose by putting into this and I think they're also really trying to help other small businesses and they're reaching out to network with other magic of the Gathering kickstarters as well as mag the Gathering businesses and they're hopefully going to incorporate things like we were talking about with the minus minus counters or the plus plus the plus one plus1 counters which I'll also put a link in so you guys can check that out as well they really want to incorporate a lot of different business I know I'm definitely going to be supporting them and I really suggest you guys go check out their Kickstarter link I'll put it here they're working hard to make this the best product they can and I think if we could put in to help with them it would be really awesome so you guys can get involved at the kickstarter link which I'll put here I'll also put it in the description and as always Rox box 90 signing out see you guys next time"
