        "transcript": "let's push this daniel farkas and we're back with another karate technique today we're going to talk about the spinning back kick which is so often used in karate spinning basket basically as we spin around throw a basket to your opponent now there are certain things that you must remember don't want obviously it's an advanced technique so before you can do this thing you must be relatively high belt and you must have good balance and good coordination but there's certain tricks now watch very carefully so what i want you to do is and then the seconds as his head went his back foot kicks out and go good now you already things that the big mistakes people tend to watch and the finest things now oftentimes when you're in a fighting stance you have a tendency to get kicked into the water okay your feet tend to be a little wide and the reason you do that is because it puts your own balance now this is what happens to a lot of people they either intend to do something backwards in that position don't move see how you're literally off balance see that okay so the first thing you have to learn that whenever you are going to do a spinning back kick you get into what we call a very narrow stance narrow stance now narrow stance is simply a fighting stance in which your two heels are literally lined together it's almost like any back stance in which your heels are lined up the only difference is you're a little more forward okay you see somebody standing in the fighting stance so what you want to do is keep your foot narrow now i don't have to do anything extreme boom boom and there you go see that so don't ever let your feet move in front of your chin the second thing is don't move the foot before you move the because your body is going to rotate your foot can make a lot of stronger so keep in mind two things number one always narrow stage number two motivate the body first and then go again and make sure that when you throw your kick you're focusing on the heel not on the toe as if you kick with the toe you're going to break your toes and you're going to minimize the amount of damage that you can lead to your opponent so always kick with the heel and that one other thing whenever you are practicing the spinning back just that over here what happens is and because of the fact that you spent nine out of ten times and you see this all and watch carefully see that really it looks like a good kid but i was kicking jake here i want so you have to be really careful that when you do it because keep in mind even though we call this a spinning backhand you are not really spinning what you're doing is turning but look so keep in mind you're turning and kicking even though everybody crosses the stream back a real spin is something that you really go all the way around the medicine that's a spin but a straight back all right remember to practice spinning back kicks in the air is wonderful except that nine out of ten times you really don't know when you're hitting the target i should just go straight back in here right but you notice it could be there here unless you have a target you're really never going to be perfect with that kick so the best thing to do is always work on the target you have a target in front of you right here oh"

        "transcript": "I'm here with four-time New York's leading trainer Gary Contessa Gary please tell us what goes into a racehorses nutrition well you eat each racehorse just like any human athlete is a different personality and a different composition so not every horse gets fed exactly the same some need more some needs less some need different supplements and we try and accomplish those needs through their feed program the basic feed program is kind of what you see here we use we use a feed called steak horse or and we also use hallway feeds and it's a complete feeder and the feed has a molasses it has a pellet in it it has a sweet feed as barley it has crimped oats it has all the things that a horse needs to get the proper manner of nutrition we try and keep the protein level in a horse between 12 and 14 percent protein so this is a this is a 14 percent protein feed we augment it with a little bit of a whole out and that probably drops the protein just a bit and we try and keep we keep track of their their carbs we keep track of the protein level and we keep track of the vitamins so these complete feeds that we use sup are perfect for the horses basic needs now as you get to know your horses we also add corn oil corn oil reduces lactic acid in the muscles we add corn oil to their feed we also add different vitamin supplements if you swing over here I'll show you a one of our one of our vitamin supplements is a product called red cell it's iron rich it's got a lot of the vitamins that they won't get from the basic feed now there's a lot of these out on the market red glow red cell that you know a lot of different attack people make their own type of this but this kind of gives you a horse the the extra stuff that they need to make to meet their minimum daily requirements on their vitamins just like a human you know everything you read these days for humans is 25% of your minimum daily requirements 50% 100% I was drinking orange juice the other day said one glass orange juice is 100 percent of your vitamin C that you need for you know for a daily intake and so so we try to meet those minimum requirements and erase loss as well and in other situations you get horses that need more or less protein as the case may be we have a we have a condition that occurs a lot in fillies but it does occur in cults - it's called timing up it's like a charley horse to a human being the muscles get very tight you know most people have had a charley horse in the middle of the night or you know you're sitting somewhere and you get that your muscle tightens up and it's painful it's excruciating pain and it's that way for the horse - we have found in horses that have that repeat over and over and over again we reduce that protein to below 10% we keep their cob side but we reduced their protein below 10% and it and it diminishes the amount of times that that situation is going to come up where they tie up it's one of the things we do to help them not tie up tying up they say is a you know just way too much lactic acid causes the muscles to bind and you get this Charlie life situation and a horse it's very very painful they can barely walk and it's a very common thing it happens quite often especially in fillies so we reduce the protein level so like I said the feed program in anybody's barn whether it's you know no matter what trainer it is is specialized per horse and it's an individual thing so we have the basic feed that you've seen but we supplement to meet that particular horses needs with different vitamin programs and different supplements so every loss is an individual and there's no standard blanket feed that you give any particular horse we have lists and lists and lists of this or skits this this was gets that and it meets the needs of each individual certain trainers have certain preferences for certain feeds definitely years ago it used to be just old some sweet feet and brand and today they all have specialized different ratios that are using some people like Todd Pletcher have their own Chad Brown has his own they are made for their specific needs there's a million different kinds of feed today compared to 50 years ago when it was only four or five what kind what kind of specialty feeds do you see trainers using now different makeup of the ingredients basically is what it is they do a workup with a nutritionist and then they try to put together what they feel they need to get the most out of their horses do you ever see a case where trainers at in a bad spell and then they change feed I have seen there's lots of times I have seen that lots of times and I don't honestly know if that's the answer sometimes it is sometimes it isn't now in a typical day how much and how often will a racehorse eat we we feed our horses three times a day we feed them after they get done training which is about now today's a little late because we had turf workouts but between 10 and 11 o'clock they get what we would consider their breakfast breakfast is about four quarts of beet one of these scoops this scoop is what we consider two quarts of beef they'll get two of these for breakfast they'll get about three of these for dinner that's that's ten quarts and then at 3 o'clock in the morning our night watchman comes by and gives them another scoop if they've finished their dinner so we try and keep our horses between 12 and 14 quarts of feed a day and that's in this roughage now you'll see you've been watching this horse over here he's been eating hay at the hole the whole time we're talking that's roughage for a horse this is a little bit of protein in there but that's it that's roughage it helps keep them flowing on the inside helps keep them from getting bored there is nutrients in there there is there is essential vitamins in there we give them Copwatch they can eat as much of that hay as they want and it doesn't figure in the feed program them the bulk of the feed program the basis the foundation of our feed program is in the actual grain that we give them in the supplements the scientific testing that we do to make sure that our horses are maintaining the proper levels our blood tests we don't do urine tests on horses we don't do so we do spill samples to determine whether or not they have worms but we do blood tests to make sure that their red blood cells are good that you're wiped out where they belong that their muscle enzymes we actually can do a muscle enzyme test to know if that horse is high or low so we determine where our horses are at as far as nutrition goes through blood tests which we probably do about twice a month for every single horse in the barn it's like feeding a world-class athlete that can't tell you what he needs you have to guess what that athlete needs you know an athlete can say to your man I need more salt on my food all right you know or I'm just feeling lightheaded I need I need some more carbs or I need some fluids these horses can't tell you anything you know they don't tell you anything it's all body language so we have to use the body language of the horse to determine what's how that horse is and how he's doing and we add the blood tests and whatnot and that's how we we maintain so it's quite quite an interesting program and it's a lot of work yes Oh"

        "transcript": "[Music] sometimes i like to pretend that i'm a rapper so with that being said imma give you guys just one just one quick rhyme we finally have some diversity here in op why because we have another black guy oh what's up everybody my name is ron and uh that was so cheesy wasn't it oh man that's the best i could do but this game plays at 216.4 with the scar by esv is not my game plays by sv i'm not too sure what his perk setup was or what attachment he was using on his gun so if you want to you can drop a comment below and i'm sure he'll get back to you but what i really wanted to talk about and oh just let me mention his predators are pretty off and if you know sv i just want to say stay away from drugs and your predator missiles will not be like his at all so on to this commentary i'm sorry i had to throw it out there i see a lot of people going from black ops 2 now they're playing mw3 again and it's not something i would do personally because i had a lot of horrible and bad times on this game i was raging matter of fact me raging at this game i raged more than jay nasty not taking those shots but i reached more than that and that's not something i do it looks weird especially when i catch myself in a rage just screaming and then i think to myself why am i screaming for it but i have a baby face and i'm gonna tell you why i'm bringing up this baby face right i'm 19 i look like i'm 16 and a half maybe 17 now because i started working out so those hormones are starting to kick in real nice but i had no facial hair at the end of this game when the lifespan was over i had a full rick ross beard how does it make any sense but this is all thoughts and opinions on this commentary what i would change about this game and how they can learn from past mistakes and make a better call of duty so with that being said let me get straight into it number one now this has stopped me from getting so game plays you know hundred plus and stuff like that because you can't find anybody assassinate i'll tell you why i hate these two things because one assassin you can't counter it uav eventually v you can't counter it at all only way you can is that if you have a full party with recon throwing stun grenades or you know nades and stuff like that and paint them on a mini mat but if you're solo it's a pain because you have little timothy and a corner no fingertips no fingernails and he's just invisible from the world with no penalty and if you use to sell killstreaks blonde eye you're basically not going to get any kills and i had 140 000 kills and i would say 138 000 were all specialists so i think that they need to add a counter for assassinate because i don't like to play hide and go seek as a ghetto chick would say ain't nobody got time for that ain't nobody got time for that no no no we just don't got time for it now i just lost count so uh is it two or three my bad but one thing i would like to see return is that don't you know how black ops one you can shoot and you can actually take cover or run away from that gun fight now if you try to run away somebody can shoot you through a wall you're dead in one bullet and i'm about to bring up this little timmy reference again i don't like how little timmy no fingertips no thumbs he can sit in a corner and basically shoot you and your leg two times bow bow and you're dead instantly i like black ops one where you can actually escape gun fights the person with the best gun skill or the best aim can actually win and it adds that skill gap into public matches and it's not really that much in public matches at all people just throw c4s and stuff like that but next one i would change is that support kill streak should not be in here maybe support kill streaks in a sense but if you die and oh my god come on sv with some of these predators i told you stay away from drugs stay away but just reset it's not fair when somebody who sits in the back of the mat you know play the most asshole-ish way possible and he can still get kill streaks especially in ground war if you play growler in this game stealth bomber stone bomber stealth bomber just take it out me personally i think that the sub bomber should have just been in the soap package like it's common sense it's common sense but the next two things now might get some people mad with snipers i'm sorry i'm sorry don't hate me for it but i like black ops one sniping again you don't ads faster than the p90 or mp7 they are submachine guns so it's only logical that you shoot in ads faster than those guys so just slow down the 80s time you shouldn't ads that fast with a sniper that's all that's all i want to take away from a sniper so don't start a riot and the last one is death streaks which is you know duh players they don't get better by giving them death streaks they don't get better at all it plots in real life also you get beat a few times you get beat until you know you can't take it and then you eventually practice and you get better yes i just apply cod to real life get at me but that's all i hope you guys enjoyed this video in this commentary my name is ron yakpack juice life thug life only good stuff you already know if you get to know me you'll know what that actually means so final score 216 and four leave a like if you enjoyed and uh come out peace [Music] so [Music] you"

like some kind of action movie out there you here like some Joe things like that that's him watching a movie before I do the unboxing I just wanted to tell you guys about a movie that I saw today we went install Jack the giant slayer and i loved it i am actually pretty easy to please when it comes to you know movies I generally like a lot of things this one was actually really good though I think a lot of people will like it was action packed and it had a little bit of romance in it and um me and my husband we have very different tastes in movies so if there's ever something that we both like which we both like this it's like really cool so I've been in a good mood ever since on to the unboxing I am doing a beyond the rack unboxing and just a really quick little bit about beyond the rack it's sort of like hot look um rue la la it's like a sail flash sale site sort of thing you get ten dollars for every person that you refer to din and somehow a long time ago I put out my referral link and a bunch of people click on it and sign up so I ended up with a $65 credit on beyond the rack so the other day they have some like cell phone cases and headphone and things like that on there so i bought right around 65 dollars worth of stuff i just had a paste shipping which was 9 95 which is a little in the steep side but i figured for all that stuff you can't beat that this is the box the big box there's the beyond the beyond the rack it's a big box and I don't really know why it's such a big box because there's not a lot of stuff in it I can show you one of the things I already got it this came separately from the rest of my stuff so I they do ship things to you as they get them and the shipping is sometimes a little sub par and leaves a lot to be desired this stuff actually came pretty fast this is the first case that i'm going to show you is a sparkly hot pink haze and I love it I couldn't wait to go to work and show it off to everybody is like check out my new skirt a pancake it's the front um you can't think on the front it looks like you're not your daughter the case which i love I'm sorry about these things on my shirt you all there a big pain in the butt and I

        "transcript": "hello again guys it's Ian a car camera shop again today a short unboxing video this time of the the hugely popular Mobius action camera that we pre configured as a dash cam and supply with all the bits and pieces you need to just get that plugged in and working straight away put that to one side packaging isn't too excited I appreciate that so let's get straight in here so the first thing you'll see is just a quick letter from us just just brief overview of what the camera is how we've configured it and the the camera doesn't come with a user manual so we'll just some links as to where you can find that information the good thing about the Mobius luck say it's usually popular and there's there's a lot a wealth of information online some of it on our site some of it on community sites so any questions you have by all means drop us a line but there's also say a huge amount of information online which is testament to just how popular this camera is so without further ado here's the camera itself let's just take this out here this is the standard lens and exist one side this is the standard lens and just for comparison this is the wide angle lens these are pros and cons some people fur one over the other if you're not sure which would be best for you there's a video on our YouTube channel which is probably the best starting point but she's just a side-by-side comparison say some people throw one over the other but yeah take a look at that and if you're not sure please do drop us a line you get the choice of these there's no extra cost it really comes down to personal preference and I'll put that to one side for now I say this is one of our best selling cameras i think the price the size of it and probably above all the the video quality of this is just exceptional full 1080p 30 frames a second and although this is in our budget camera range and turns a video quality it's certainly up there with the best of them you it lacks other features such as a GPS g-sensor things like that but if you're just looking for a small very discreet reasonably priced camera to record activity on the road ahead well this could very very well be it I'll briefly go over the the bits and pieces on here but the way it's been configured you won't actually need to interact with the camera at all as soon as it detects power it will turn on start recording and as soon as you turn the ignition off or the power is cut it will stop recording simple as that but just briefly here we have some controls shutter button for viewing photo mode a button to change the camera mode a power button some heat sinks here just to help it dissipate the heat and this is where your power would connect via a mini USB cable this is where your memory card would slip in here we have there be an LED here a little reset have you can see those led this where you could reset the camera if necessary another led here and on the front just take the lens cap off is the lens and his microphone this is already already clipped into its mount here it is without the mount so you can see it it's a really low profile mount doesn't actually add too much to the size what it does do is it attaches this and this tripod mount to it which then enables you to connected to either an adhesive mount which is this one here or suction mount again people have their own preference as to which they'd prefer the adhesive mount is semi-permanent a little bit more compact in the suction mount you know you can easily easily take this out of the car but it is a little bit bulkier so pros and cons for both of those again we give you the choice of those no additional costs for either of those am just whichever would suit you best and and it just connects really easily there we go and then it can just be adjusted this would stick onto your your windscreen he would adjust it and then just tighten it up with this so you take a little bit more time and care just to make sure that is that's pointing exactly where you want it and then as you can see that's a really neat little unit very discreet easily hidden behind your your rear-view mirror and if I just take this off if and out but those two one side and see what else we get in the box this is a three meter USB to mini-usb power cable plenty enough cable there to run from your cigarette lighter socket around the dashboard and around your windscreen and up to the camera there's some cable tide is here if you do need them but usually this this cable can be hidden away behind behind trim or underneath carpet but they are there if you need them so that cable would run like I say down to your cigarette lighter and if I can just get this open to a standard USB cigarette lighter adapter there we go and last but not least a little another USB cable this time a little bit shorter more manageable just for plugging the camera into your PC or Mac there's no software per se for this camera but the the mov video files that it creates can be viewed quite easily or on any any machine and this also comes with and this is a little velcro a little piece of velcro some people do use this just as an alternative mounting option is there if you need it and a little the kind of allen key which can be useful when setting in making some fine-tuning so that's everything you need there to get this amazing little camera up and running like say it's pre-configured and so you don't even have to plug it into the computer and configure it as a dashcam we can get it in focus there we go literally take it out a box get it installed memory card in and away you go excited I can't stress enough how good the image quality from this is there's plenty sample footage on our YouTube channel so please do take a look at that and if you have any questions please do drop us a line until then I hope this has been useful and speak soon"

        "transcript": "To me Natural Bodybuilding is the purest form of bodybuilding. Natural bodybuilding is more than just a sport, it's a passion, it's an attitude, it is pure love. My Name is Mischa Janiec, I am 21 years old and from Switzerland. I am now trying to adjust my swiss accent for the interview. I am currently working as a self-employed personal trainer and as a fitness trainer at the gym. I have come to Natural Bodybuilding 3.5 years ago. Reason was that I had scoliosis, I was pretty weird with my spine and I noticed this quickly, when I stood or sat. I then logged on to a physiotherapist, she has taught me some exercises that didn't thrill me. I was very lazy at this time, Thus, it has emerged that I did not do this, I've made it very lazy. I was then sent back to her, she just said you need to do something. And I've come to the gym. This I liked much better. Because of the success I had, I was very motivated within a few month  and that was the reason why I started with the sport. Why I did compete? That was at the 2010 Swiss Cup SNBF, this was my first competition I have seen as a spectator. I was then invited by colleagues whom I've met through the sport. And that night, I saw the junior class. There was the winner of the junior class, the son of the President of the SNBF, Julian Strickler, This night he had been so beautifully symmetrical, he had such a good shape, That blew me away. When I saw that, I just knew I want to do that, too. Next year I'm standing on this stage and will also rock that stage. This year I'm doing completely off-season, 2012 is fully dedicated to building. I have decided that, because I just noticed I have still pretty strong deficits, especially in the back and legs. And in general, even after the entire competition season, I thought to myself, just another year, then I can start really cool in the heavyweight division. I certainly start again in 2013 SNBF and perhaps I would not be averse to a start at the International Class GNBF. That's an option. The aim would certainly be to qualify via SNBF for the World Cup, which would be the plan. My goals over the next few years is to continue Natural Bodybuilding successfully, I will certainly do some contests. That last year was a great experience and I am ambitious and motivated, to get still a lot out of my body. Which, of course, more and more is coming, is the desire to do photo shoots, etc., it gives me a lot of fun. And of course, it would be cool to do motivational videos along with cover shoots like Greg Plitt. That would perhaps eventually overlaps with Natural Bodybuilding because you have certain ideals as a fitness model. Since you can't have 75er or 70 quads, perhaps more important, is to go for definition, mass building would then be neglected. But my goal is certainly to pursue further the sport and just keep fit, most of my life over, till I am no longer able to work out.  That would certainly be my goal."

these are her some of her prospective mates oh really yeah oh oh there's a small yamama Boi down there like right down there yell and uh now how how old would these fish be they range in age from about 6 years old up to about 10 or 11 years old oh really now what is considered age of maturity for a fish like that um it actually goes withing by size the fish hits about 7 to 8 in um or generally four years old so four years so you be adult yeah then they're big enough to spawn okay wonderful and they're originally the breed is from Japan yes it was um in in areas of like surrounding uh in in Asia all the brood stock and stuff um the Chinese actually uh bread koi as well okay um so they had a part in it um but they the famous source of a lot of quality koi is Japan the Nagata areas uh especially okay there an interesting one over there he's yellow and he actually has red eyes he's bar barfing there nibbling at the Le that fish has red eyes he's what they call akame Benny boy and he's actually an albino version of an orange fish you kidding NOP there he is right there looking right up oh yeah you can see the shine of his eyes yes I can his eyes kind of shine like a like an albino rabbit right yeah wow that's fascinating now how many times a day do these guys eat um they'd eat any time all the time oh so whenever you feed them they will yeah but generally they get fed three times a day okay um in a pet Pond depending on the fish you've got to be very careful not to overfeed that's one of the the biggest problems is overstocking or overfeeding of a pond causes the collapse of the of the uh of the biobalance you want to be very careful people think automatically because we're fish breeders we promote lots of fish or put lots of fish but we don't if that's a situation where quality um over quantity always takes precedence you want a couple of really nice fish in your pond as opposed to too many exactly because they just contaminate their own environment and make it very hard to manage the pond and this is I mean there is a bit of an investment involved with these types of fish right how much how much would fish like that cost of this size Japanese Imports of this size can range anywhere from 500 right on up so the sky the limit depending on the pattern the quality the breeder The Source okay um but generally you can probably acquire a nice Japanese fish of a decent size for around 500 or more okay so that's not too bad then that's the price of a pet right yeah exactly and they're quite sociable they like interacting with humans oh they love interacting with people I don't know if they'll come to me because it's already fed I guess they like to come to you more when you have food for them right that's right and these guys all hand feed uh-huh they'll come they don't hurt you at all and it's no shock that this one comes up this color pattern the genetics of this color pattern they're very friendly sociable little fish yeah it's funny this is um this is an oi um he comes from the Chay family they have personalities huh oh absolutely they do and actually the different colors because of the way they've been bred um some some patterns grow larger than others now this white one had sort of a little veil right beside the eyes oh yeah that's actually a little vent that uh covers the nostrils when they shoot forward they don't flood their nostrils with water but they don't all have that or do they no that one is a little more um a little frillier because that was a butterfly koi and the Butterfly all of their appendages are a little fancier so they get a little frillier and on the Butterfly Koi we call that a little pom pom but if you look carefully at these guys they all have those they have it's just smaller yeah hi baby very nice and they like playing in that uh what if a plant is that that actually is water highis and they love eating the roots off of that so we give them to kind of graze on it keeps them happy gives them some natural food source um unfortunately for the plant it won't do as well it then nibbling on the roots yeah but that's also the type of plant that's handy to put in the pond to allow the fish to spawn on or to protect the the babies once they've hatched out gives them a place to hide of course we don't expect any spawning in amongst the males it is it's just a treat for them cool and what temperature do they have to uh stay at throughout the year um anything above 50 like 50\u00b0 um they will they will eat or 10\u00b0 C they will they're they're warm enough they're a cold blooded creature so their environment kind of dictates their metabolism as long as the water's warm enough so 10\u00b0 or 50\u00b0 F and higher they live quite comfortably in water that's quite warm as long as it's consistent they don't like a lot of chemistry or temperature you know wings so very good well this is very interesting and now we're going to move away from the cold flooded animals yes so the warm blood is furry one sure and I'm looking forward to that thank you Laura thank you"

Now when you work with something as versatile\nas Polymer Clay, you are bound to have some questions whether you are a beginner, an intermediate\nor even an expert. So over the years, oh about eight years or\nso, my husband Doug and I have put together a resource PolymerClayTutor.com, where we've\nbeen doing tutorials and answering questions and doing all kinds of things to help you\nfurther your Polymer Clay journey. But as we've been growing, it's becoming more\nand more difficult for me to answer questions individually anymore, so I have a big favor\nto ask you. Now, first of all, I still want all your questions\nto come in, questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, unless you ask them of me, I have no\nidea what you need, and I need to understand what is most difficult for you guys in order\nto come up with the right videos to give you, so keep those questions coming. And another favor I have is if you have the\nanswer, maybe you\u2019ve been around for a while, you know that I've done a video on it in the\npast, help each other out, if you know it\u2026 the answer, then give the answer to the person\nthat's asking, that would be really great, and we've been doing that for a lot of years\non our website and it's made a big difference, people learn a lot from each other, and actually\nwe have almost a 100,000 comments on our blog where people have been interacting and it\nmakes a big difference in your learning experience. And then the last thing is maybe you can find\nthe answer yourself, now on our blog\u2026or on our site, PolymerClayTutor.com, there is\na search box there that if you type in your question\u2026your issue, your topic, whatever\nit is, into the search box, the answer will mostly likely pop up, because there is like\nover a thousand posts, there's 500 videos and like I said, like tens of thousands of\ncomments, those answers are probably gonna pop right up for you and you'll be able to\nfind them right away, alright? So make sure to be using that resource, make\nsure to be interacting with each other and keep the questions coming in, and the suggestions. I read everything, I just can't personally\nrespond to everything anymore, it's a little overwhelming, and if I do\u2026I've spent entire\ndays just answering questions, and I'm having a difficult time getting all the videos and\nstuff done, so if you could help me out, that would be great. So I hope that was helpful for you, if it\nwas, let me know if you liked this video in the comment section below, of course ask whatever\nquestions that it is that you need.

        "transcript": "what's up guys raging Amish here and it's time to finally kick off a new series you guys have asked a lot of questions over the past year and I think it's time for me to answer them we're going to get right into it welcome to ask an Amish man are you actually Amish yep I've got a gas powerered Xbox I have my cat running on a treadmill to power my router and I'm using cups and string for internet cord or maybe I just made all that up to everyone who is curious no I am not Amish I don't have a buggy I don't live on a farm I don't wear suspenders well at least not in public I'm not a member of the Amish church then where the hell did the name come from I chose the name Raging Amish because I wanted to pick an online moniker that would be memorable but also kind of tie to who I am my family was a part of the Amish Church five generations ago my great great-grandfather left the church and my family became menite basically that means I have a lot of the anabaptist beliefs of an Amish man but I use electricity and don't rely on a horse for transport I asked myself what adjective could I add to Amish to make it amusing and easy to remember raging Amish is what came to mind would you answer this question well maybe I could no where did you get the idea for your gun reviews a lot of my inspiration came from Doug Walker or as he's better known The Nostalgia Critic he's the main reviewer over at thatguywiththeglasses.com I'll put a link in the description below so you can check out some of his stuff basically I saw what he was doing and really enjoyed watching his reviews I wanted to get started doing my own videos but I knew I would have to review something that I enjoyed when I finally got down to it I chose Call of Duty because I was hooked to Modern Warfare 2 at the time I loved the diversity of the guns and I figured I could make a review series out of it the rest is history how did you find out about the nostalgic critic that's actually a long story I spent a 6-month semester in Germany where I got introduced to John Carpenter's movies from the80s one of my favorites was the thing I looked that up on YouTube and sure enough I found a guy called spoony who did a review on a video game called the thing I kept watching his videos and eventually spoony did a crossover review for alone in the dark with a Nostalgia Critic from that point on I became a huge fan of Doug Walker has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like well sense May Capper ask you I love you Chuck no homo which has you more pumped Modern Warfare 3 or Battlefield 3 Modern Warfare 3 easily I don't want to bash Battlefield fans but the fact is I've never played Battlefield before I am curious to see how BF3 plays I've heard great things about the PC version but horrible things on the console I plan to review Battlefield 3 for the PS3 when it gets here but I'm definitely more pumped for Modern Warfare 3 will you ever switch to Battlefield at least partially I will not get involved in the battlefield versus Cod argument but the answer is no I thought Battlefield reviews would be a possibility until I played the Battlefield 3 beta I'm not going to judge the game until I play the full release but I did not like what I saw in the beta the graphics seemed Bland the lag was horrible and I did not like that each faction has access to different guns that was really annoying I really am trying to walk into Battlefield 3 with an open mind to give it fair judgment I will buy the game to see what kind of fixes they add after the beta period is over I'm not going to lie the game hasn't looked promising so far Amish if somebody loved the uzi and made it their favorite gun in Black Ops how would you react what do you prefer the Xbox or PS3 controller the Xbox controller hands down hell I'm one of the few people that really like the original Xbox controller from way back when a lot of people wondered how I could like such a big controller here's my response do you know what they say about guys with small hands who is your favorite Cod commentator I'm not going to name just one person it's not fair for me to pick just one because I can name a few I really enjoy if I were to give a top five list in no particular order I'd say try hard ninja ask a Capper Xbox aoy Sean 13 and Skrill AEV I feel I've grown on YouTube with all of these guys in some way shape or form I love their content and it really is a pleasure to watch every video they put out other than Shooters what other genres of games do you enjoy playing and could you give some examples of games in those genres I played a lot of games over the years outside of Shooters I love the mech genre and by that I mean any game that lets you customize a futuristic war machine for combat I love the mech Warrior and mechaa Games mechaa 2 for the Xbox had some of the best multiplayer I've ever experienced I also love the armored Core Series the level of customization in the games is jaw-dropping and mind-bendingly addicting outside of the mech games I also love realtime strategy I played a lot of Age of Empires 2 back in the day and more recently I became addicted to sins of a solar Empire before Cod that's the game I played day in and day out it was definitely different but so much fun all right that's where I'm going to end this episode of ask an aishman thanks for watching and please be sure to give me some new questions in the comments below I love reading reading through them to answer what you guys want to know the rules and guidelines are as follows please limit yourself to one question and go through the list to give a thumbs up to questions you'd like to see answer I'll be back again with this series pretty soon until then remember I'm not Amish take care everyone I'll see you next time [Music]"

        "transcript": "foreign what's up guys this is Tyler from cjk coming at you again with another Minecraft video um I will be showing you today how to make an advanced Horse Pen um there's a traditional one over there but this is how to make one that will keep it in there using some Redstone tricks so here's all the materials you're gonna need for you don't necessarily need a stack of everything um I just happen to have a stack of everything so that's what I'm going to be using for this the basic template for it is going to be three I mean two blocks to the left two blocks to the right and two blocks there with the pressure pads on the front with fence gates in the first space of two then you're gonna cover that with carpet yep the carpet squares there cover up all the fence gates then one Redstone piece is going to go in the closest spot to the carpet then you're gonna build put wood planks here on either side outside of the spaces that you have already dug into the ground then on those you're going to put a sticky piston facing downward down towards the ground you're going to put a sticky piston and then under the sticky piston you are going to put a redstone block so here's the sticky piston goes in right there and you can see it's facing toward the uh towards the ground and to do that you have to get under it and then you want to put the Redstone Block attached to the sticky piston so you're going to go under it to put it there so here it is on the other side sticky piston goes down and then the block of redstone Goes Down Under that one so there's the two sides they should look identical both of these so everything that you do on one side is going to go on the other so just um after that you can build a framework around it and that framework is going to be just like it's shown here it is going to be three all the way across but it'll uh the third one in the back will just jut out a little bit that's just purely for design features you know you just you just want to make it look good um the Redstone functionality is already all done you did that before um when you uh did the Redstone and the redstone block with the sticky piston so that's all done then you're going to put two step pieces across from each other covering up the Piston then you're gonna put wood plank on top of the piston on either side and then from there you're going to take a tripwire hook and put them on both wood plank blocks now it is important to put two pieces of string on there or it won't work so as you can see the tripwire is stretching across both blocks just fine and that is exactly how you would you would want to do it um now we're just going to put some more structure um structure detail on it we're going to cover up the trip wire by putting planks around it and then we're going to make a little roof with some wood slabs there just to uh you know make it look good so that way it's not just a plain old you know just two things on either side we're also going to put step pieces around the back of it so the horse cannot get out that's important because you don't want the horse you know the horse is going to stay in there there's not going to be a door but there's going to be fence pieces along the back that keeps the horse from getting out so here's the defense speed not the fence pieces the step piece is going down that way when you move your horse in you can when you um hit shift to get off your horse you jump out the back of it and you don't have to worry about yourself getting stuck so again I'm just covering up the Redstone features put some glass in there um I'm gonna go up on the top and I'm gonna finish putting some slabs to make a roof you know you just want to cover up all the Redstone because the Redstone functionality is still there it's all working it's all done you don't have to mess with it past that point right now you're just trying to make it look good um you know you could get creative with it and you could try to find another way to do this you know you don't have to necessarily do it exactly like my design but um this is one way you know it's a pretty easy way to do this uh if you feel that you could you know take the same concept and apply it to something else you know you very you very well could so yeah here's a here's an overall view of what it looks like at the end the the design of it uh yeah I'm gonna take a horse now and show you what that looks like so you put him in he activates the pressure plate and then you hit shift or whatever your sneak button is and you will jump out the back and that prevents your horse from getting out now the way this works is there's fence gates those fence gates nothing can pass above them so you could even do this with a an invisible door in your house if you want to the same concept because nothing can not even your character can walk over the front shape so I showed there you couldn't even pull them out with the lead but if you went up there and right clicked him you were able to take him out and he um yeah you guys are able to get on your way so thanks for watching guys and as always click in the top right to watch the next video and I will catch you guys later peace"

        "transcript": "hey what's up everyone john of the geek here and I have made a particularly interesting discovery with this MacBook Pro here and that it is fully running Windows 8 release preview on its own completely on its own without any other operating system on here mainly Mac OSX so there before in the past you always had to have Mac OS X installed and you got to run a program called boot camp and then you can run and partition your hard drive so that you can run Windows natively on your MacBook Pro but this particular system is running completely Windows 8 only there is no Mac OS X on here and how I came about to discover this was the hard drive that's in here came from a PC that had Windows 8 installed on there it was just a clean fresh install nothing fancy or anything like that but it just had Windows 8 on there and I plugged it in and I turned it on and I was about to boot up the Snow Leopard installation on here but it got to this screen it just did this and so I waited and I'm like what the heck this is actually going to boot and lo and behold it actually booted now there was a lot of drivers missing and let me log in here real quick and I'll show you what what it's missing or what it was missing right so we're logged in now and as you can see here this is the metro desktop and if I hit the desktop here I'm on the desktop and we'll go to the device manager and I'll show you some of the things that were missing right so there was a lot of drivers missing and I had to painstakingly go through the windows support files here and in boot camp and under drivers apparently the programs when you try to run the boot camp software like you would normally do the setup program here it didn't want to work so I had to painstakingly go through each one of these drivers a 64-bit version and install all of these I don't even know what most of them are and I just installed every single one of them anyways when I did that I got everything working again sound works the wireless works Ethernet the camera works the display drivers I'm running on arrow glass here and that all works just fine and the trackpad is working at first it was working kind of weird the sensitivity on it was a little strange but now it seems to be working just fine and what else umm yeah everything just seems to be working ok and this is pretty interesting to me because I always thought you had had Mac OS X on there now the hard drive on here is a formatted as a Master Boot Record partition and not the GUI D partition like you would normally get on a Mac so it boots Master Boot Record hard drives just fine and I don't know if I can install Windows 8 traditionally like you normally would like just pop this in hold C down and if it will actually boot up that's probably going to be my next venture or for any of you out there want to actually try that and you don't really care about your mac OS x partition you want to wipe it then definitely give that a shot I'm going to go ahead and try it but first I need to install Snow Leopard on there get it working as a fully functioning hard drive with the geo ID partition like you normally have on a Mac then I'm going to try to install Windows 8 on top of there to see if it actually works if not this looks to be pretty pretty darn interesting I'd have to say right so that's pretty much it for this video thanks for watching a comment rate thumbs up thumbs down subscribe if you've got any questions comments concerns leave them in a description and I'll also try to leave this window support driver's disk here just the I guess just the drivers folder in the description as well so that you can download if for those of you who are using boot camp alright thanks for watching I'll catch you later"

        "transcript": "Alice Taylor has been turning the world of toys upside down with Makey lab she's going to tell us why she has such an advantage over the incumbent Makey lab it's very interesting you're at the intersection of games toys and 3D printing and we have one on the table here so my um specialty so some folks say oh you you know you you work for broadcasters but my specialty was always being the nerd inside the building and uh knowing a lot about games I'm a big gamer I've always played games and um always wanted to start games company but what actually happened was uh way back when when with store I built an avatar Builder where you could build your own little character back when people didn't use their own name and they wanted an avatar and it was really really popular and people kind of made all sorts of varieties and in 2010 I was at the toy fair in New York at digital kids actually but at the toy fair and just had that moment where I was like I wonder if you can yet make avatars into dolls using 3D printing or you know cars into cars or dinosaurs into dinosaurs you know why is the digital world and a physical world still so separate um I was curious I didn't know anything about the toy industry went and did a ton of research found out very quickly why they're so very separate um it's all about the difficulty and the long timing of manufacturing uh and then set off to try and bring them together a bit more and there's a very interesting um issue at the center of this which is that injection molding the way that the physical industry has worked for a very long time requires huge volumes of the same thing to be made whereas 3D printing is the complete opposite exactly exactly so it felt like I think a lot of people say it's going to replace traditional manufacturing which is not going to happen or at least if it is it's going to be miles and miles away but what it does is open up a whole completely new area of stuff that you can do so I looked at the traditional thing and and actually back at that toy fair just had this brilliant moment where it was all very clearly explained um because I was sat next to a buyer and an inventor uh the buyer was for Toys R Us and the inventor was this guy and he had a book with a sort of toy stuck to the front of it he was like here's my product you know will you buy it and the Toys are Us person basically explained this is in the States but they said oh yeah sure um as soon as you have 100,000 of those in a warehouse house in the states and the guy was like well I'm just an inventor I can't afford to do that and the Toys R Us person was like that's how we work you go and get it made wherever you're going to get it made you bring it here once it's in the warehouse we look at it and then we decide whether we're going to take that contract and he was like well I just I don't know what to do cuz I can't afford that and so what actually happens is inventors usually pitch big toy companies who then buy that idea from them and do it themselves that's what happens what's the reaction been among well both children and I suppose the industry as well oh wow uh strong so we we thought kids and adults would like to customize toys because a you can see customization being really popular elsewhere but going back to games and avatars people spend hours creating their character and just you know there's a 10-year-old girl I know very well who um just plays World of Warcraft so she can just make character after character after character and so we were expecting it to the basic idea to to fit and it does so we show these to kids and the way it works is there's an app or a a site that you can just use move sliders to change the facial features change the hair the eyes the hands the feet the clothes and you basically build your characters each one is unique and kids will do it for hours you've got a real following among you know the techerati around that round about but what's the breakdown of uh your user base you know how much are the Geeks Who just want to make a doll of themselves and how much are really children definitely still in geek Clans I mean we're still technically in Alpha so we we don't consider ourselves in beta until um the game is out I'll this is the next stage and until the kind of the dolls are really um well one of the things is they're \u00a31 they're just under they're \u00a399 which basically puts it out of the reach of most it's not quite pocket money is it no I mean it's compared at the moment to American Girl in the states which is $109 and the average spent in there is 400 bucks but but it's a very particular slice and that's not great you know we want to get into the hands of everybody but the material costs of 3D printing are still really really high comparatively speaking so that's one of the downsides of it um but anyway all of that said uh when we started when we launched Last Summer with the alpha uh I think we were um 60% male 40% female most in their 30s and 40s so nerds like us basically and then in that year it's now 80% female on the site um we did we've done some questionnaires and of the breakdown now 20% self self um uh say that they're kids 20% say their parents buying for kids and then 60% are still I'm doing it for myself games obviously this this is your uh you know your pet subject so what do you do with with Makey love when you take a doll into that space So at the moment the site in the app is effectively just a doll Builder it's kind of way path and when we started this the whole idea was virtual Goods produce physical goods and so in games you have things like leveling up and rares and epics and all of that kind of stuff you know an item that you have to earn or that you have to find doing some kind of amazing Quest or whatever and we always thought that that would be just brilliant when associated with toys so the when the game comes in it's going to launch in the in the Autumn uh there'll be digital Goods in there physical Goods words there'll be things that you can earn by doing stuff and then we'll grow that over time and so ultimately kids can not only create their character but their character will have stuff that maybe their friends have to then go and do or they have to do something together to earn you know that kind of thing where you really get to go this is my trophy this is what I have done are you worried then about a company like Mattel say coming in and offering a rival service um not really to be honest the more the meria and I think that there's definitely that's going to happen is guaranteed I mean customizable toys are great and everyone will move in for them it's going to be much harder um most of their business is established overseas and it's the system of traditional manufacturer so they'll wait I mean I I actually did some some uh research on this and uh what they like to do is wait for somebody to prove the market and then they come in and probably buy them so they they they tend to move in the kind of buying companies for 400 Grand region rather than doing it themselves I'm thinking Beyond uh this space that you're very early in 3D printing everyone's been talking about it for for quite a long time now but it's still early days and there's huge potential what's exciting you in 3D printing I really feel like 3D printing I feel exactly the same about 3D printing as I did about the web in '95 just like this changes so much um it's a huge field of opportunity it's nerdy and interesting it's rapidly changing so on a kind of daily basis there announcement of here's a new machine here's a new product it is so fascinating it's right at the top of the um hype cycle I talk about this a lot Gartner's hype cycle 3D printing is at the top so everyone's talking about it at the moment and there will be defusion exactly and that will come when people are like I bought my home 3D printer now why can't I print you know chocolate cake on it or whatever and so there'll be a little bit of that but fundamentally I don't think it's a problem because this is only getting better and more varied and more interesting and cheaper on a daily basis so Alice Taylor thank you very much it's been really [Music] interesting"

who's number three etc etc and um fans from all different sides come together pretty much like fight each other on like Twitter Facebook in real life I'm assuming as well to prove their points um we thought that we might contribute and hopefully solve this debate that has been raging on since um since forever I guess um so let me talk about the methodology we used first so success of an actor measures um the films that have become alltime Blockbusters Blockbusters super hits and hits we did not include films that were average performers below average performers even though they could have been profitable we also did not include flops because um a performers below average performers and flops and that's like a debatable list which we did not want to get into so we basically looked at pure and clean successes um these actors had versus the total films and the total films are also unique because we did not include gameo performances um narration um things like performances and like documentaries or short films we did not include that we only included proper films that star these actors in leading roles so let's off start H what am I saying let's start off by talking about um the first person on the list shuk Khan so shuk has had 21 successes which include alltime Blockbusters Blockbusters super hits and hits I'll talk about the list of those films later on but that's pretty much so it's 21 to 49 um total films so that's 42.86% um which sets in at the number one position because of the percentage of success to Total films um the second number goes to Ric rhan who's had a smaller career um 10 years compared to shuk's 20 um but he had had he has had six successes um and the total films he's done is 17 um that pretty much translates to a 35.29% um success rate um followed closely in third place is Amar Khan who has a 3 3.33% success rate from 12 films and number four is obviously another Khan Salan Khan with a 26. 56% success rate um and we go down on the list we pretty much see Akay Kumar at 15% roughly Sunny deol roughly like 133% and AJ dun at roughly 11% a little less than that but roughly 11% um so now that now we established the position of these actors in the industry let me talk about the films that we used to determine this so as you know shuk had 21 films out of 49 total films um and the alltime Blockbusters were films like while Blockbusters were like Kar Arjun k3g CH India om shantiom etc etc so we pretty much went through each and every actor on the list and told you guys what these FMS were and how we reached these rankings so as you can see we have shuk Khan Salman Khan and when you're watching the video feel free to pause it anytime to look at these um names and read them carefully next we have Akay Kumar Aman and you might be wondering why a a time Blockbuster is missing from Akay Kumar that's because um he actually hasn't had any alltime Blockbusters um we use box office India for this data so um that's the I guess body we're sticking to and Amar Khan has actually had all alltime Blockbusters but no simple Blockbusters so it's kind of um the opposite so moving on to our last page um we see that there's Sunny de AJ Dave gun and Ric Ro and again AJ dun also has not had an alltime Blockbuster um and the same applies to Ric ran who hasn't had an all-time Blockbuster so when you look at that data um that were provided it's pretty clear that shok Khan is definitely the number one star followed by R the Gran and amarc con based on rate of success let me make that absolutely clear um I would also like to give a shout out to um SAA Maya Who provided the data and Analysis for this I'm pretty much just doing the voice over and giving you guys information um another thing I would like to say is if you look in the description down below you'll see that there's two links um the two links basically take you to um the data the list provided by saam Maya and you can look at our exact methodology pretty much like have like a copy a list form of the information provided here and you can also look at the films we excluded um due to Cameo appearances for example um Sho Khan um had a few films that he did a cameo appearance in like dla Mila R Gran as well um he's had a few Cameo appearances Amar Khan has also had a couple Cameo appearances San Khan also has a lot of Camu appearances like um I think his recent one was Tella um S and A D actually have not had that many gam appearances um if you look at it it's only been like maybe three or four so um that isn't really caus her much concern but all these other actors including Akay Kumar have had a lot of Cameo appearances and you can access that list by clicking the link in the description so hopefully this has been an informative video about who is the top dog quote unquote in Bollywood and we'll look forward to seeing you in the next video"

        "transcript": "hi guys it's Victoria and this is going to be a video on kick up needles and everyone's been asking me to do this for a very long time I've just been busy doing other stuff and so yeah it's going to be a video on kick up needles and in this video I'm going to do beginner hiccup needles and advanced kick up needles and a little bit of like stretches to get a kick at you okay so yeah where you do any kick ups or any scorpions or needles of any kind make sure that you have stretched and warmed up your muscles and by warm up I don't mean just like start stretching I mean jumping jacks or some sort of warm out warm up you do before you practice and stuff so if you do a kick up needle you have to have like a pretty good scorpion or a good needle and make sure you don't have like a Dorito or anything like that because if you do you can't really kick it up because your back has to be really flexible so this is a beginner needle and kick up needle and it's where you don't have enough momentum to like just kick it back straight which means like you have to go like this and then kick it up and that's what people who don't have enough flexibility in their back have to do because they can't kick it up with just standing here as their back isn't flexible enough so this is a kick up like a beginner kick it up another thing that I've seen people do that looks really helpful and they've told me that they like this way and it's where you take your foot forward like actually kick your foot like hard so you get enough momentum to grab it from the back and if you're just starting out I'll recommend this for you so this is what it looks like okay and I'll do it one more time and when you're doing a kick up needle it's this isn't okay some people grab their for their scorpions and stuff like this and then bring it over and that's not good at all like it can mess up your back in your shoulders and plus it just good so if you're one of those people trying to change it I know it's hard but just try to change it the best you can the more you practice for it the more it will help you it'll pay off so when you do a kick up don't like go bring it like that just make sure to have your back Center and like your hips in line in your shoulders in line in the back the top of the video is going to be advance kick of needles and this is the needle kind of kick up needle that I prefer and that I think I'm best at and my back is responsible enough for me to not have to swing and that's what the advance kick up needle is it's where you don't have to swing forward on like farther than your ankle you just keep it like this and then you just kick back and that's an advanced needle and that's the kind that I use typically so this is what an advanced needle kick up needle looks like and usually hold it for 10 or 20 seconds because I usually do that but I can't video and it's going to be like way too long but this is another thing this is another advanced trick of you know and when you're doing an advance kick of neo you can once you grab it and pull up then you can change your grip how you want it because usually when you do a kick of needle you grab your ankle then pull up and then if you don't really like that and it's not advanced enough for you then you can just um find a new grip that you like like if you have if your grip is like this then when you do a kick up needle in here all the way up you can just move that long it's really easy this is just for fun and it a really super duper advanced ok good needle that you can do and it's one that I've really never seen before I just kind of made it up because I stretch every night or at least I try to sometimes I have days where I just take a break because I need a break like mentally and physically because if I quote a muscle or something I don't know but anyways so you this is like a really advanced one and I kind of just experimented one day and I was like hey I can do this so it's a one arm pickup needle and it's actually very hard and I've trouble with it sometimes so this is it and don't kick it up with this arm because this arm isn't even a needle it's not even doing anything it's just kind of like a scale if you pick it up so um this arm is basically just like there so you kind of have to make up something what to do with your hand so it doesn't look like really awkward like imagine just like and you do it like this but anyways so you can do like cheetahs or you can do Top Gun or California stars or something like that so this is the one arm pickup you so like I said and the last cut thing is the ice cream night with my stretches a lot because if I do something for a long period of time and I usually feel like it's not stretching me anymore then I do something that's really like awesome that I'm really proud of and that I kind of experiment with things and make things up as I go along so this is one of the things that I kind of made up I don't know like it was probably already a thing because it's kind of like basic but it's really hard and not a lot of people do it and it's called a straight leg kick up needle and it's where you don't bend your leg and the kick up at all it's just straight like that the whole time and so this is a straight leg Chicago I'll do it again thank you guys so much for watching this video I hope you liked it and thank you for also watching my past videos and I'll start making more videos more because I haven't made one in a long time and this is the first time back really so I hope you guys like this video and if you did thumbs up and comment for any more requests and thank you for all the nice feedback on my kik and Instagram and messages and comments so yeah thank you thanks for watching"

        "transcript": "So once we get in there you guys are going\nto climb off your horses here in a few moments when I tell you to, we're going to ride through\nall of these guests, we're going to ride down the road, and I'm going to stop at each campsite\nand give you guys, I'll call out your name and you guys will be able to camp in those\ncampsites down there. Well, the program is with the Boy Scouts. It's a Boy Scout program,\nand it's, one of the neatest things about this program is that we're not just out here\non a horseback ride going around in a little circle and then back to the same place. We're\nmoving the herd. We have of about 70 to 80 head of horses, which, there are about 50\nout here with us right now. We're moving them between our two camps. We have a winter camp\nranch. The ranch itself is outside Scott's Mills and we have a mountain camp that's on\nthe backside of Mt. Hood not too far outside of Dufur. And we run these horses up there\nall summer as a scout program. We're with us 9 days. We start with many kids who have\nnever been on a horse before. This trip here we have 36 folk on. And there's a number of\nthem who have never rode before. We start with an orientation day on the first Saturday.\nIt starts at 11:00 and it goes until dark. And then the next morning we wake them up\nat, before light, feed them before light, and we're down at the corals as the sun's\nrising. And my 8:30 or 9:00 we're on our horse heading toward our first campsite. The Boy\nScouts of America have a long tradition of stewardship across the landscape and here\non the Mt. Hood. My big hope with the Boy Scouts of America is that they will form the\nnew stewards of our country and will work within Public Service towards trying to promote\nland management across the landscape and all of our public lands. You know it's something\nthat has changed over the years. Years ago this was a trip to get our horses moved. But,\nI don't know if it was just because I wanted these kids to experience more or if I was\njust bored with just riding or whatever, but we've really transformed this thing into,\na 9 day horsemanship clinic that we talk continually about humanship skills. We have a whole session\non leadership, a whole session on goal setting, a whole session on having a positive attitude\nand how that attitude can transform your life. I'm learning about horsemanship, and how to\nbe successful, and how to just be a better person in life and to see what acting like\na Western cowboy can teach you. I have also grown in, kind of just faith in myself and\nalso relying on others and an animal that I'm riding on trusting my life with and it's\na great partnership between you and the horse and I think I'm having a great partnership\nwith Oreo. She's a great horse. She is an Appaloosa I think. She 16 years old. She's\nslow, but she get's the job done. It's a trust thing, she trusts me, I trust her. It works.\nI've only fallen off once. It wasn't that bad, so I think we're doing pretty well. The\nvery first day, we start talking to these, to everybody because there are adults on this\ntrip too, about the difference between human time--the time we all run out in the city\nand when we've got a job and responsibilities and all that. But then the other thing is\nhorse time. And that horse time that we teach these kids about is the time that slows down\nto the pace of the horse. And whatever happens happens and however much time it take it takes.\nThere are a lot of different sayings these kinds of kids, these kids start picking up\non. Like if you take the time it takes, it takes less time. Make the right thing easy\nand the wrong thing difficult. Recognize the smallest change. Reward the slightest try.\nAnd they start looking at those little things with their horse and then they start realizing\nhow important that is with their lives. The youth that are involved in this program, are\nvery interested in protecting the resources of the Mt. Hood National Forest and use them\nin a way where they can be sustained over a long period of time. Boy Scouts in general\nare people who have a high ethic related to land use and land protection and I view them\nas the future stewards of our public lands across the United States. It's an amazing\nprogram. I wish every kid in the country could go on it because it's one of the things that\npeople don't realize their kids need. They need responsibility, they need boundaries,\nthey need to know what they can do and what they can't do. They need to have people tell\nthem they are great and they need to be successful. And that's all something that happens to every\nkid who comes out here. They just long for this. It's just what their hearts' desire\nis but they just don't know it because we don't do this in the world anymore. And so\nit's great. I tell these kids when they get here, it's a trip of a lifetime. It's going\nto transform your like just get ready to have your life changed. And I don't let them down.\nThey know that and they come back and tell me that and they come time after time to get\nmore of that."

        "transcript": "hello and thanks for joining us today my name is mark mathis and i'm the president of houseplane gallery and today we're going to be taking you through a short walk-through of one of our best-selling southern style house plans hpg-1751 the cedarbrook now this home has a 1751 square foot layout with three bedrooms and two baths and has a slab crawl space and basement foundation options now many of you have probably already seen this particular home featured in various magazines and plan books and one reason that has become so popular is due to its attractive traditional country style exterior and its very efficient floor plan layout now as we look at the front of the home you'll notice your two-car garage over here on the left and a large inviting front porch right here again keep in mind that this home has been designed in a more traditional southern style but if you prefer to have a different architectural style or exterior on this home we can certainly take care of that for you through a fairly simple plan modification now as we look at the floor plan of this home you'll notice that there's an absolute minimum of wasted space in this home design and we've tried to squeeze every usable square foot without sacrificing the floor plan's flow and livability now the first thing that you'll notice on this home is that you have a nice covered porch both on the front and rear of the house which provides you with a couple of nice areas to visit and play with your family out of the elements as we enter the great room you'll notice that it's quite large for a home of this size and includes a trade ceiling throughout with a gas log fireplace on the right side of the room along with a location for built-in shelving and entertainment center as a quick side note many of our clients are utilizing this space above the gas-like fireplace to locate their tvs dvd players audio equipment etc and it really provides even more usable space in the great room as we go into the kitchen you'll notice the large island with raised eating bar and on the right side is the eating area which has plenty of room for your growing family and also includes easy access onto the rear covered porch area now if you would prefer a less open layout in this area it's just a matter of adding two partial walls here and here to give you a more separated kitchen and living area just let us know if that's something that you're interested in and we can take care of that for you next we'll go into the right side of the home which includes two large 12x12 bedrooms and a shared bath you'll also notice the sound deadening hallway with both a broom closet and a linen closet to give you plenty of storage room now as we walk back across the house you'll notice the storage closet right here and the large media hobby room that can be used for whatever need you have at a given time from a home office to a computer room to a storage area to a kid's playroom across the hall will go into the large master bedroom suite which features a vaulted ceiling and easy access into the spacious master bath which includes large his and her walk-in closets in the master bath you'll notice that we have dual sinks with a separate vanity area plenty of storage area a garden tub and a separate shower on this closet area right here what many people are requesting is to have this wall removed and made into one large walk-in closet that has easy access from both the master bathroom and the master bedroom now as we go back out into the entry hallway you'll see that we've included a sizeable utility room which is always so important to have with enough space to locate another refrigerator freezer you also have an indoor storage area over here with easy access into the oversized garage and right here we're just showing where the stairs would be located if you chose a basement foundation here i just wanted to show you a few images of what the interior of the home would look like built out as you can see the view over here on the left is a rear eating area into the great room and this view on the right is looking from the great room into the kitchen area now as we look at the rear of the home again keep in mind that this has been drawn in a traditional southern architectural style and we can modify this to fit any personal preferences or neighborhood covenants that you might have about exterior materials to be used architectural details etc on that same point remember that if you find any plan that you like but there are a few items that you'd like to have changed on the floor plan or exterior just give us a call at you through all the 601-264-5028 modifications you need and then we'll update the plans to fit those needs our in-house team of designers can modify any plan that you find on houseplantgallery.com and we'll be glad to help you with any questions that you might have to view this home online simply visit us at www.houseplan gallery dot com forward slash hpg-1751 and you'll be able to see all the additional home information and images that we simply couldn't fit into this brief walk through again the hpg-1751-1 is an excellent family home design that will provide you with a very livable floor plan layout that i think you'll be quite happy with be sure to give us a call at 601-264-5028 with any questions that you have and we'll be glad to help again have a great day and best wishes in the building of your new home you"

        "transcript": "hi guys welcome back to Men tour and yet another video podcast I hope you're all doing great um I'm just doing my barbecue here for the evening um I realized that I actually promise you guys that um I was going to talk a little bit about crosswind takeoffs and I didn't do that on my takeoff Roll video so I'm going to do that now in a second if you just give me a second put my meat on the grill I'll be with you in just a moment this is important stuff you know you don't want to screw this up so I hope you guys are enjoying the video so far I'm doing my best to try to answer everyone's questions and if you feel that you need anything else explain or anything that you want me to include then please let me know uh send in as always a query directly to my YouTube page or to my Facebook page that I have now Mentor pilot or um or Instagram or whatever and also another thing that I'd like you to do is share if you like the videos that I'm doing please feel free to share them on Facebook for example CU that way it will spread much quicker and that will grow the channel and there will be more content coming on so it would be great if you could do that and uh I will continue to try to do my best and and do more videos of whatever kind that you like me to do there we go so so cross win takeoffs right um the takeoff roll will be started in next exactly the same way as I explained on my previous video um the P monitoring pet flying part is exactly the same however with Crosswinds you have a couple of things that you need to think about for once it's the rolling takeoff that I that we were discussing in the beginning of my previous video so you want to make sure that you do get a rolling take off because you uh you want to make sure to to get as little risk of a compressor stall as possible you get that by having the a of moving as you set to take of trust so you line it up on the runway and you set take of trust while the aircraft is still moving that's one thing the other thing uh that's going to be a bit of a complication during the actual take off roll is as you're moving down the runway of course the wind will be coming and pushing on this huge R here so what happens then is that the aircraft tends to weathercock in towards the wind so it will turn towards the direction of the wind and you need to counteract that with r so as the wind is pushing R you'll contact it with your R pedals and you're moving down but as we were talking about before you also need to put a little bit of Aon into the wind not too much if you put in more than one and a half uh units on your Yol it'll mean that the flight spoilers is going to start ra new Wings which will then create more drag and that will increase the takeoff roll distance and also decrease your um tail clearance which is something you definitely want to try to avoid so at the moment then you're putting a little bit of if the wind is coming from this direction you'll putting a bit of left brother in in order to maintain the center line and you'll also put a little bit of right Aon in to make sure that the aircraft doesn't flip over with the wind okay but only as much uh Alon as you need in order to keep the uh Wings level as you're going down this means that as you get into the rotation you will actually have cross control so you'll have a little bit of left run a little bit of right a r on in now this will in itself cause a bit of u a bit of extra drag which means that your tail clearance will be slightly less your margins will be slightly less which is makes it even more important that your rotation rate is those 2 de per second now what tends to happen is that people sitting with this they're having a little bit of trouble maintaining the center line and they want to get away from the ground as quickly as possible to get out of this cross control sit situation so what what actually tends to happen is that people volage much quicker with crosswing now you have to be very careful that you have to make sure that you don't do that because with the cross controls in if you suddenly jerk the aircraft of the runway since you have maybe a little bit of spoiler deflection and you are going to have to put a bit more Aon into the wind as you rotate because that's when the aircraft is going to feel the full force of the crosswing it's highly likely that or it's actually more likely that you will tail strike so the crosswind takeoffs is something that we practice quite a lot um it requires a lot of practice in order to get really uh confident with it and um like I said the what we tend to do is if the Crosswinds goes over 15 knots more or less at least in my Airline we tend to let the captain do it but but of course post officers do need to practice this as well so we try to uh to get everyone to do it a little bit of you know harder crosswind during the line training so that they get a chance to to get the feeling of it but in essence when you come from procedures and so on the procedures are exactly the same you just have to be aware that these extra complications are in there when you're dealing with crosss um cross Landings is a completely different thing which I'll do a completely full podcast about but I just wanted to make this one to um to fill in a little bit of extra information about the crosswind part of take of roll that I didn't cover in My Last Broadcast okay so once again I hope you guys enjoy are enjoying this and um feel free to send in more questions and more suggestions keep them coming and share this video on uh Facebook and Instagram whatever you feel like so that um the channel can continue to grow for now I'm going to continue to um fix my barbecue for uh the Sunday meet meet for my U family and I hope you all have a fantastic evening and take care I'll see you next time"

that's a fact and that needs to be on the tip of everyone's tongue this man was robbed from us his life was robbed his family was robbed and I say not only is it mental illness that did that it's the stigma of mental illness that really put put that all the way but I've noticed is that people feel more secure saying they went to rehab then saying that I need mental assistance right yes you don't go into a some sort of treatment program presumably hospital or at least a program that is meant for the treatment of addiction to maintain recovery now he might have got to do a hospital for depression that was threatening his recovery but why can't we talk about that why can't we be more direct some of the term rehab covers everything from sober living to psychiatric hospitalization you don't necessarily have to go out and start drinking and using again to sort of fall off the wagon it's all up here the slip occurs long before the first drink or the first drug if you're not working your program of sobriety in recovery people are going to want him to be Robin Williams as opposed to Robin Williams the person you either choose to live your recovery out louder you choose to hide it in the closet and if you choose to hide it in the closet not only are you doing a disservice to other people who need recovery but you're doing a disservice to living your own truth and living out loud I'm an addict I'm an alcoholic I'm clean and sober and I'm proud of it what happens when you're that depressed is actually it is a selfish disorder because you become so entrenched in your own one day Judy I'm gonna say this I'm not let you get away with that cuz i'm going to say you I did I challenge anybody to have an extreme pain of any type whether it's emotional or it's you're limping cut off whatever it is try not to be selfish when you're in overwhelming pain it's you don't you can't see past your body boundary because that's the way our central nervous system works cuz i love this euphemism that's flying around though he battled inner demons I know demons guys or what people talked about people suffering from when they had brain disorders in the Middle Ages demons these are brain disease is why don't we talk about demons but somebody has a heart attack we could we used to 300 years ago why don't we just call those demons when somebody's fighting a heart disease in fact is brain disorders are precisely the same I'm no near as funny as talented as this man but I definitely live in them in the same world as him and being up and down and having addiction problems myself it's sad that he's gone and it's it's really scaring me right now because I feel like I have too much in common with this person I would use a word that I don't often use as it pertains to public figures but he's somebody I think everybody loved there he either had an act or played some character was in some movie that everybody is attached to in some way he watched out for me in the days with early you know in the 70s when both of us were just sort of baby addicts running around los angeles long before we even knew what sober meant i was like 11 years old and my mom would pretty much have the different comedians come over to the house and Robin was there and basically they were they were getting high we went on in 2003 right when they caught Saddam Hussein and he was able to come up with these jokes like right off the tip of his tongue to 10,000 people in a hangar that haven't seen home that war just started and he would just bring this light and everyone was laughing you were dying on stage he always wanted to keep that energy level in the room hi it was like a psychological imperative for him you know like he would feel that that if the energy dropped and he wasn't being funny he was somehow disappointing you talk about is there a link between depression and comedian first of all I want to say that comedy is not something that you go into if you're well-adjusted okay it's not something that's just like oh I want it so lifeline it's a last resort I piece for me and I believe a lot of comedians are like that comedy is it's a very lonely um it's a lonely existence I mean you know you're on stage with just you in the audience and you know you you get you get the love you know from them and you feed off of it the drug is just going out onstage and feeling that connection with people because you get to be so close with those people but yet you're so not close with them because the second you leave that stage they're out of your life the problem with comics like that and and myself included is when we're at our darkest sometimes that's when we're the funniest to other people so it's almost counterintuitive whether it's stage or drugs or people or the audience's the fixes feel good at the moment and leave you empty on the other side or craving more and unable to fill that void he tried to make it into the UFC and he didn't quite cut it and I had a he had a you know how people these days if you're not the best fighter then you need to market yourself with other abilities and he seemed to be an a-hole you were not a real man real men do not beat up their girlfriends and then as Julian just said run and hide from the consequences like a coward and I hope to god that he does get caught violence and aggression is this guy's only form of communication with people and not only did he beat up his ex-girlfriend he tortured her which Sam described the other day so well I mean poked her with knives cut off her hair made her shower this guy is sick she's broken she's having even more problems because of the way people are treating her on social media they're they're building him up and saying that she deserves it because she was a war on star it was self-defense when you took a dull knife and cut her hair off it's a laughable defense this is the kind of guy who comes into my office and says it wasn't kidnapping it was a surprise adoption"

        "transcript": "[Music] hey guys my name is matimo and today I'm playing some crisis 2 demo and uh today I'm actually going to bring you some sniper gameplay because I find that there's not a lot of sniper action or sniper gameplay on YouTube for crisis 2 so I figured I'd bring it to you guys um but really in this game I want to talk about kind of sniping and some maybe some things I'd like to see changed in the game or maybe just polished a little bit uh because I really have enjoyed this game so far at least the demo and you know I just you know feel like some of these things would make it a little bit more enjoyable and would just kind of fine-tune it uh yeah so I hope you guys enjoy so sniping this game is definitely very fun but it's also very difficult and in case you're wondering it is a one shot one kill to the Head um but if you go for a body shot it's going to take two shots but so far there's we've only had one sniper rifle um so there might be more powerful sniper rifles in the main game I'm not sure I'd actually be kind of surprised by this because I don't think they wanted quick scoping in this game at least by the mechanics I've seen so far I could be completely wrong uh but there's some things that are are kind of kind of different for me I guess they're not completely different but the hit detection in this game is very precise so if you're going to go for a head shot it's it's got to like you got to hit his head there is no little you know hit marker box or anything around his uh his body so if you want to get that head shot you're going to have to really hit him in the in the face basically and most games do have a little leeway in this department but I have noticed that it's a little unforgiving at times where you think you actually got the head shot but if you like look at your gameplay later it's like yeah I was a couple you know a couple inches away from his face uh which is not a problem I think that will just make it so that sniping requires a little bit more skill uh than other games and I do not have a problem with that uh it's just something that I'm going to have to get used to uh but overall I would say that the most important thing about sniping in this game is to actually stay patient uh there are some times where you're going to see that I'm just firing off shots where I'm not hitting anything and it would have served me better if I actually just kind of took my time and waited for the enemy to settle down and uh took the shot then and then there there's also going to be some examples in here where the enemy is shooting me I don't I don't rush it and I just kind of uh take my time and then I'm able to get the head shot and if I actually didn't do that I wouldn't have gotten the kill uh but if you're going against a sniper wow I'm talking fast guys but I I have a lot of stuff I want to talk about um but if you're going against a sniper the best thing to do is to not Crouch like that guy and also to move around as much as possible because uh they're going to have to go for a head shot and if you're moving around especially with the Nano suit uh you know you can move pretty quickly and it's going to be very difficult for them to actually take you out so uh and also you know what you want to close the gap on them as well um so that's it for the snipers uh I did want to talk about really quickly some some stuff I would like to see Polished in the game and the first thing because I play on PC is I'd like to have multiple keybinds to where you can keybind uh let's say Crouch to do different Keys uh the reason I say this is because Crouch is a great uh I have a great key for Crouch right now but if you want to do the power slide uh you have to both Sprint and then hit the Crouch button at the same time and uh my fingers aren't that Nimble I guess and for whatever reason hitting the sprint button and Crouch at the same time just doesn't work uh so B basically I just want to have a key or uh a a way to make it so that two different key binds can do the same thing and I think that would just make it a little bit more enjoyable uh another thing that I would like to see change is maybe the sensitivity for jumping uh I find that a lot of times when I go for a normal jump I actually go for the super jump and this can get annoying especially if you're running out of energy and you need to have the energy for for armor mode and uh it's definitely got me killed a couple of times and also there's been some times where I will go for or uh normal jump and then I'll super jump into or off the building it's pretty frustrating when it happens it doesn't happen very often but I just think that if they maybe lowered the sensitivity for super jump uh it would just make it a little less frustrating at times um but that's just my opinion now another thing that I think I would like to see changed is when you pick up a dog tag after you've killed someone I would like it so that you would cons continuously see how many uh how many tags you actually have accumulated uh because right now they disappear really quickly and I find that for the most part I will actually forget how many dog tags I actually have and there's been definitely been some cases where I think I have I only need one more to actually get my next kill streak and I will you know rush to go get it and then I'll get myself killed because of it and while this isn't really a bad thing and I just think that if they made it or made an option so that you could continuously see the dog tags or how many you had at all times uh I think it would just be a little bit more enjoyable and make uh the US interface maybe a little bit more a little bit more friendly um and less I don't know you guys maybe I'm just completely stupid and I just need to be need to remember how many actually have uh but yeah another thing is the melee system can be a little wonky I find that there's sometimes where I think I've won the melee battle but all of a sudden he just takes me out and I don't know I it's definitely definitely a very interesting system I'm not really sure how they could improve upon it uh but I just kind of wanted to get your guys' opinion what do you guys think about the melee system I find it's it's kind of strange uh it's it's definitely interesting but let me know down in the comment section and lastly I figured I should just mention this really quickly you guys probably noticed that I haven't used the Nano suit Vision or the Nano Vision at all uh throughout this entire gameplay well that's because this is a little bit older and I I just never really got into using it it I didn't keybind it to a more appropriate uh position and I just I just never used it and a lot of people criticized me on my last video video for not using it but I I I'm still I'm still getting used to the game like everyone else and I figured I should just mention it so don't think I'm a complete idiot but I am I kind of am so uh my team lost which was a little unfortunate but I felt like it was a fun game and kind of gave you guys a good a good uh picture of what it is to be a sniper uh but this about wraps it up guys if you enjoyed the video please make sure to rate it and also if you'd like to see more videos from me definitely make sure to check out my channel but until next time guys have a good one and take it easy hey guys now have our own website actually we've always had our own website but why not follow us on there there you'll find all our

        "transcript": "for really cheap games i urge you guys to go check out g2a.com the links are in the description okay hey guys what is going on my name is altizonda and this right here is the c50cpx headset from thrustmaster and basically i've never actually reviewed a headset from frostmaster before so i'm actually really excited to basically see what they offer until they bring the table now this is a universal gaming headset designed for the ps3 the xb360 pc and mac and it also is compatible with playstation 4. uh obviously we'll be compatible with the xbox one as well providing you have a chat adapter but that is all you'll need hopefully should be anyway if it works with the basement 360 it'll work with the xbox one providing you have a chat adapter um yeah um firstly there's a little frequency response bit there which shows you about the base the medium and the highs which is actually pretty cool as long as it's kind of interesting to learn little facts about that uh it's basically the actual it has an independent controller like a little unit uh where basically you can change the game volume and the voice volume is fully adjustable for big heads and small heads in case you've got a big head like mine it has a uh yeah it has a 5.2 meter cable it has a 50 minus 50 decibels microphone sensitivity apparently it's a 32 ohms and it's a has a patch it has a detachable and adjustable microphone which is always cool obviously has the chat cable for the xbox 360. it has strong passive isolations basically when you're in game you can't really hear anything about it it's very uh sound immersive so to speak and it's also tailored design for the ultimate comfort and it also works with handheld devices as well which is pretty cool so instead of me reading you the boring details off the box let's just get on the head and open it let's see what we get inside so first of all we have some instructions nobody reads those but we want to see what's actually in the box and actually open the upside down which probably wasn't really the best of like this so let's get rid of this there we go wow first thing first of all the first thing you notice is it's very very big and chunky i like that i like that a lot um so obviously we get the uh normal cables in there for this game sound we have obviously a massive massive long usb cable just there and we actually also have we have more instructions like i said nobody reads the instructions god damn it um see how we have obviously your audio cables you have here you have your chat chat lead there for ux 360. so we'll see that plugs in there like so uh so let's get this beautiful big ass headset out this disgusting horrible plasticky nightmare of a wrapping not a fan of this plasticky wrap stuff it's really i don't know why just always annoys me but wow straight away i'm liking that already guys i am liking that already let's get out of this get the microphone out which way it's going to come out there we go i'm going to take off this little little bag there there we go we got rid of all the horrible plasticky bag wrap stuff so first of all this is the headset guys and the first thing i'm going to say is it actually looks really really nice and i like this kind of weird design they've got going on the side there um because it's very very nice plushie it comes to a levery type uh i think it may be a level or maybe a kind of other type of fabric that feels very very nice obviously uh fully extendable i do believe there we go there we go there we go now it does tilt on there like that to be a comfy fit has a very very big plush headband bit just there which is very very nice every night overall it looks pretty damn cool and the microphone should just slip in there like so and there you go pops in and there's your microphone in there as well obviously we've got this massive massive chat cable there is the uh there's a little command unit so obviously you've got your mic on there you've got your mic game you've got chat you've got game you've got bass as well which is pretty cool you got microphone mute and that and your voice mute as well which is pretty damn sweet and yeah overall this thing's looking pretty damn sweet i'm liking this a lot i am liking this a lot of people this looks very very nice indeed very very nice i like it i like it like it like it like i like the big microphone it's obviously flexible around that bit there which is pretty cool i'll see that but there's not but that's pretty nice i like i like that that's quite cool um but yeah overall this looks like a really nice bit of kit frost master i am impressed my friends i am impressed so i want to say massive massive thank you so far for freshmaster for sending me this app for review first of all and also must be funky for you guys who have tuned in to watch the video today big big thank you for that and uh yeah stay tuned for the final review of the uh frost master was it c250 cx is the 250

        "transcript": "Welcome to the World of Warcraft Patch 5.4 preview. Today we\u2019ll be taking a look at several\nof the biggest new features coming in Patch 5.4: Siege of Orgrimmar. First up, the Timeless Isle; a place of great cultural\nsignificance to the Pandaren, the Timeless Isle exists\noutside of the normal passage of time. Every so often it reappears, and in Patch 5.4 it\u2019s reappearing\njust off the coast of the Jade Forest. Content on the Timeless Isle\nis based entirely on exploration. As you make your way\naround the island, you\u2019ll discover rare creatures, hidden treasure chests, special events,\npuzzles, and all sorts of other surprises. And you\u2019ll be rewarded\nfor your efforts with gear\nup to item level 535, account-bound tokens that you can use\nto gear up your alts, battle pets, Lesser Charms of Good Fortune, and a variety of other fun items. Of course, one of the biggest\nnew features in 5.4 is the Siege of Orgrimmar raid. The forces of the Alliance fleet\nand the Horde rebellion are bearing down on Orgrimmar\nwith one goal: remove Garrosh Hellscream from power. This is a huge instance\nwith 14 total bosses, starting in the now destroyed\nVale of Eternal Blossoms, leading to an assault\non the gates of Orgrimmar itself, and finally to a massive\nunderground base located beneath Ragefire Chasm. Along with the new raid comes a brand new difficulty mode. Flexible mode fits in between Raid Finder\nand Normal in terms of difficulty, and is targeted at\nthe friends and family group that just wants to have\nsome fun together, without the stress\nand extra pressure that Normal or Heroic raiding provides. In Flexible mode, you can bring\nany number of players you like\nfrom 10 to 25 and the instance will scale itself\naccordingly to match your group. Look to our preview\non the World of Warcraft website for more details\non this exciting new feature. If you\u2019re not quite ready\nto step up into group content, or you\u2019d like to try out\nanother spec or role, or even if you\u2019d just like\nto get some practice in, then you might want\nto check out Proving Grounds. These are solo instances\nspecifically designed to test your abilities\nas a tank, healer, or damage dealer. They\u2019re a great way\nto get some experience under your belt without having to worry\nabout the stress of letting your group down. Once you\u2019ve worked your way through Bronze, Silver, and Gold ratings, you may even want\nto give Endless mode a try. See how long you can last. Patch 5.4 also features the conclusion of Mists of Pandaria\u2019s\nlegendary quest chain. Players who have completed\nthe previous steps of the chain will be sent to meet\nwith Wrathion on the Timeless Isle, where he\u2019ll send you\non a series of short tasks, including defeating\nthe four Celestials in combat before upgrading your previous\nepic cloak to legendary status. Completing this quest\nwill also give you access to Ordos, a challenging world boss\nlocated on the Timeless Isle. Of course, these are just a few\nof the new changes and features coming in Patch 5.4. Be sure to check out\nour official patch preview on the World of Warcraft website\nfor more information. Thanks for watching,\nand we\u2019ll see you in Orgrimmar."

        "transcript": "[Music] hey everybody its marissa again thanks for coming back to see me this is weak 54 gonna give you a little recap of how my last week went um I'm my apologies for this late update i realized today it was friday night so I hadn't done my videos so i definitely like to stay consistent with things and this helps me and I definitely had to make the time today to get this done um so thanks for stopping by last week was challenging it seems like I'm always having these challenges but that's life that's what life is different curveballs and that so I was out and about a lot of socializing I went to three concerts last week lots of fun um but definitely it brings up a lot of you know potential for falling off the track you know if you're not ready for it so I did my best I had my little handy dandy survival kit you know um bring my milk in my water for after afterward you know when I know I'm gonna be hungry um that definitely helped to prepare I find that planning ahead as much as I can you know definitely um it definitely you know comes in handy so I'll do a little recap I had my gastric bypass ruined white surgery on September 13 2010 and as of Monday September 26 2011 I'm down 160 7.4 pounds which means I stayed the same um I was pleased with that because I was definitely feeling as if I gained um I definitely didn't feel like I had lost and I definitely got on the scale off and on like six times just to see if it would budge and it stayed exactly the same so I'm happy with that I'll take it I'm hoping for a little bit of a loss this week but we'll see I you know I just do what I do and I hope for the best and i'm just still staying consistent with the plan and everything and that's that um i have not addressed hair loss in quite some time and i know i talked about it briefly in a million videos ago but definitely it's still an issue that's in the forefront for me and i do want to talk about that a little bit um I did not start experiencing hair loss to about seven months out I really had thought for a while that I had to dodge that bullet and I wasn't gonna have any issues with it and I was like yeah I'm not gonna have any hair loss then all of a sudden it was pretty much night and day all of us in I was you know she and putting my hair and it was just coming out in gobs like disturbing amounts of hair just handfuls of hair um so yeah I definitely got a rude awakening um so it don't think is very typical to get hair loss that far out of surgery but that's how it's worked for me um ever since that point I started doing taking biotin supplements every day and I also started using nioxin I brought by little Max and scalp treatment to show everybody if you want to see the label this is a level 3 this is normal too thin looking hair for chemically treated hair because I do color my hair along with the scalp treatment I also use the cleanser and a scalp therapy I shampoo and I leave it on until it starts tingling that's what they recommend the same with the scalp therapy which is a conditioner and then the scalp treatment follows you put this on damp hair tells right hair directly into the scalp comb through and then a style as usual I do like three different products and I blow dry um the way I've kind of dealt with the hair loss is I've kind of roll with the punches with it getting my hair cut short has definitely helped with the volume I feel like it's definitely made it feel a lot fuller plus I know I am kind of turning the corner on the whole hair loss um thing because I have a lot of new growth a lot of fuzziness ever its kind of filling in it's just taking time and it's just something that kind of comes with this whole procedure it's a side effect of surgery you know when I talked to my surgeon I was going to see if I any deficiencies in the protein that I could probably say well that's why my hair is getting thin but everything's okay and the way she explained it is that you know when you get the surgery done you don't absorb as much nutrients from food and with all the supplements you take those all go to your vital organs first you know and then it's pretty much the hair in the nail they come last and they're the ones that suffer so I know a lot of people are attached to their hair I think I kind of used my hair is like a little like I used to hide under my hair that's why I always kept it long I always thought I could never have short hair but things you know change and my feeling towards it i just felt like I didn't have a use for it anymore and I definitely wanted something different so that works for me and just with the fact that my hair has been shutting um it's helped just to you know get the cut helps me feel like it's a little bit fuller um and that's that if anybody has any other suggestions anything it's worked for them like I said just to recap i'm doing the biotin every day and i'm also doing that I accent every day like I I stayed very consistent with that I have used I had used my accent about 10 years ago I had some thinning due to stress in a medical condition and I used it consistently in a came back and I'm very pleased to say that it's working again so um I think consistency is key with that um so yeah I'm still shedding not as bad as I was it's not disturbing anymore I mean it was really bad um absol you know I have to i've made my bangs thicker like I've done my work here to kind of camouflage things a little bit but um you know I just have to be patient for it to kind of fill in a little bit more so I give you patient I'm cool with that um but anyway that's it everybody is doing well um I will be back next week hopefully early normal time for an update and thats it i hope everyone has a great weekend and i will be back soon take care right [Music] [Applause] you [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]"

sections section Alabama's in the path of it as well as Dutton Grant Hollywood Langston and piscis in areas that just got that one that's going through Walker and day County right now you got another one I'm gonna put this into motion for you and you see this is a very intense thunderstorm it has a possible tornado it's only radar indicated right now we do not have any reports of it being on the ground but that is until 11 o'clock Central Time moving to the northeast at 40 miles per hour right now I'm looking at that storm Todd in your Scottsboro at the present time and that storm is indicating right on the track if we go to the track let's go to the tracker for a second see right near Todd that is that's a little hook out go there possible yeah it's a possible tornado that's where we're looking at New Hope round 1116 this is actually stir in time so just subtract in our folks 16 at 22 FDR in Scottsboro just got an update their Hollywood 27 after the hour Bellefonte 28 after the hour 30 ft hour counts Pisco 32 fl Fackler 11 33 I'm going to zoom into that storm right into the heart of the storm right now if you live in Scottsboro you need to be taking your tornado safety propriety necessary is where the possible tornado could be let's take a look at okay right now we're not seeing any shear with that so but right now there's that possibility we're seeing a little bit of twisting in this motion and emotion right there so there could be a possible tornado with this as this storm Scottsboro right over here so be prepared through the Scottsboro from Asheville to Scottsboro within the next 15 minutes or so the storm is pretty intense and again downtown Scottsboro right here section over here the storm moving off towards the Northeast let's take a quick look at would go the bike but the Viper yeah let's take a look at the Viper again Todd's got something on your date no no we don't have any warnings in effect right now is it now for Ray County but near Dayton we are showing some type of twisting of the wind it could be just some strong down bursting winds possibly with that not looking at a tornado here yet on the Doppler but if you do live in Dayton you're not under a warning but you may want to you know stay away from the windows as there could be some very high winds in the Dayton area and Paul you've got that on the track I got the tracker right now on the date indicator Spring City are some very heavy rain we don't see any lightning with this right now saw I'm starting to feel that this storm may be elevated which means that it probably won't create a tornado at the present time but some very heavy rain through Rhea County right now way to Spring City near Evansville pushing off towards the Northeast and then there's another storm further off to the south we'll take a look at - right over Hamilton County yeah as a matter of fact we got another mess Oh right here this storm is uh this is unbelieving high so fast and the speeds on these storms are enormous I'm gonna back out of this for a second when I show you right here we got another mess oh yeah we got a mess on right here twenty-four thousand foot tops but the center of that storm and yet Brian around 11:20 Trenton 1122 Whiteside 11 26 27 FTL and while we're 27 well we'll look out Mountain George around 11:30 that's that storm that could be moving right over Hamilton County and right now in the eastern part of Chattanooga itself there's some very very intense storm going on now tremendous amounts of lightning with this storm I guess we got to go to a break right now but we'll be right back in just a minute what the forecast is yeah we will get to a forecast eventually here as well we'll continue our team coverage right after this well that's great

        "transcript": "all right for this review I'm going to show you a game that not many people know about but you've probably played it at least once within the past 10 years if you've used Windows 95 the game is Microsoft hover and Microsoft buried it in the windows 995 CD it it appeared on the auto run but you see not a lot of people had the auto run then and it's a 3D maze game which was amazing for the year 1995 now uh let's get it going it works on all versions of Windows all the way up to Vista not so much as uh one little bug which you'll see in a minute and I like how it says this we have detected that you are not running a 256 color video driver and what I just pointed at was the true color explanation mark that Windows XP displays all right so basically the premise of this game he wait minute something ain't right here here's the bug unless you go into sounds and click okay you're not going to get the music ah there we go music interesting midi music now the objective of this game is to go around and capture the enemy's blue flags before the enemy captures all of your red flags they have like five people against you but like four of them are people who attack you if they see you they really don't collect your flags so this game is basically pretty easy if you go around those red things on the bottom uh hold you if you get sucked in now what I like about this game is you can jump and leave behind walls and cloak that jump I just did there is probably one of the best parts of the game because you could you don't frequently see that in throwaway demos like these this game is basically just a throwaway demo to Showcase uh direct X for Windows 95 cuz a lot of games before that were programmed in Doss and this is pretty good to have a version of a game 3D game almost like Doom running in Windows 95 that was pretty amazing for the time now uh you get about three levels in this game but they they go on infinitely they just repeat or if you choose random they they'll go random there's basically not really much many interesting things about this game uh but for some reason i' I've liked it I've been playing this game for 11 years and I still play it occasionally there are some powerups you can get there in little bubble and uh what one of them is uh I love this one the green light which is coming up right here like right there see you just go at like 500 mph Max Speed you combine that with the shield power up and you basically own the level and here we go I like I said the levels just repeat except now in level four you have to collect more than three Flags uh video quality of [\u00a0__\u00a0] but uh you got four Flags to collect now so you can't really see it the most flags you'll have to collect is six it goes to six around uh level six as a matter of fact there's some things things to tell you about the uh what you see on the ground there those arrows if you if you go over them you you skid in the direction that you that they're pointing I don't know if I'm going to be able I don't know if I hit them or or what but uh those basically are just like the green light except you have no control I just picked up a spring there picked up a wall there you could drop walls behind your enemies and knock them into those uh blocks on the ground there there are blocks that if you skid into them who almost fell there if there are blocks that if you uh skid into them you lose a flag you lose a flag if you skit into them all right there's really not many interesting things to see her but let's see how you would have played this game on a typical computer in 1995 this is probably the quality I had it turned up all the way because any computer made past uh 1997 could handle it and uh this is the blockiness that uh I had to tolerate now if you really had a bad computer I'm talking like 486 you played it like this look at this this is if you had a crappy computer in 1995 I am dead serious I mean look I don't even know if I'm going to go heading into those flag removers or or the powerups you have to skit around the powerups to find out what they are and that's basically it as you could see I've had a few crazy game critic high scores now there's one last thing I want to show you there's a secret feature of this game well I got to turn the quality up uh you enter control shift then Bambi backwards which is I MBA a be I think I don't know and you get this you get to move around in the beginning level it has music too I'm going to put the music on it has music too and pictures of the developers look how awesome is that and this wall back here this is what I find funny these guys names they all start with Jay John John Joe Josh Joy Julie they put them all on the back wall and he On's that name that started with Jay here's all the other developers too it shows you did the sound with the mazes other than that there's really not much else to do here but I thought it was pretty interesting you know I've saw I've saw this level for like 11 years but I've never seen the back of it and uh that's basically it about Microsoft cover it's a pretty good game uh you can download it off the internet right from Microsoft's website they have it they might have it on their FTP server uh but it's a pretty good thing that check out if you're real I mean real real real bored because it's it's really not a spectacular game but it was good for its time and it's pretty good throwaway game uh they never made another version of hover even though the help file says to look for another one but I just think that would be awesome if they did and this is the crazy game critics signing out"

        "transcript": "hey youtube how you doing it's scott kazan the blue man and today we're gonna learn yo gabba gabba yo gabba gabba um these things are getting really popular and i'm getting a lot of requests for them and luckily i've hit the skill level where i just saw the pictures of them and i was able to make them right at the party first time ever um except for the robot guy and i also don't know any names of these guys so yeah but we're gonna make the pink one what's his name tutti fruity uh yobe roby i don't know just whatever okay so anyway guys the you can use um just regular old rounds but linkaloons would be much more helpful to make this design and i will show you why so let's blow it up and blow it up all right so pretty much we're gonna put these here but what makes this balloon character so easy to figure out is that it basically has a flower for a neck and a flower for a head and um i think 160s would be best served to make the flowers so here we go we're back so let's do five petal flowers for both i mean you could do six but i think five would work a little easier because don't forget for um you know when we put the flower on these also the arms are gonna go right there too and that's the part i haven't quite figured out yet but um maybe you will just a five petal flower this is literally the second time that i'm making this i originally saw gigantic centerpieces of the characters done by my good friend and colleague justin reeves he made uh five really big epidemic characters that are very elaborate very fancy and um i'm trying to show you how to make them for you know birthday parties events all right so here's what we have sorry i didn't show you on the camera but basically just tie this in and push that through simple enough so let's get the arms and legs going and the thing is about these designs is that they don't have to be ultra detailed made to perfection don't forget if you're making you'll get a character a goat gap a gap of character it's probably going to be for a two-year-old and two-year-olds are not picky as most of you would know all right so i'm gonna put a pinch twist there and then tie it into the link mode now again if you were using a round i would put a raisin because with a raisin you'd have a much easier time grabbing a bubble than trying to get a sidewall bubble i mean if you got the skills go ahead and use the sidewall bubble but i would recommend using a raising all right cool man all right so let's make the arms and oh i forgot something be right back and we're back all right so let's get the arms in and here's the thing getting the arms in it's gonna be a little tricky tricky business i'm thinking should i use a pinch twist or should i not use a pinch twist and i am thinking i will not use a pinch twist and i think it will work have it worked out just fine so what i'm thinking is you would put the arms kind of um it's a five petal flower in like the back so you can see the two loop three loops in the front if it's a six petal flower then i guess it would be three and three but you might have a harder harder time uh sticking it in so yeah all right that's already looking a lot like um what's that character's name i don't remember and she's got like a yellow center for the flower and i brought a yellow balloon here it is not too much hair and then that's why lingaloons are awesome because you got that extra knot instead of having using reason or sidewall bubbles i never used link balloons before this design so i finally have a reason to order them and that's the character essentially but artwork is really important for the yo gabba gabba characters as i have noticed it's buffer that's the name so guys at this point in time i would recommend using a paint pen that would make the balloon design um look really awesome here's this and then you're just gonna outline the eyes and draw a black circle in the middle and give it eyelashes all right guys i'm gonna let you look really closely at the eyes again my handwriting's terrible and um if you actually look at the picture the flower is kind of outward so i think that's a better look and it actually is a six petal flower flower on the character but like i said it's for if it's generally for a two-year-old no one's gonna say hey it's missing a pedal so anyway guys there is foofa the yoga character i will be showing you the other ones as well and i hope you guys enjoy this this has been a real stumper for me for a long time i got stumped on this design oh by the way don't forget there's a pinch twist back there that should help stabilize it alright guys you know what to do show some love"

        "transcript": "hey guys I'm going to try to demonstrate how to create a ringtone from a voice memo on HTC Evo every Evo has this uh default voice recorder app so I'm going to use that I'm going to create a a new memo just for the heck of it so let's try this all right now here we go [Music] and that's my ringtone all right so it's not a ringtone yet actually now it's just a voice memo but when I go here that's the one that I just recorded let's listen to it all right all right now what I'm going to do is I'm going to rename it so hold press and hold and now first I'm going to rename it to let's say Bo and save and now I'm going to press and hold and select uh set as ringtone and you will see here file was set as a ringtone and now it's actually done uh I have to do is go to menu settings and then go to sound it's right here on the menu settings and phone ringtone it's already set I mean let me let me try let's see okay now if you don't want this to be your default then you select your previous default and then after that you can select this one to be a custom but but in any case that that's that's it that's basic Bally all you have to do is just go to your voice recorder application record a memo or if you already have one you just press and hold select set as ringtone and that's it now don't forget this is going to be a default ringtone so if you want to customize ring ringtones and if you want to use this as a custom ringtone for somebody or some of your people then you may want to go back into your or uh settings under uh menu settings sound and select uh different default uh ringtone but that's it thanks for watching and in the next in the next uh video I'm going to demonstrate how to get rid of these custom ringtones see you later"

        "transcript": "hey guys what's up i'm prof snipe and this is the m98b review for battlefield play for free the barrett model 98b also known as the 98 bravo was an american bolt action sniper rifle manufactured by barrett firearms manufacturing in battlefield play for free the m98b is a rank 30 bolt action sniper rifle for the recon class the looks of the weapon are not very surprising i was expecting something different but it does resemble a lot like the m82 a3 one thing i really like is the magazine design and the way it looks whenever you reload you actually get to see the bulletin side which i thought was pretty cool the satellite mix is pretty awesome too it definitely does sound like a threatening weapon the default scope of the m98b is definitely a unique one the reticle itself is not the exclusive part it's the zoom factor this is the first default site in the game that can zoom in at different levels which is pretty awesome this weapon has four levels of magnification there is not a huge difference between all of them but it still provides an additional zoom over here i was standing at 99 meters away from the mcom and if you take a look at the first second third and fourth zoom level you will notice that difference this weapon comes with three magazines of six bullets giving you 18 bullets in total the reload time is one of the most impressive stats which clocks in at 4.4 seconds the m98 has a projectile velocity of 475 meters per second which is definitely not the best for our long-range sniper rifle this weapon comes with the rate of fire 30 which is a medium bolt action it is not faster than the m24 gol l96 and others but it is faster than the m95 and the m82a3 the damage is definitely not the most impressive stat of the weapon and in my opinion is the most needed to be upgraded the range is average and mimics the exact same as the m82a3 and the m95 as you can see by the table on screen the initial damage is of course the strongest but the long range damage lacks a lot it is that bad that sometimes it can be a 3 shot body shot for 110 hp users and a 2 shot headshot for example i hit 109 on an enemy's head which got me pretty frustrated and made me wish i was using attachments deviation and recoil is not an aspect i'll talk too much about since it's not the most important factor for his bolt action sniper rifle's performance but i will oblige you not to move while shooting as it really ruins your accuracy always stay still the hipfire's accuracy is not the most consistent and should not be the selling point of any sniper rifle but i found myself landing pretty accurate hipfire shots with this thing i don't know if it was luck or not but it felt very rewarding in fact my first ever kill with this gun was a no scope this weapon is a very interesting one because of the fact that it is a medium bolt action it's not really fast to be too close but not too slow to be too far it can be used anywhere but i would suggest sticking at medium range because of the fact that being too close won't really be good unless you can get your first shot than pistol weapon staying too far isn't the best because of the damage that is very low at extreme ranges so for that reason stick at medium range don't be too aggressive i would also suggest sticking with one magnification level because switching between all of them will confuse your bullet drop for attachments i would go for the precision barrel the less bullet drop you have the better range is not really an issue here and there's not to be augmented so lowering the bullet drop is the way to go viper max cqc max high power ammo and even piranha mags is the way to go as well i would suggest using viper mags though because adding more ammo is always better finally the stock does not even matter so you don't even need to use one the maps i would play this weapon on is omon karkhand mesh tour and pretty much any map that isn't small because you can still be playing the objective while covering them from a distance and a vantage point i see reserve type of players using this weapon more as it's not the fastest and will not satisfy the aggressive recons as much for my final rating i'll give this weapon an 8.8 out of 10. it's a unique weapon not the most out of the ordinary and stunning weapons but with attachments it does achieve what the m95 can do but with a faster rate of fire faster reload time and with more ammo thank you for watching the m98b commentary and review i hope you guys did enjoy make sure to leave a like if you did and want to support the channel if you have a video idea please request it in the comment section down below also be sure to check the videos on screen if you haven't already my name is professor snipe and i'll see you guys next time"
