        "transcript": "hey guys it's me mr mason coming at you i know it's been so long since i made a video it's like easter like right before easter and i apologize guys um but today i'm coming at you guys to talk about moisturizing your hair to help it grow um recently i cut i had a whole lot of split ends um so i i cut my hair i cut my split ends and my hair my bangs used to be like way down here and no actually there was like a little bit longer well nevertheless they are they have been cut um i've cut split ends all over my head um and since i've cut them i've noticed that my hair looks a lot healthier um so first one i'm talking about is the shampoo that i use i use motions lavish conditioner shampoo it has keratin in it um and i wash my hair every i try to do it every week but if not every two weeks and the keratin does make your hair stronger and healthier um and i like the way it smells so after i wash my hair with the um carrots and shampoo i do a leave-in conditioner um i do organics best olive oil leave-in conditioner um it's water-based instead of it's like i don't know if you can see it it's like really liquidy it's not like regular conditioner that's really really creamy um if you have a really creamy conditioner it leaves build up behind if you can't rinse it out all the way so i use the olive oil and then i use the motions nourish leave-in conditioner i use this every day faithfully every day um i like the way it smells i spray it on my roots and spray it all over um this also has keratin um and it can help you detangle your hair but even though i've cut my ends i haven't seen any kind of detangling um and then i switched to my oils i use hot six oil um i spray this on my body i spray it on my hair it's just this is some good oil i think i paid like six or seven dollars at my beauty care you know you might be able to find it cheaper um i just started using organics best olive and clove oil so far i've had really good results it's enriched olive oil egg protein mink oil jojoba oil vitamin e silk protein honey milk protein cholesterol and herbal extracts and it smells good too um i use this one too i use it every now and then to me it's too it's too greasy i guess you can say or maybe it's just that i put too much on at times and it runs it it drips all over um and i use afrocentric hot the um twist and lock the itch-free herbal conditioner sham um spray excuse me want to say shampoo um i used to spread this on my hair every day i need to get another one but i swear i used to spread this on my hair to wake my hair up in the mornings my daily routine consists of spraying my hair with the leave-in conditioner and then going back and running the other leave-in conditioner i run it from the roots all the way to the ends and then i would put either one of the oils in um one of my followers on twitter i don't know what her name is on um youtube but she knows who she is hey girl um she asked me to tell her what a hot or treatment is and basically what a hot oil treatment is um after you wash your hair you put in whatever kind of oil say for instance i want to use this olive and clove oil after i wash my hair i put this on from the roots all the way to the ends and i will put a shower cap on either you can after you do that after you put the shower cap on either you can take a hot shower and let that steam build up and the oil is going to penetrate all throughout the hair and it's going to give the hair a healthy shine it's going to moisturize it from inside from the inside out well outside and shineless there so you can either take a hot shower with the shower cap on you can sit under a hooded dryer or you can put the shower cap on after you put the oil in and you can take a towel and wrap it around your head so it keeps the heat in um some people go and decide that they want to wash i mean rinse the oil out it's all up to you but me personally with my hair being as dry as it is and it's color treated i do not wash it out i try to massage it as best as i can so it's not all drippy because i don't want to um have oil all over my um all over my pillow cases so whatever works best for you uh if you guys have any questions or comments feel free to ask a question or leave a comment and don't forget to follow me on twitter at marley re all right guys um there's more videos to come we're gonna do a major update of the style that i've worn this past year and i'm getting ready to start my four year uh lock a bursary video it's a big it's a big year it's gonna be certainly four years old so all right guys love you bye"

        "transcript": "hey guys welcome back to vinceville customs uh today i'm sharing with you a superman kit that i put together for someone now there's a few things about this kit and when you get a hold of him he comes with legs arms torso head cape and bass it actually came with an extra right arm so you can have two options basically you can have the arm where he's out there has the fist up or you have another arm which is based like this but down to the side so you get to pick which one i guess you want you can't really do a change of arm because if you did you would have um basically a seam going across so you have to pick one or the other and also the other thing i did with him which uh the client requested was his uh his shorts they were they were more of a shorts they came down to here and it didn't look like superman so he basically wanted to go with the white white tighties uh basically outfit so basically what i had to do was sand up a little bit there and create the scene going around so that worked out pretty good now he is a very big kid i mean this sucker is like almost uh 21 inches tall from top bottom of the base of the top of the head so it's he's pretty big he's not small at all and it's all solid resin which is good i think the base is just a little bit of hollow not that big of a deal but it works out so uh what i had to do was i had to figure out how to put him together with painting and getting the cape on because if you put everything together then you try to paint it's very difficult to get up in here so basically what i did was i did the bottom half first and then after i got the bottom half together i put the cape onto the body but what i did was i painted everything first well at least i painted the blues i painted all the cape red i did the skins so once that was done what i did was i attached the cape onto him and what i had was a couple pins going in i put the pins in let them set had them all glued up and then i painted it and matched it all back together because that was the only way i could come up with the idea so once i got the idea of how to put them together i went ahead and did it it required some thinking what was the best option how to do it and make life easier and so basically you had to paint it while putting it together it was only option so once that was all done and he was all set i then attached the top of the body to the bottom of the body and that worked out pretty cool um some other things i i did with him uh he comes with uh two kind of like pins in the feet so what i did was i gave a pin to this leg and then i left that key in the other leg so i made a pin for there and i made it for there so he fits in pretty good now so instead of uh sawing off this uh key here i left that there and i gave a nice uh metal peg going in there and that worked out good so he's nice and solid because the reason why i did that if he left the regular keys and to try to put him in he would be so backwards heavy with the cape he would just fall out but now that i got that in there it works out pretty good so with that being said i'll explain how i did some of the painting basically i went with garage kits uh flesh tones and what we did was we gave him metallic eyes blue so it's kind of like he's got the heat vision going in a way um as you can see it kind of shines so that worked out pretty cool and for the cape we went with uh you know basically like a reddish leather there's some browns and stuff mixed into them uh the same thing with the whitey tighty area the boots you know as for the blue it's kind of like um it's like a mix of blue with some pearls in it just to give it kind of like a spandex type look so it worked out pretty good and as for his symbol the symbol is not actually complete pearl but there is some pearls and metallics mixed into it so it's kind of like shiny but it's not overly you know metallic popping out at you and i did the sort of the same thing with the s in the back it's got some pearl mix into it not a lot but enough for it to pop now you may see a lot of sheen shine on him at the moment that's because uh my lights are really strong here but it worked out good hair has a little bit of a blue in it hard to see in the camera but in person and you'll see it but a good kit very big a lot of fun now as for the bass uh the idea is that the bass is from his fortress of solitude now instead of just throwing straight white in there uh you know i talked to the client it was like maybe we should make some blue but then what i did was i threw in a lot of this uh i had this like pearlized ink type stuff and i did a lot of washes and i got a lot of that in there so it actually feels like it is as fortunate as a solid tube but in certain way to get like a sheen and shine of blues and whites so it's kind of very uh shiny which is kind of cool so i think it worked out for this kit especially with the base so it was a fun kit uh pretty big definitely uh definitely had to really think about how to put them together and of course the belt nice little shiny belt buckle regular yellow so hopefully you guys like the way he came out was a lot of fun and we'll see you next time"

Ed Welburn you might want to think about getting rid of your I know they're nice old Camaros because we just produce a classic that you may want to replace it with these guys are the heart and soul that team Dave Lyon and his team and the engineers and the designers we even had people that work on this team drive to New York from Detroit to see this event that's the kind of soul and spirit that went into this car I'm so proud of this team I'd like to bring up all the engineers and designers who are instrumental in getting this Chevrolet performance to this point so please join me on stage for a closer look thanks for being here we're excited about these cars let me tell you thank you"

        "transcript": "we're studying how the nervous system generates behavior and a nervous system has to process sensory information and translate that sensory information in a coordinated motor output usually by coordinating different Independent Motor programs and for instance if you try to swat a fly if a fly flies away it actually has to coordinate its leg lift and it's Wing flapping just to avoid being actually uh crushed by a fly swatter see how an does something very similar in the Escape response it moves in a sinusoidal motion and on top of that it also moves its head back and forth to sample its micro environment now if you touch the animal just behind the head with an eyelash then the animal will start backing up and during this backing it will actually suppress these head movements and at the end of the reversal it will uh turn around and move away from the stimulus and resume these head movements and there are also other mutants actually that we've identified that uh fail to suppress these head movements in response to touch great thing about C Elegance is that we know a tremendous amount of detail about the neural circuit uh we know exactly how all the neurons are connected what kind of synapses and GAP Junctions they make so we know how the sensory information flows in the nervous system and the seelan touch response is actually one of the very few examples where we know the complete path of sensory neuron to interneuron to motor neuron so we know exactly the underlying structures that control Behavior the one thing that we actually do not know very well uh is the why of the behavior so why would the animal suppress these head movements in response to touch just behind the head but actually it does not suppress these head movements when you touch it at the tail or at the tip of the nose in the laboratory we grow celegans on Ager plates but in the wild uh seans thrives in in decaying organic matter so some of the main predators of nematodes in the wild are these predacious fungi and these predacious fungi theyve developed very sophisticated hyle structures to to catch nematodes and the most ingenious one is is the one that uses constricting rings and these these hyle Rings consist of three cells and when a nematode comes along and moves through this ring then the the mechanical stimulation of the Ring cells leads these ring to inflate and ENT trap the nemone and eventually hyi will actually perforate the cuticle of the worm and the worm will be digested by the fungus while trap inflation occurs quickly once started uh there's Delay from the initial contact of the worm with the inside of the Trap and ring inflation and this allows the animal Small Time window to carefully uh retract and escape from a trap the beauty of the Elegance is U that you can do genetics so there are all kinds of mutants available you can make trenic there you can use green fluorescent markers to label certain populations so now we can really test the contributions of different genes uh in a predator prey interaction We performed a competition assay where we mixed populations of wild typ worms and mutant worms one of them labeled with a green fluorescent marker what we found was that animals That Couldn't suppress their head movements were caught much more efficiently than the wild worms by the spuni indicating that suppression of head movements May provide a selective advantage to surviving fungal Encounters in the natural environment this raises the Intriguing possibility that maybe this Behavior has evolved as as a result of selective pressures that have been imposed by predacious fungi and that maybe uh the constricting ring and the suppression of head movements are part of an evolutionary arms raise since we know the molecular and neuronal bases of this behavior in C Elegance we can now look at these receptors and neurotransmitters and other species to get an idea maybe how this Behavior has uh evolved"

        "transcript": "yo what's going on you guys this is cod flaw and in today's video I'm going to be showing you guys some secret police vehicles on GTA 5 online and also a possibility of being able to store them perhaps in the near future so I'm basically just going to show you guys the spawn locations of the secret police vehicles and also some awesome information about them so I know this is kind of old but I never actually posted it to my channel I just want to share these rare vehicles with you guys but if you already knew about them I'm sorry about that but still stay tuned for the whole video because I got some great news about them so before I do start if you guys can drop down a like on the video that'd be greatly appreciated and also subscribe to my channel so you guys stay updated with all the latest GTA5 content so to get these super police vehicles all you guys want to do is come to this location on the map that I'm going to be showing you guys a little later on but it's by these satellites over here and the possible vehicles that could spawn is the FI B Buffalo or the FIB SUV and they spawn at around 10:00 and as you guys can see both of them were FIB um SUVs for me now either both of them could be FIB SUVs both of them could be FIB Buffalos or it could be one of each so in my case there was two FIB SUVs so if you guys want different ones to spawn just drive away and then drive back and then different ones should respawn and this is basically 100% confirmed spawn location for these vehicles as long as it's 10:00 so if nothing does spawn just drive away and drive back and it should be there so once you guys come to this location at the right time of day the two vehicles will spawn and you guys can get into either or which ones you guys do prefer in my personal opinion the FIB Buffalo is the best one so all you guys have to do is simply get inside of the vehicle at at least 10:00 and for me it was like 11:00 so you guys could you know make it at around that time and this is where it is actually on the map so just get into the vehicle and make sure once you guys do get in drive away very quickly because the agents and the scientists will start shooting at you to make sure you guys do drive away very quickly so these are unmarked police vehicles so it doesn't show the sirens on them but to actually turn them on just clicked your left analog stick and then the flashing light should turn on so unfortunately these awesome sexy vehicles are not available to be stored inside of your garage but they once were with the glitch that was soon patched and a lot of people did actually love them inside of their garages it was a great addition but unfortunately they're still not able to be stored but perhaps in the future they will so a big shout out goes out to my friend Fantastical Gamers link is going to be down inside of the description below and also an annotation on the screen because he did find this information out by himself he was just going around through the social club website and he discovered like a petition page where you guys could write down your ideas and send them to Rockstar and then other people could vote them up and it could be potentially seen by Rockstar and Rockstar could take into consideration and make an update and Implement into the game and I'm not actually saying that my friend found the page in case you guys are a little bit confused he just figured it out and a lot of people may not have known about it and I'm just bringing this awesome page to you guys' attention so basically there's a petition page on the Rockstar support website the link is going to be down inside of the description for that and also the link for this one that a person actually wrote for a petition to allow police vehicles inside of your garage and bring in the LSPD Buffalo into online and this is the most voted petition on the Rockstar support website it has over 1,300 votes so if you guys want to have police vehicles inside of the game make sure to click the link down below and vote this petition if you guys do agree with it and you guys could also write your own so what this petition States is vote up if you agree these vehicles are not overpowered and some people with Crews or role playing characters are greatly hindered here I can understand getting rid of the tanks buzzards and jets in garage but the cop cars weren't ruining any players experience I felt when I had these cars inside of my garage I was getting a great play experience and was getting more out of the game and a good old game of cops and robbers is what GTA needs so like I said this is the number one voted petition on the Rockstar support website so this could definitely be coming into GTA V online so definitely do comment down what you guys think about this and if you guys did enjoy today's video make sure to leave a like down below and subscribe to my channel so you guys never miss a future GT5 video from me and this has been Cod flaing them out peace thanks for watching [Music]"

        "transcript": "hi guys this will be the first in my series of videos for helping you learn Japanese maybe helping you yeah mom learned some chef Feenie's but using the Bible to do that and I I I like to use the violin I recommend using the Bible because it's something that we all know pretty well so for example I can pick up a Japanese Bible as long as we're in you know the New Testament and I can read through different parts of Matthew Mark Luke and John you know the Gospels and I can you know I could just read a couple sentences before I know what the story is and because we know it so well it's easy to figure out what he's talking about even if you don't have a really strong footing in Japanese it's still possible to figure that out alright and this is one of the ways that I started learning Japanese when I first came to Japan was I took my Bible and my wife's Bible and at the dictionary and between those three or between my Bible and the dictionary I could figure out I could read my wife's Bible alright it's a bit slow but I just wrote him down and then you know I'm just I could just put off my little notebook every day and I could just read it in Japanese and then I could read the English version and it seemed to work for me it especially worked for me for learning how to read kanji or learning some good kanji especially some cool words like she do bukai and some things you don't hear very often and if you use Japanese people go wow what have you been packed that remember one day one of the guys was working with he said John what have you been studying with the dictionary uh yeah but anyway so here's today's verse I like to do it with proverbs because proverbs are short and sweet it's not a whole story and you can learn some interesting vocabulary and some interesting kanji too that uh even sometimes Japanese people want to but they certainly might not use it very often but it's awesome to know alright if you can learn it and you might want to watch this video many times like if you just watch the video every day for like the next two weeks you'll be set you have this memorized all right so here we go here it is proverbs chapter 12 verse 1 whoever loves discipline loves knowledge but he who hates correction is stupid and I'm using the the New International Version here all right whoever loves discipline loves knowledge but he who hates correction is stupid all right cool so that was the English version now I'm going to read it to you in Japanese and then we'll break it down after that again proverbs 12 verse 1 here we go satoshi oh I should hit the lot chicky o icer karashi me oniy kumamon OA autocad ah alright did you get that so I'll read it one more time for you Satoshi oh I sewer hito wa TC oh I su karashi make karashi mayo nakooma mono wa or Okada or acaba all right so now I'm gonna break it down alright first off we've got Satoshi oh I Souter hito Satoshi oh hi Souter heat over look look at my Bible whoever loves discipline loves knowledge that's the first part of the verse alright whoever loves discipline loves knowledge Satoshi mmm could that be discipline I think so in fact when I looked it up it translated as Satoshi it comes from the verb Seto sewer it means to admonish her warned so ie anumana SH meant a warning as my Bible says discipline - discipline alright so Satoshi oh I Souter hito I being loved I salute to love Heath of being person so I should hit the person that loves Satoshi person that loves discipline alright Satoshi Oh isurugi Toa chicky-chicky is knowledge translates as knowledge right kikyo i Souter Satoshi Oh isurugi Toula kikyo i Souter oka cheese karai Souter that means you love knowledge alright the person that loves this loves knowledge all right we got that part the second part second sentence in this Japanese version Karachi Mayo nakooma Manawa or Okada so what does Cora she may mean well that that's that comes from the verb karachi mater which means dududu dududududu to punish to chastise or to discipline all right to punish to chastise or to discipline so ie punishment or chastisement or discipline or nakooma Mona the Mon oh there that means person Mona can also be like a thing but in this case the character for that is person all right niku mu means hate but not like they have taken lightly kind of hate like a real almost abusive kind of hate for example most Japanese people when they say when for example wouldn t tweening glish we would say I hate something I hate that Japanese people say I got kid I die he died all right but that niku mu is like a really like you really makes you very angry that kind of fate you know I'm not the very flippant kind of hate that we use all the time for example well Jesus always used niku mu for in the chapter of John there when he was saying if they hate you if they hated me that they will hate you as well the word that he used was nakumo alright so a really really really strong hate all right so guy karashi Mayo nakooma mono a person who really hates discipline whoa Otto coda or Okada portico or oak or Okada or oka means fool all right or Okada is a fool so the person that hates discipline is a fool okay so now that you got the whole thing remember big words we had Satoshi isurugi toe cheeky karashi made nakumo nakooma mono and auto cop all right those are the big words and then already one more time Satoshi o icer hito wa cheeky o icer karashi mayo nakooma mono wa o tada thank you for watching have a nice day"

        "transcript": "my life is all about fun and knowing how to live it okay that was a horrible Housewives impression today we're doing a tutorial for how to get that Housewives Hair W yeah don't look at the back cuz I didn't really do it okay so um this is really easy and all you'll need is a curling iron and an assist from a flat iron perhaps um if you need it but I will show you how to do this and it takes like under 5 minutes super easy oh and hairspray Housewives have to have hairspray let's do it start by sectioning off your hair into oh my gosh I have a huge cluster of stuff over here into um like do the bottom part first and then take a pretty big curling iron um you don't want like a super skinny one like an inch or something because it'll make it too curly and not more wavy which is what we're going for ow this is hot okay so what you want to do is just flip the wand upside down like this and take like not a huge section of hair like a medium section of hair and just start wrapping it around the barrel and just wrap it around and hold and hold it there as long as you would like a normal you know like if you're actually just curling your hair with a curling iron so just for a few seconds and then you can see it's got a great little wave to it so you'll just want to go around your whole head and and you don't really have to worry about the back as much you're more worrying about like the face framing layers um that's the biggest part I mean you want these to be somewhat wavy but you don't have to worry about them being like super perfectly formed curls and you actually if for this part if you're scared of burning your hand um they actually make gloves you want to go over the barrel not under you always want the curls to be pointing like towards the back of your head okay so that's the bottom part and this curling iron is even a little bit thick for what we're doing um I really have one like I needed one that's in between like a 1 and 1 half probably inch barrel would be perfect um so what I'm going to do next is show you like what to do around the face since that's really the part that you're going to see most so you get the idea you're going to do that whole thing like around your head um so around the face you're going to do the the whole thing over again and just try to hold it like as close as you can to the barrel where you're stopping um like you know what I mean like the end of your hair hold it as close to the barrel as you can so you do get a curl on the end and not just like a droopy sad cuz like these are kind of Droopy sad so I might go back and do those again um and my like my fake hair and my weave is like harder to curl so my real hair is much easier cuz it's really thin so I always keep a flat iron on too so I can fix like any issues that might arise while I'm doing this mess okay so I mean you're just going to continue doing all the same stuff I always leave my bangs for last just kind of leave them in a little clip here just continue doing that same going back with the curling iron around your face oh you can't see that at all aiming back I'm doing squats right now so I'm getting a good workout too go aim back back back back [Music] back and I hope this gives you like a good enough idea cuz I really don't want to do my whole head because if I'm nothing if I mean I'm not anything if I'm not lazy like I'm super lazy okay same thing over here and try to hold it like a you know um my my brain is not working today try to hold it vertically cuz that will give you the best shape and then when I get to the top I usually do use the little um clamp on the curling arm and you want to kind of just curl backwards and you don't even really need to hold it just kind of run the curling iron through so you get that little wave you know how they have like The Little Wave on the side that's what you'll do if you have your hair parted like to one side or the other just follow that direction of whatever way you have your hair parted does that make any sense I feel like I'm not making any scense at all today like I'm speaking gibberish so I apologize my brain is just crazy today so okay see see how you get The Little Wave deal wave wave so that's it like super easy and then you definitely would want a hairspray I'm not going to cuz I don't want to today but you would definitely want a hairspray because I mean you have to keep this the curled look um cuz that's what gives it that Housewives glamour look so I feel like car Electra for some reason and then once again another tip keep a flat iron um handy just in case you have any kinks that you need to work out see like I see a little piece right here that I'm not really liking so I'll just kind of curl that back and maybe the bottom isn't curled enough and so I'll just use this to kind of curl it because it's fast see it's like not that Curly curled over here not that Curly curled okay so that's it guys now you have your oh excuse me there now you have your Housewives qua and you look like Gretchen or Tamara or whoever you're trying to look like and um yeah so I would definitely fluff this a little more hairspray it and you are good to go see you later"

something I got a man of the match Cavani as well that was [\u00a0__\u00a0] something but man of much man of the match Rodrigo I'll take it cuz that's the best thing I've had this year apart from I've had three agero and a man of the match so all I have to do now to complete Fe for is get Messi Ronaldo and a legend so it's not that much to ask for it'll happen it'll happen someday probably on like the last [\u00a0__\u00a0] day of FIFA CU I've only ever had a Messi once in a pack and that was on that was in like the last week of FIFA 12 when he was worth like 200k I almost crowed myself to sleep all right we only got a few more packs left to go though boom there's your busets and we got the Spanish Diego Costa as well uh we'll keep Costa and the contracts I don't know why I'm keeping all these contracts man got like 400 in my club not like I need anymore holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] I still can't believe I got inform Rodrigo in my first pack as well first [\u00a0__\u00a0] pack of the day I never usually get informs in my first pack I wish I open that with coins now just open one pack pack opening done I got myself an inform with like I think he was going for 300K when I checked we got Muller uh and 2K coins not too bad not too bad valra is a decent cam as well as usual we'll keep the contract and fitness Fitness Fitness Fitness Fitness I've already got a m uh get my coins don't want to discard those like a [\u00a0__\u00a0] tool and discard actually no we'll put you on the transfer list and then discard the rest in come on make this even better a boy I don't even know how to pronounce your name um not even going to try it either and last pack of the day I can't complain about this pack opening though even though all the other packs apart from the first one were kind of [\u00a0__\u00a0] the first one definitely made it worth it Soo eh he average is's a decent player I keep hunt ht's pretty decent uh and yeah shitload of contracts and chemistry Styles so all right that's the end of that so on the screen right now is that Dempsey pack pull that I was talking about um earlier I pulled a [\u00a0__\u00a0] inform and um man of the match in the space of 24 hours I'm got to be happy with that so yeah hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video don't forget to leave a like and also subscribe if you're new and leave a comment down below of your best pack pull but till

        "transcript": "welcome to gear 65 today we are taking a look at the Dell XPS 15 Z this is a notebook computer and um so I just going to start with a disclaimer first um at Tech 65 we don't do benchmarking and performance test and all that kind of stuff so if you're looking for that kind of stuff this is not the video to watch I mean why do you want to watch a video for performance test right you look at paper and you look at specs for all that kind of stuff uh we're going to be showing you the design of the delx PSX as well as some of the software features of the Dell XPS uh 15 and uh well of course the first thing you notice is it comes with a very interesting box uh I don't recommend you actually using this box as like a some sort of a suitcase to carry your laptop around that would be kind of strange but um this is the 15 Z it is a little heavy it's uh it's 2.5 kg so um yeah well it is 15 in so I guess that's probably um you know it deserves to be that heavy so um let's take a look at the design uh what can you find on this machine um so the battery is actually integrated so that's one of the first things that you will find very interesting about this computer um and uh so you can see there very nice grills all over the place uh we've got power you've got ethernet it's right here and this thing really is heavy and on this side you have a whole bunch of pots HDMI over here this is display port and over here you have eSATA with the USBs and you got three USB ports in total so meaning that this is both an eSATA Port as well as a USB port so you can pluck in both you either eSATA drive or you can pluck in the USB stuff and this is an SD card slot a battery indicator light so I've only got about two out of five battery life um this is an optical drive a DVD optical drive um it's not Blu-ray unfortunately uh headphones as well as microphones so that's um that's pretty much it let's open up the lid and so um this computer itself is running on a 15in dis that's why it's called a 15 Z it's a 15-in display and the display resolution is pretty amazing this is a 1 1920 by 1080 in other words this is a 1080p display of course uh however you need to actually opt for the 1080p option so the uh the normal model doesn't come with 1080p okay um you've got the keyboard right here it's got a uh this a chicklet type of keyboard and you have two speaker grills at the side touchpad over here and this design is a very familiar looking design this design actually looks a lot like the hpn V right which looks a lot like the MacBook Pro so you know that's there's pretty much you know um there's nothing to there's no point beating about the bush this is another one of those machines out there that's trying to look like the MacBook the MacBook Pro the 15in MacBook Pro I mean look at the speaker grills and all that kind of stuff um that is what they're trying to do and uh we're not going to you know say anything about that cuz it's pretty obvious already okay so that's what it is uh it's a Chate keyboard and and um the keyboard is actually quite all right it's soft it's not too difficult to press and all on all that so you know we're quite fine with the keyboard itself um and this is a trackpad the interesting thing about this trackpad this is actually a multi-touch trackpad so I can just show you the things you can do with it um so if you actually use two fingers so this one's kind of obvious two fingers is a scroll so come to let's say TCH 65 uh two fingers is scroll and uh you can also do pinch to zoom so you can come zoom in and out of course it's not that smooth but you know it works okay um and you can use the the the back the three fingers to go forward and back so three fingers forward three fingers back you can use four fingers if you put four fingers up um so it doesn't it's not you know exactly something that you'll be using a lot cuz it's not that responsive but if you use four fingers it brings up the uh the alternate Tab and uh four finger down that's uh supposed to give you the desktop so there you go so it's it's not that exactly that fantastically sensitive um but well it's there and here's one that's actually kind of interesting if you use see your four fingers in slight to the left and then use one of the fingers to kind of do a little bit of flicking you can do that 3D uh Arrow flip thing which um which is quite interesting so that's the the the gestures that you can actually do on the Dell XPS 15 um the other thing that you can do uh that comes with the the Dell itself is the Dell stage so this is something that it's a name that you is probably familiar to you because this was on the the the Dell Streak Android devices and um what they are is pretty much you know they're shortcuts right so you got Shortcuts To The Music you got shortcuts to game uh photos and things like that and you can have shortcuts to Applications um as well as shortcuts to websites so you know uh you can create these things where you can uh have screenshots of the web pages and jump to them and you can also add more of these web tiles they call them right so um that that is uh pretty much you know the software stuff on this thing um the specs on this this this machine itself um it's is well it's not too bad I mean of course you I already told you about the the 1080p display um and it it does have a Intel Core i7 it's a dual core core i7 at 2.7 GHz 8 gab of ram um and uh you know all your usual stuff 2 GB of Graphics RAM and uh it's an Nvidia graphics card by the way so um yeah um in terms of specs and Hardware you know just visit the D website you can find out all about it for us the priority is really about showing you some of the unique software features as well as all the poorts and the you know the keyboard and touchpad and all that kind of stuff so yeah that that is actually pretty much um that uh what we want to tell you about this Dell XPS 15 Z it is a 15-in notebook computer that looks a lot like the MacBook Pro as well as the HP EnV and um yeah it's a pretty powerful machine and it doesn't cost as much as the hpmv or the MacBook Pro that's the the good part about it it's close to it's less than 1,300 Singapore dollars right so that for that kind of price for the amount of power that you can get it's it's it's not too bad all right and this is the Dell XPS 15 Z and if

        "transcript": "hey I'm Justin you for cet.com this is a first look at the HP Officejet Pro x576 DW printer so the pro in the name is a good tip that this printer is meant for small businesses and Home Offices looking for a Workhorse printer it's also 799 bucks but with plenty of extra features you won't find with other printer manufactures it's really well worth the cost for those that really need a high output device and it's the top-of-the-line model in the X series of Office Jet printers from HP and it's a big guy as you can see it measures 20.3 in tall and 20.3 in wide but it's actually easy to pick up and move around thanks to the small grooves on the side here where your hands go and the bulk of the size is because of the two paper trays that feed media into the printer there's one on the bottom that can hold up to 500 sheets of paper and there's another 50 sheet multi-purpose tray on the side where you can put photo paper or card stock whatever you want and finally there's another 50 sheet Auto document feeder on top that one's used for putting stacks of documents to be scanned handsfree so you don't have to sit around and monitor the job so the really Innovative part of the x576dw is found behind this panel here it gives you a quick look at the duplexer and a little bit of the new print head the print head is part of the printer that usually moves back and forth to place ink on various parts of the paper but this one by HP sits in one place and lets the paper do the work moving back and forth across all the little ink nozzles now the benefit of this new ink system means big improvements in print quality and especially speed HB brags that this can print about 70 pages of text per minute and while our test results don't exactly fit that claim it's certainly just as fast as competing Laser Printers that are known for their speed the x576dw uses four different types of inks that install behind this door in the front there's one for cyan one for magenta another for yellow and of course black using hp's ink cost in their online store we estimate that a page of black text costs about 2.2 cents while a page of color will set you back 3.2 cents per page that's about average compared to a laser but it is a lot less than most inkjets you can also save a little bit of money in the long term by investing in hp's high capacity ink tanks up front so there's a lot of options on how to connect this printer to your computer too you can hook it up through a hardwired USB port in the back here or you can connect it to an Ethernet Network for an array of computers but the best way to do it is definitely through the Wi-Fi network the Wi-Fi server inside's going to sniff out any open networks and of course prompt you for your password before it connects after that's done though you'll be able to use all of hp's exclusive cloud printing features when I say cloud printing I mean that you can print from this thing from a mobile phone from an internet browser or a web connected device that can access email this 4.3 in screen up top is also one of the unique features and something we've grown to love about HP there's an app store built into the display that's similar IL to a smartphone screen and it lets you download various apps that make it really easy to print out games for kids sports scores the news of the day Etc you can also plug your own USB storage drive into this port here and forego the computer entirely so you can read even more details about this device including speed test results and comparison test products but that's going to do it for me I'm Justin you you just took a first look at the HP Office Jet Pro x576dw thanks for watching"

        "transcript": "hey hey hey hi everybody this is Fe Master Charles galof welcoming you to this video on the scotch opening so uh on this video I'm going to show you theoretically how you get to the scotch and then I'll show you a little bit of theory so let's get started after E4 E5 Knight F3 Knight C6 D4 this is the mother position of the scotch opening and what could we say about the opening well basically gar gasparo who is considered to be by many one the best player that ever that has ever played chess uh he has said that uh the scotch is the only real alternative to the ru Lopez to gain an advantage as white so with that said black typically plays Pawn takes D4 Knight takes D4 now the main move is Knight F6 but black has some Alternatives Bishop C5 is one Bishop B4 is one and queen to H4 is the other one so let's go ahead and start off with Queen to H4 this is probably the worst of the Alternatives this is a hyper aggressive way of playing it was uh developed by um William stanit but okay here we typically play Knight C3 Bishop B4 Bishop B2 and here black has two variations he could capture on C3 after which white just castles and white has enough compensation what's going to happen in this game and you're going to see it over and over and over again in all these in all these in games with this position is that white is going to have the initiative for the rest of the game black is going to play passively until either white makes a mistake in his attack or white crushes black uh in either the dark squares or as a result of you know the king uh being misplaced so going back uh alternatively there is Queen takes C4 after which we play Knight to B5 and here um there are two moves there's Queen takes G2 and there's Bishop takes C3 if Bishop C3 then simply Pawn takes and after King d8 we castle and once again we have the initiative for the rest of the game otherwise uh if Queen G2 then Bishop F3 and after Queen H3 Knight C7 we're completely winning so going back uh to this position the other move is Bishop to B4 check um after Bishop to be4 check this is a move that was developed by Anthony miles the idea is to provoke the pawn to go to C3 uh after which the bishop should go to C5 there are alternatives Bishop A5 and Bishop E7 but these are both uh mistakes if Bishop E7 then all we have to remember is that after Bishop D3 Knight F6 excuse me Bishop D3 Knight F6 castles castles white plays Bishop to F4 and this position is better for white because after D6 notice that D5 can't be played after D6 this our Bishop on D3 is better placed than the bishop on E7 and as a result we have the advantage so going back another alternative here is Bishop to A5 and uh here we simply play Knight C6 6 Pawn C6 and A4 and white is going to gain the initiative on the queen Side by attacking the bishop on A5 so going back uh if instead in this position black plays Bishop to C5 then we play Bishop to E3 and uh white black usually plays Queen F6 and here you could play the positional C3 which is very interesting or you could be adventurous and play Knight to B5 uh threatening the pawn on C7 and uh the only bad thing is that there is Health concern here and that's that our Pawn structure is completely wrecked but after Queen takes E4 Knight C7 Knight takes A8 Queen takes H1 the position is basically completely chaotic and the player that's better prepared is going to be the one that typically wins the game so if you like this position or if you like this quad opening you can study this carefully and you should outplay your opponents so going back that leaves us only with the main alternative which is Knight to have six and uh here after Knight takes C6 Pawn takes C6 what does white have what does black have black has absolute free development for his pieces and dynamic possibilities he has an open E file open open B file squares for his pieces he's doing okay white has the better structure with that said if black develops an initiative white should be inferior but if white uh is capable of developing his pieces he should be better because he has the better structure so let's see how that pans out typically white plays E5 here black will play Queen E7 Queen E2 now Knight to D5 here white usually play C4 and now uh it's a question about whether or not the bishop or the knight uh should be misplaced sometimes they play Knight B6 other times they play Bishop A6 typically Bishop Bishop A6 is played we play B3 and now black has two ways of playing he could play G6 or G5 if G6 white usually plays F4 and the plan is to play Queen to F2 Bishop to A3 and typically he gets a better game so as a result black started playing G5 and white would continue with G3 and we enter a variation where uh basically we play an end game where um there is equal chances for both sides but needless to say it's one of those positions where if you have more experience in it you should uh be able to score a full point given the fact that it's completely unbalanced"

slowly for this Tut I'm going to use just a regular um B pencil but you could use any kind of pencil you want and what I'm going to do is I'm going to create my horse just using some basic shapes so the first shape I'm going to use is a nice circle shape for the chest of the horse and then I'm going to bring in along the backbone so up here is where the the neck connects and there's the withers so you have the backbone which kind of does this really nice swoop curve you don't want to swoop it too much because it'll be kind of a sway back horse but a nice little swooping up and all the way to the back part of the horse which is going to be another um Circle which is going to be a nice rump shape and again I'm drawing really Loosely um so that I can change and move things around if I need to now the distance between these two circles is roughly a little over half um so and Depend and it also depends on the horse some horses are a little bit more narrow through here some are really really really long just depends on the breed and the more you draw the more you'll just kind of be comfortable with this be able to see the difference um and how much you want so if I were to put another Circle in there you'd see it would overlap a little bit in here and this part right here is um the chest the rib cage uh which we also call the barrel of the horse um this is where um all the rib bones are up through here it's really great when you're learning to draw um animals that you really understand how the bone structure and the muscle structure is called Drawing the anatomy um because it helps you understand what's going on be underneath the skin under what underneath what you can see and helps you to understand how things work and move and why things you know there's a bump here and a divot there um kind of see those things so I would really recommend getting some really good reference photos um some Anatomy pictures and taking a look at those so here is the main body of the horse so basically it's just three large circles here so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and create in now the legs of the horse and a good way to judge how long to make your legs is this is almost going to be a square so from here to here should be roughly around the same distance from here to here so I'm just going to draw some invisible lines down here these are not the legs obviously the legs don't come out way out here but this is just going to let me know how long to make this horse so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and put in my horse's legs and this actually starts all the way up here in the shoulders here's the shoulder blade of the horse here comes back down to here to kind of like their elbow and then down to their first knee and then their lower part of their leg and into their hoof or their ankle and I kind of just represent everything with a little bit of a circle there the upper part of the leg is a lot thicker than the lower part of the leg and you'll see I don't have this coming out right here I want the chest to kind of wrap in a little bit got some good muscles here so the top leg has a little bit more muscle than the bottom part of the leg is a lot I mean there's a little bit of muscle obviously but more tendons and a little bit thinner and narrower and all that I'm going to put the other back leg is just going to be set back just a little bit further and again just draw really Loosely so that it's easier for you to kind of erase and move things around a little bit and all that so now let's look at the back part of the legs and the back legs are going to start up right here with the hip and they're going to come down going I to the first kind of knee muscle here and it's going to go back to the back of the leg there's a joint there and then it comes down to the back hes right here and so there's a lot of muscle right here so in this part of the rump kind of wraps around and then just tapers along kind of follows that along there and then this muscle just comes really nice and tight then once it gets back to the kind of the back part of the leg again just like over here thins out a little bit over the ankle bone just like so okay once you have that leg then you can go ahead and bring in the other leg I'm going to bring this one in just a little bit forward so I'm going to bring this bone up here there's the back of the leg there and just the same thing so the underside of the horse the barrel of the horse um is not just this straight line you don't want this nice straight line you want it to kind of swoop down just a little bit kind of following this Contour of the circle here a little bit and it just wraps around and then kind of heads on up and into the flanks now we'll go ahead and put the neck in and the neck usually connects about if you go cut this a little under halfway so all along here is your backbone and your backbone runs all the way up through the neck so you just want a nice smooth transition there and however you want the horse's head to go it can be you know straight up or kind of curved down or you can have it bending down to graze so the horse's head I I achiev by drawing two circles a larger one for kind of the cheek of the horse and then a smaller one for the muzzle or mouth of the horse so now we have kind of just the basic outline of the horse built up and I have H videos on how to specifically draw ears and I have videos on how to draw horse Hooves and horse eyes and horse mans and all that so I will leave some links to those in the description box below for you for a little bit more detail on how to finalize these up but in this video I really want to show you how to build in the horse base which is this you know basic shape here before you get into all the really kind of fun detailing so what I'm going to do right now is I'm going to erase the lines I don't need and then finish up those details in time lapse for you so you can kind of see that um if you have any questions on specifically you know how do I do this part or that part um leave that in the comment section below or again check out the videos that I'll post in the description box and those might answer your questions there so I'll be back in just a minute to finish up this [Music] video so there we have a finished kind of blocked in base horse with all the guidelines removed and so now it's time to add in some detail and some shading but I'm going to go ahead and do that in the second video I had done a video previously of a horse how to draw a horse um I think it was my horse Galloping video and I had done a separate video on how to do the shading and promised everyone a video on how to shade a horse and then promptly deleted that footage so that's why that footage never video never came to be so sad so I'm going to do I'm going to do that with this video here I'm going to make a secondary video on how I shade this horse so if you're interested in uh finding out how I do that make sure to check in for the next video coming up in the meantime uh feel free to check out some of my other videos and have fun drawing and until next time God bless you guys and we'll see you later bye-bye"

        "transcript": "yo what up there it's me here again quick Cho and yeah we're going to have a little chat again today I'll be talking with you guys about well Modern Warfare as you can see and um the MSR this is the sniper that I'm using right now which you unlock at level 66 for the people that don't know about it yet um I've been actually ranking up and playing for getting this gun cuz I really liked it when I picked up picked it up a couple of times from teammates and and died enemies and um while playing with it I actually got a couple of kills and then eventually when I just unlocked it for myself played with it a couple of times I really liked it and um I think this is the best sniper so far uh except the M4 A3 from Call of Duty 4 and so that one is at place number one for me and the MSR is right underneath that and um that's just because of the nice drag you can do with it drag scoping is pretty nice um by the way what you can hear the background the guy talking all the all the [\u00a0__\u00a0] time that's uh that's my my friend actually in the party we had a conversation while recording this and I forgot about having the settings on both cuz probably most of you know most of you know if you go to uh pref or whatever on your Xbox and you put your uh voice to both it records the voice and the audio at the same time and that's what it done actually by accident this time so I'm sorry about that and it's it's a funny cuz at the end of the video you can actually hear him eat chips so yeah it was pretty funny um um anyway about the video is using the MSR I've got no Amos or no camos unlocked anything on it right now um I was going for the red tiger and I was going for the gold as well I'm pretty close now I I'm I'm at rank 30 but as I told you in my other video before which I will be posting underneath so you can see that if you didn't see that video yet and leave your like and and just watch that video as well um I talked about how how major long it takes to rank up from rank 30 to 31 to get your golden camo um I'm I've got the uh red tiger right now I'm I'm I'm busy with getting the golden on this on this MSR as well cuz I think the golden looks pretty cool on it uh before the the golden camo of course I like the red tiger the most uh the camo that's between the red tiger and the um what do you call it golden looks a bit like Urban kind of stuff but I don't really really like that it's like yellowish and I don't really like that one so I'm not using that too much um I'm apologizing for my voice by the way guys cuz I'll might be sniffing a couple of times cuz I've got a cold right now and it's it's it's seriously annoying and I think it's even more annoying for me than for you guys right now while you're watching the video cuz I'm the one who is having having pain um up up my noise strolls whatever you call that or like in my no nor I I can't even say that word but you know what I mean I'm the one who's having this [\u00a0__\u00a0] right now I feel I feel throwing the C4 there I got killed there um besides that I want to have a talk about my my personal life a bit cuz I talked with you guys about my uh intership whatever I think it was C like not intership cuz one guy told me before on my previous video um I'm doing intership right now for school and I'm working at some kind of of well it's actually a big store and um yeah they sell um a couple of animals couple of reptiles uh dog food cat food fish food uh fish tanks all kind of animal stuff and then they got another part of their shop which they sell um yeah trees and plans and that kind of crap so gardening stuff but I'm I'm I'm working at the uh animal part cuz I'm doing the I'm doing college right now as well to be uh to become a animal uh how do you call that actually in English um an animal trater like uh you know how to handle every animal and like feed them what they what they need like be specialized in in trading and having animals uh that's actually what I'm doing right now so I I have have to I have to go to intership for that as well two days a week so that's pretty busy I've got the uh what do you call it um a couple of things that I've got to make as well for school again wellbeing and the internship so um that takes some time as well but they actually really liked me out there so um uh after 6 days being there so that's like six or two that's three weeks being to intership um they actually asked me to come work over there so I've got a job right now as well which it will be at Wednesday night until 6:00 to 9:00 uh Dutch time and also um I'm going to be working at Friday Friday uh same time again from 6:00 to 9:00 so um I've got I'm pretty busy right now so I hope you guys uh yeah accept that and um support me in that as well um video's almost ended over here I just got out of my uh what do you call that thing again because it's not an a130 but it's something else I actually like this this thing more than an ac130 it's not as powerful but um if you aim right and you know how to handle it it's it's it's really be it can be effective if if you're really good you can actually make sure they go right into the windows and actually kill people who are inside so and you can shoot them way quicker after each other than the ac130 so that's that's just my opinion about this um I hope you guys like this game play I I liked it a lot while I was playing it and I watched it back and um I think I did pretty good with the quick scoping here so and I'm actually thinking about doing some more free thrs cuz free thr is actually the only game tab that I like right now to snipe cuz gr war is way to busy explosions everywhere gets killed all the [\u00a0__\u00a0] time which is way [\u00a0__\u00a0] annoying and that's why I just play freefor all a lot cuz you can just put your headset on listen around you know where they're coming from you can get nice kill feeds and stuff so I'm actually thinking about doing a little freefor for you guys failed on the no scope there for the kill cam but I hope you guys likeed it anyway uh please support me leave your like to this video uh comment below if you have any questions or you just want to say hi you can always comment of course and I will see you next time again so peace out take it easy and bye"

        "transcript": "welcome to a crash course in Trials Evolution gold now out for PC today we're going to take a look at different tricks and things they don't necessarily show you guys in the tutorials as well as take a look at the controls the actual controls on an Xbox 360 controller not much I could do for those of you guys on keyboards as a matter of fact I'm let you know that you're not going to be happy with the way the bike handles on Hills it's virtually impossible to do most Hills uh using the keyboard now the track we're using today has been specifically designed for this video by squishy you can go and try it yourself it's called tet's training on track Central now you've already seen half the obstacles let's go and go back to the beginning here's the controller and you can see everything that I'm doing I'm going to explain as much as I can I have a breakout video to show you guys that I recorded separately specifically for the fapping portion explain that in a bit well let's get start with the hill climb now there's no big secret to tackling these Hills all you have to do is just give it enough gas to go up without you know basically flipping over backwards you can approach these things a lot faster than what I'm showing you here try and actually stall it out here to kind of show off a little but here we go all you have to do is keep the bike from flipping over backwards and the best way to do that is by not hitting the brake just give it gas release the gas and I'm I'm talking very very small increments you get to the point where you can almost Hold Steady on these Hills and to show off or to catch yourself after you do a flip onto one by knock gunning it and giving it just a little bit of gas now what about those times when you accidentally get yourself stuck kind of halfway up just like this well first don't let go of the accelerator the second you release release that accelerator you will fall back with enough momentum to flip over backwards just keep yourself pushing forward slowly release the accelerator just enough to lean back just like this and then give yourself enough gas to pull yourself over it's easy this next obstacle is extremely common all you have to do is basically lean your Rider backwards going up the hill and then push forwards a second your wheel leaves the top of the ramp you're going to hook that right there and you can flip it over by simply holding down the accelerator do not let it go let's watch it one more time now you're going to want to pull back and then the second your wheel clears the top you push forward just like that once the wheel touches hold on to the accelerator and right to keep the bike moving in that direction once you get to a certain point right about here go ahead and tap the brake and then just do whatever you need to do to keep the thing leveled out is a very very common obstacle you're going to see it everywhere next up we have a bunny hop followed by a fap you should already know how to do a bunny hop from the a license test all you have to do is basically lean back and then once the try to get to a certain point push forward and then lean back really quick he'll lift the bike off the ground and you could clear an obstacle or whatever it is that you're trying to get over now while this isn't the obstacle design for this it's the best place to show you because a lot of times you're going to be in this situation you're end up crashing watch the controller carefully because this is the fap maneuver okay I'm going to actually show off a little bit too once I get well within distance to clear this notice that once I've reached a certain points the bike actually starts to kind of move forward mastering this skill will save your ass more time times than you you could ever possibly imagine so this is why I've actually created a separate segment showing just the controller so you guys can see what it is that you do to make this happen so let's take a look at the controller real quick and use this as kind of a use this as our as our bike basically so let's say we have a platform right here and there's a ramp like this okay so you're going to come up the ramp and then you're going to lean forward and you're going to hit it just like this in most cases you're going to hit it like this and if you don't do anything else it's just gonna go like this and he's gonna go like this you're gonna fall backwards you're gonna crash okay uh if you jump up and you hit the brake right when that front wheel hits you're going to have a little B bit of momentum here here and the bike's going to come up around just like this but it's not going to come all the way over with enough momentum to push you forward so you could go like this that's what you want to do ultimately unfortunately usually this is what ends up happening you go up you hit the break or something and then okay that's it then you go back and you crash okay so uh what you want to do is basically you're going to get to the top here right when the bike hits that front tire you hit that break right there what's going to happen is all that upward momentum is going to is going to convert into rotational speed because that front tire now becomes a pivot point and basically front tire hits it's locked in place it's could come up over here like this and then once you get to this point right here you're going to you're going to basically slow down the tap uh or the fap what do you want to call it and you're going to bring it out just you have to balance it using the left joystick so that's going to happen like that then it's going to hit and then you can go on about your business here's how it looks like on the controls you're going up and then at the very top you're going to push forward you're going to hit the break as soon as that front tire hits okay and when it does notice I'm using the x button not here because it's harder to go like this okay you try all these different fingers and whatever it's definitely easier just to go like this with the with your B button here or with the uh your thumb on the X here so once you plant that boom the back end is now flipping over and then you start to tap it really it's as soon as you pin it you start tapping like this cuz all that force is now is now rotating on the pivot Points so you just basically feed it like this once you get to a certain point you're going to have to start kind of lean back a little bit you kind of make small adjustments with your left thumb on the joystick still doing this as long as you do this okay this is where the fat thing comes from because originally I was doing it like this and you can imagine going like this someone's looking it's going to look bad okay so once you get that thing going as long as you keep this like just tapping like this you should be fine and you can actually hold it there for quite a while it's kind of a nice little showoff piece to do that is how you fap hill climbing Fender hooks bunny Hops and fapping these are just four things out of probably about 8 to 10 that we need to in this just one track but these are some of the most important and the most common so Master these and you'll have a much easier time on some of the harder tracks and some of the extreme tracks so stay tuned for more crash courses in Trials Evolution gold and remember Mike B taught you how to fap [Music]"

        "transcript": "[music] [music] [aircraft noise] The Jakobshavn Glacier on the west coast of Greenland. It\u2019s a familiar destination,  but it certainly looks different every year. Yesterday Operation IceBridge   returned to the glacier for the first time in 2013, repeating  a high priority mission they\u2019ve now flown for five consecutive years, and  and collected another trove of valuable data and some great images. What\u2019s so special about Jakobshavn that keeps IceBridge and other researchers coming back? Well, it\u2019s one of the fastest moving glaciers in Greenland, it produces more icebergs than any other northern glacier,  and over the past 150 years it\u2019s been retreating dramatically.  Studying how glaciers like Jakobshavn are changing from year-to-year  helps scientists get a handle on both the movement of the ice on a local scale,  and ultimately how much these glaciers might contribute to sea level rise. While studying the upstream catchment area of the glacier \u2013 kind of like the drainage basin of a river \u2013 was the primary objective  on yesterday\u2019s flight, making a pass over the calving front of the glacier is always  a highlight of the mission, as we can see from this video taken last year. Here we see two views  of the calving front from this year\u2026 with laser elevation data above \u2026  and high-resolution photographic data below. And here\u2019s a closer  look at just how detailed that imagery is. IceBridge plans to be back in Jakobshavn next year. Past, present and future IceBridge flights over regions like this one are aimed at building a continuous record of change in Earth's  polar regions to bridge the gap between NASA's ICESat satellite  and ICESat-2, scheduled for launch in 2016.

        "transcript": "as a real estate agent you work on the go and understand mobile productivity is crucial to your business that's why many tablets are ideal for you they're powerful lightweight sleek and portable but which one is best for your real estate needs to find out prowess Consulting put two mini tablets to the test the Dell Venue 8 and the Apple iPad Mini we simulated hands-on practical scenarios that agents encounter on a daily basis and discovered the Dell Venue 8 power by Intel is a smarter choice for real estate agents why because it delivers faster property searches easier file transferring cleaner document signing better photo editing and a more intuitive email experience this first demo shows what happens when we search for and map nearby properties using our local Multiple Listing Service as illustrated the intellivent-asv mas properties twice as fast as the iPad Mini with no mapping errors by mapping errors we mean glitches like this one on the iPad minis map see how the icon for this property disappears when i zoom in I have to zoom out for it to reappear so I can select it now watch the difference in time as each device pulls up the route map to the property the next noticeable perk of the Dell Venue 8 is its back a menu buttons that make it easy to transition between screens while comfortably holding the tablet with one hand in contrast the iPad requires me to rotate the orientation of the tablet and return to the main menu to switch between the map and the listing screen our second real estate demo involves transferring files between a tablet and the PC and retrieving files on the tablet the catch is no internet connection you ask why not just use cloud or email to backup files because an agent's constant mobility doesn't always guarantee a reliable connection and saving a file locally can be more secure and is free the Dell Venue 8 makes saving a local file almost too easy especially if you are one of the 83% of realtor's using a Windows operating system on your PC the Dell Venue 8 has two easy options for direct file transferring use the tablet as a USB Drive or use a microSD card both options require just a few clicks watch how quickly I can transfer my file from my desktop to the Dell Venue aids local Drive in just a few more seconds I can open the pocket cloud Explorer app on the Dell Venue 8 and retrieve that file in contrast the iPad USB Drive on the PC only pulls up images it does not let us create a new folder or save any files onto the PCs Drive and a microSD card is not an option either because the iPad doesn't have a microsd card slot when we open the pocket cloud file manager app on the iPad no content folders show up to sum it up the iPad doesn't deliver when it comes to transferring or retrieving files without a reliable internet connection demo number three is all about mobile productivity I am signing documents on the go using an app called DocuSign which I downloaded on both tablets let's start with the Dell Venue 8 I've loaded a real-estate purchase contract which is seven pages and requires an initial and date on every page I'll fast-forward through all the pages the final result is a clean document with no hang-ups or errors due to screen sensitivities now let's try it on the iPad Mini the signing goes fine until page 5 when scrolling with my thumb the screen picks up a tap and drops an initial randomly on the page I try deleting it when I tap the X another initial appears and another I have to zoom in to get the X to register my tap to delete the initial box these type of touch screen sensitivity errors also occurred in about 25% of our initial tests using DocuSign on the iPad our fourth demo covers one of the more artistic tasks of real-estate agents taking and editing property photos I'll highlight some of the differences between the tablets when it comes to photo ops first of all the venue 8 has 37 native photo editing tools and the iPad Mini has 14 secondly the Dell Venue 8 has better multitask ease with an always visible photo menu on the iPad Mini the editing task bar disappears when I want to make an edit and I have to click cancel in the corner to get back to the editing menu and finally the entire image being edited shows up on the video 8 at all times on the iPad the image is cut off on the top and the bottom when editing our last demo highlights the email experience on both tablets because gmail is the most used email client among realtor's agents get the benefit of using a tablet designed to work seamlessly smooth with Google software the venue 8's native Gmail app closely resembles the way Gmail runs on a PC or Android device the inbox screen shows the icons and sender images so you can quickly identify the sender also the message spans the whole width of the screen making it easier to preview and requires less scrolling the Gmail organization tabs appear here finally the Dell Venue 8 s keyboard comes setup for swiping so if you're used to that swipe away Gmail users will find the iPad email options are less familiar and not as user-friendly looking at the Gmail app on the iPad we see it has a narrow inbox column that requires a lot of scrolling through messages no sender icons or images show up like they did on the Dells Gmail app and less text appears in the email so it's harder to preview the message quickly overall the screen is more cluttered let's look at the native Apple email app that comes on the iPad it looks very similar with a narrow menu column no sender icons and busy screen as you can see sometimes it takes a few times to get the sliding menu screen to recognize my touch finally if you'd like to swipe the keyboard you're out of luck because the iPad doesn't come with swiping capability at the end of the day we've learned all tablets are not created equal the Dell Venue 8 powered by Intel is the smarter choice for real estate agents it's fast and responsive performance and practical workflow design enables you to get your business done with the Dell Venue 8 in your back pocket you get an extra boost of mobile productivity getting more done no matter where you work so seal the deal with the right tablet the Dell Venue 8 to read the complete report a prowess Consulting's real estate tablet study visit this URL you"

        "transcript": "[Music] hi this is James from tracy.com and we're taking a look at the new BlackBerry Q10 uh the latest black 10 smartphone uh this one comes after the Z10 that we OB had released at the end of January but now we get one with a a full qu keyboard so let's just have a quick look around the device over on the left hand side we've got our micro USB port and we've also got a HDMI out which is very nice on the opposite side we've got our volume controls and uh these also um control the the media features you can play in PS and uh skip tracks that sort of thing over on the top we've got our 3 and 1/2 mil Jack and we've got our uh our power button for turning the the phone on and off uh there's a speaker on the bottom and a microphone and then over on the back we've got our uh our 8 megapixel camera lens camera Flash and uh obviously we've got the nice uh shiny blackbery logo and the beauty with Blackberry 10 smartphones is they have removable batteries so uh SIM card goes in there uh memory card goes in there all slots together very nicely and obiously at the uh on the front we've obviously got the uh the the nice new uh uh quer keyboard uh We've also got um our front-facing camera at the top speaker Grill proximity senters that sort of thing um and yeah I mean software wise it's it's it's more or less identical to on the Z 10 obviously we lose a little bit of screen real estate but uh one of the nice things about uh the Z 10 is we actually get an AMOLED screen which is the uh the the first AMOLED screen that black PR produced and to sort of utilize battery life on this they've implemented some dark themes so we've got one here on uh on on uh blackbery messenger so the 10 this is this is white um but it's uh very much black here uh the same applies for the calendar that's also got a uh a black theme and adding new entries uh just in case of uh typing it in and pressing save and there we go um looking around some of the uh applications um that we get with the device I actually uh I've actually side loaded a few here but the uh the browser we'll take a quick look at that we'll just do a search and that's uh using Bing by default but I can change that if I want to and as you can see it's nice and quick now the beauty with blackb 10 is if we select an article that we want to read we can also then dive into the menu and go to reader mode so we can read the article without having to uh scroll in and out that sort of thing so that's pretty sweet browser on blackb 10 is fantastic and just as good on the uh on the Z1 as you can see there we've also got Skype supported so we can make Skype phone calls and video calls and it works absolutely beautifully um blackbery world again much the same as we've seen on the Z1 so we've got lots of different selections and obviously we can also um buy movies and uh and music music from uh from from black the world now um media we've obviously got pictures video music I don't think I've got much on here actually um all none that I can show you anyway personal stuff uh Twitter and Facebook come preloaded on there of obviously um WhatsApp doesn't but that's downloadable from uh blackbery world um LinkedIn that is uh an at application we've got the uh clock calculator and the clock gets a slightly different uh theme as well compared to the uh uh I say the actual clock doesn't but the timer that gets a slightly different uh theme but the lovely way if you turn the timer on it's just a case of uh sliding this round to what time you want the the actual alarm to go off pretty sweet what else have we got uh Instagram that's uh um that's actually the Android version that I've side loaded on as you can see here with GPS uh you can create folders uh we've got Google Talk there blackb travels always nice to see um we've got the um Sky Loop supported with a lot of games so we've got games here so we can see what our friends have been playing and how good they've been doing at the games uh obviously we've got docs to go so you've got full uh Word and Excel camera is 8 megapixel and it does a pretty good job let's uh take a photo of my mouse so but obviously we've got some options there and obviously as well as having the uh video camera we've oops we've got the time scape as well so that's used for taking photos of uh move move in items and then you can sort of move back and forth if I was taking pictures of people they'd uh they' have separate face detection and uh you can change each face which is cool what else have we got um all fairly standard stuff but the beauty of this is that whatever app you're in again you can peek and you can peek and see your notifications and then jumping into the Hub and uh you've got all your different uh um accounts so we've got BBM text messages various email accounts we've got Facebook Twitter LinkedIn phone calls voicemail and pin messaging all integrated into the Hub uh you can view them separately if you want to like so but it's I always leave mine on the Hub and then you just got a nice big list of uh of everything there so the Q10 seems to be doing a fantastic job uh it looks great it feels absolutely great in the hand the back covers um it's kind of like a carbon it's not too slippery but it's not too rough uh it feels absolutely wonderful so I think this one is actually going to be a huge seller for uh uh for for Blackberry and it wouldn't surprise me if this actually take uh overtake sales of the uh Blackberry set 10 so that's just a quick look the uh Q10 um you can pick this one up at uh most networks now or you can get it Sim free uh at various locations including expenses I'm out of here bye"

        "transcript": "hey guys so I apologize if I don't look or seem my best but I'm not feeling too well today but I really wanted to record a video so I mean I had the motivation just not the physical strength to make an effort to look nice my friend Robin tagged me in the rainbow products tag and this is going to be entirely beauty products not clothing items even though I know you can mix because I kind of wanted to do a whole another video like a rainbow lookbook type thing hopefully in the future for red I have here the Lucas po out ointment which is Australian I believe um and it's basically like just an ointment everyone's favorite word it's like a really thick balm and I love using it you can use it on burns Cuts anything it's like a organic um natural NEOS sporn if you know that is and yeah I use this a ton I use it a lot when I burn myself which I mean most people that's probably not a common occurrence but if you ever lived in my flat in London you get burned nearly daily on our oven so I'm use that a lot also if I ever get burned on like a curling iron or curling wand which is what I have this stuff is good I like it for orange I was going to do my favorite orange lipstick at the moment but I think I'm going to save that for my monthly favorites and talk about something a little different and that is this Orange um eyeliner actually it's a waterproof and smudge proof eyeliner which is going to be a lot really weird but because I dyed my hair brown even though it looks really red today um cuz the red really comes out in the light and there's sunlight coming through but uh with dark hair or with red hair I never could wear orange products really I didn't like how it clashed so now that I have brown hair I've been wearing a lot of orange on my lips on my nails clothes and I thought it'd be cool to play around with eyeliner cuz you see it a lot in like nylon magazine they just put um on the upper lash line they do like orange cat eye and I always thought that was so cool and I've been having so much fun with this and um yeah maybe I'll do a look or something with it at some point oh by the way this is I didn't even say what product it is it is the Ula liner from sleek and it's really good it's really smooth and goes on nicely I like it a lot next is yellow and I have here this looks green but the product itself is pretty greeny yellow and it is the antipodes grape seed butter cleanser um and it's a face cleanser with like cocoa butter hibiscus flour um and yeah this company I'm obsessed with they're from New Zealand apparently the cast of The Hobbit was using antibes products which I think is pretty awesome this is the cleanser I use at night and it it leaves your skin feeling really like buttery um and I mean it takes a while to sink in is I guess what I'm saying because of the cocoa butter it like stays on top of your skin which is why I like it at night time because you go to bed with your skin like feeling soft and it will sink in overnight and be really nice um I have dry skin so that is a product a good good thing in products for me speaking is hard I might do a skincare video eventually for for green I have the Keras resistance um fiber architect this stuff um I it's like such a long title and not in language that to speak but basically it's a dual serum like you can kind of see here the green and the clear white it's a dual serum for dry hair which I have this isn't like my hair has um since change dyeing it and cutting it it's been a lot healthier but back when I had really dry hair and like really hard to manage hair this stuff saved me and I think it's a great product I know there are a lot of people out there with really dry hair so I definitely recommend this it's slightly on the pricier side but I think I found it cheap online somewhere like cheaper than at a hair salon for blue I have something I've talked about on this channel but it is one of my favorite nail polishes of this year and it's um Nails Inc Baker Street and it's just really fun it's like a cold belt blue I've talked about it before um I don't really have much to say about it but it's blue purple I have here the pro eye makeup remover from Mac this is the sample size and it's my favorite eye makeup remover I use waterproof mascara because I have really watery eyes so like if I look into the I just looked into the light and my eyes started watering very sensitive eyes so this stuff works great on waterproof mascara everything I guess that should have been Violet and before that I have Indigo this is kind of indigo what is a rainbow I don't know anyway this is kind of indigo on the top maybe I don't know Neil zered remedies is a company that I really like and I have quite a few products from them I don't use all of the products I have because some of them I found don't work for me but this is one that I quite like I don't use it daily but it's really nice for if you want a thin it's quite watery moisturizer I didn't even see what it was I'm terrible I'm a terrible makeup person this is the power Berry daily moisture um cleans or uh moisturizer for and it protects youthful skin I remember reading about it online and stuff and it's for people who live in the city and have like a very busy life and all like City air and I don't know it's good for your skin if you live in the city is what I read it's quite thin I'll kind of do a little demonstration uh here you can kind of see it there quite like dewy and thin and it sinks in quickly very strong smell of goji berry um so if you don't dig strong smells this has one but I I have very sensitive skin and it's never been irritating for me pink is one that they've added on for the tag and this is pretty pink and it is the Victor and Ralf flower balm love this perfume this is like I got this for Christmas and this is the fastest I've ever gone through a perfume I still have loads in there but you know that's a lot less than it was when I got it so yeah this smells amazing you might have already smelled this before I'm not going to try and explain the scent but it's very sweet and um it's slight floral but it's more sweet to me and it's so nice it's it it stays on for a little while my mom who hates all perfume likes it and finally multicolor and I realized I have very few multicolored products so uh I used a palette and I still don't even have that many palettes with colors most of my palettes are neutral but I have this old Urban Decay palette I'm not sure if this they still sell this but I'll link a Urban Decay palette with similar colors down below if they don't um I don't even know the name of it there's no name on here say but uh it's this it has all these colors I like using um Ransom which is like the bright purple and piece which is like a bright blue and um graffiti is like a Cobalt bright green which is nice and also fishnet which is the pinky purple color those are the main ones I use in this palette because I use it for bright colors that's all for me today apologies for like being spy and whatnot but I do have a request for you guys if you could put video requests down in the comments um don't write lookbooks because I do want to record my lookbooks and I I would if I could but they're really hard to do on my own and I don't currently like have access to people who will help me film a YouTube video where it's just like me talking about my clothes or PE like posing because it's kind of awkward to have someone who doesn't know YouTube stuff have like help you film that sort of thing also no one of my family knows how to use my camera it's just a a mess So eventually I will um as soon as I get people who can help me with that I'd love to do more lookbooks books because they're my favorite videos to film and edit and all that but um other than that let me know what kind of videos you want to see I do want to do like skincare every day makeup video and I think I will do those soon but let me know if you want any others and I'll see you guys next time [Music]"

        "transcript": "hi guys uh welcome to the quick unboxing and a short review of the airtime Picassa phone so I've bought this phone from eBay for 3,700 rupe whereas uh the box shows something else it shows 7,499 you can get this phone from uh e-commerce sites like home shop 18 or India times for almost 4,000 rupees got this an offer for approximately 37 but you may not find it for the same price I'm quickly opening the box and uh have a c quick view on the phone over all I've I've used this phone for 2 days before you know I could do this review there's also a screen guard provided in this box there's one more box inside this inside which you have the manual you have a charger earphone so the earphone does not look very great but it should just meet your requirements so I'll I'll keep all these things aside and turn this phone on I have mentioned that I've been using this phone for a couple of days before I could do do this review because uh while I was unboxing it for the first time that this this did not turn on and I had to keep it on charging for some time so don't be surprised if you get it in a box and the phone does not turn on just connect it to a charger for 10 to 15 15 minutes and it should turn on uh so here is how the phone looks let us go through the EXT in the beginning so this is a 3.5 in display and you have a front camera you have a home key uh on the front and it looks like a typical uh HTC phone I've also seen a few alil models like this so to the left you have the charg uh Port uh or the data transfer port on the top you have the power on off button and the 3.5 mm Jack to the right you have a dedicated camera key which is good and the volume rockus to the bottom you have the mic at the back you have the 5 megap camera and which is autofocus and the good thing is you also get a flash on this phone so for the approximate price of 4,000 you're getting a lot of features in this phone once I turn it on this is how the the display of the phone is and on on the basis of what I've been using for the last two days notice that the display is not too great it is a 320x 400 resolution display so it is quite obvious that the colors won't look good and the brightness of the display 2 isn't that great but considering the price range you shouldn't have any complaints the other fact the other specifications of this phone are it has got a 650 MHz processor you have a, 1450 mamp battery uh it has Wi-Fi Wi-Fi the ring hotspot and Bluetooth 2.1 you also have gpsd sensors and proximity sensors in this phone and let us quickly do some browsing on this phone I've I've already tried using the camera and the camera samples are comparatively okay to what you usually get in uh 5 megapix so let me quickly connect to Wi-Fi and do some quick browser meanwhile when the Wi-Fi gets connected I would say that this is a dual SIM phone and as you see you would find two Network signals over here I've been using an a airell 3G Sim and the Reliance Sim so I was able to make video calls the front camera isn't good enough for self-portraits as well but it should just meet your purpose if you want to make some native video calls I've tried installing Skype uh but as usual you know due to the low end processor I couldn't make any video calls in this uh but Tango looks okay you should be able to make video calls through Tango so let me quickly connect to so before doing some browsing uh I want to show you the operating system so this phone is Android 2.3.5 which is uh kind of going to be outdated in a couple of months but still for the price range it it is highly acceptable so let me try to uh browse the website here as you see the resolution of the display is quite low you don't get any saturated colors it it looks pretty dull uh but having said that you know this the interface is quite smooth I don't see any lag while using this device last two days I had uh couple of instances where it took some time for me to receive phone calls uh the screen did not uh the screen did not respond immediately but apart from that most of the times it has been quite good so it is taking some time to load the website but uh is still okay because of the lowend processor it there there might be a bit of lag but you see this is a capacitive screen multi-touch screen and it is not the best but still it is okay considering the price range it do takes a little bit of time to load web pages but is absolutely fine if uh you are a person who simply use it for day-to-day usage for phone calls for occasional snaps for occasional browsing with GPS and especially Android operating system within a price range of 4,000 then the device is definitely worth it and especially the camera autofocus 5 map with flash also makes it a worth so this is all about the phone do let me know if you have any queries about it so for a mid-range phone if you are wanting someone to gift or to use it as a additional phone day-to-day usage then I think they should absolutely meet the purpose uh do let me know any of your queries through the comments on this page and I should be able to answer you uh last but not the least on the battery the batter is quite good as I've been using it since 2 days and still the battery let me quickly show you I haven't installed the battery application but you see it's almost uh you have 50% of power left so I think on uh normal usage you should get approximately 3 days of uh 3 days of usage so which is quite good for the price of this phone so do let me know in case you have any queries and I shall respond you at the earliest opportunity thanks guys thanks for your time have a good day bye-bye"

smaller Man Down work the body don't pull your jab if you have one weakness Joey is that you pull your jab instead of using it with authority Warner may not hurt you but he will still score move laterally for Warner ables the biggest puncher you ever face use your size be hard to hit get in and get out don't stay inside make able go into the later rounds right here in the early goings uh the two heavyweights tussling a little bit Abel coming around with that powerful right hand fellas we talked about Leon Warner's Game Plan before the fight he told me watch for the faints he's going to faint all night long he's going to fake a punch then he's going to come in he says Abel has no jab and I will exploit that boy Warner just just took a really really big straight left hand by Joey and and and I'm really surprised that he took it as easily as he did Joey a lot of power 15 wins one loss and 15 Knockouts one his last six fights since that loss six by knockout right here at the Blue Horizon uh was against Aaron Lions who we saw last time here at the blue which serves notice as a great twist Leon Warner beat Dave brunett who in turn beat Aaron Lions a round robin if you will Philadelphia style and Abel comes over with that vicious left guys we've seen fights with some cruiserweights disguised as heavyweights these guys are true heavyweights oh absolutely and and that's the one the the one thing I was just going to say there's no mistaking that this is two heavyweights fighting in able hanging Warner around Warner should not be in that corner he's asking for trouble he felt his power Here Comes able Warner's hurt Warner is hurt he got he just he just got tagged by that straight left hand and he I don't think he's ever felt anything like that in his life Joey Abel coming in like the Minnesota Express just driving right through Levon Warner well Joey AEL a defensive line and this fight is over Joey AEL s Leon corner all the way to Center City with that punch and this fight is going to be over he does not know where oh the ref is the ref is going to let this let go I I I can't believe they're letting this go unbelievable Warner has no idea where he is he's gone somebody help him the doctor needs to come in and my God the power of we able my goodness gracious well we talked about it earlier guys he has power that is classic heavyweight power you can't teach it you either have it or you don't and he has it two words fellas as advertised oh absolutely absolutely and Manny is making a base here in Philadelphia Dean when he does stuff like that he's very flat-footed he just comes out and he just knocks people out and that is amazing cuz we both know that Levon Warner has a chin boxing fans love Knockouts let's take a look at this knockout again unbelievable watch Joey AEL here he faints a little bit to the right and then comes in has him shoots a straight left hand and and right there I mean he just done he's out right there and what I'm totally shocked at is that the referee allowed this fight to go any further than this right now leevon wer has absolutely no idea where he is he gets to his feet the ref is counting it in but it's just he's done he the lights are on but there's nobody home [Applause] well uh you know fans love Knockouts and here at the Blue Horizon these Philly fans live for Knockouts and I'll tell you that is why Joey AEL has become such a fan favorite here in Philly and uh I'll tell you he is he is on his way he sure is on his way that Joey able absolutely 6'5 former defensive end look at his left hand that he lands right there it's just unbelievable the ref has to step in at this point he actually has to pull W's leg out from under [Applause] [Music] him Joey Abel my goodness gracious me what power from the former defensive end from South Dakota State absolutely South Dakota State All Conference three years in a row defensive [Music] end and now Joey Abel is off to Sweden he's going to go over to Sweden and he's going to fight over there it's going to be the second time that he fought over there Joey AEL is of Swedish uh descent and we're going to go up to the ring to the Iceman Mike and Dean I'm here with the Victorious Joey AEL Joey you moved to 16- one with a thunderous knockout please take me through those two knockdowns uh I was waiting for the right shot I didn't want to like I said I've been trying to get control of my punches you know knowing where they're going to land instead just throwing them and Hing hoping they land at the right spot I knew where I was Landing I knew I was throwing at us y he's never been down before I didn't know what kind of a punch he could take and you know the F the first time I thought I was going to knock him out he went down so he said he was going to capitalize on what he thought was your ineffective jab what would did his faints at all surprise you or confuse you at all in that first round no I even though I went a couple minutes I I I didn't think I was I didn't think um his jab didn't bother me much at all I was more concerned about why you know throwing my job a little bit more but that that would have came if he would have went down um that would have came the second third fourth round Joey what's up next for you I'm going to Sweden next week um to fight uh I'm not sure how many rounds or whatever going the weekend after he's going to Wayne's cabin because he promises yeah and then I'm going to go to my my manager's cabin because he promised me well congratulations Joey the Blue Horizon loves you 16 and one congratulations Joey oh [Music]"

all cooked and if you don't like the raw onion you can just pre-cook and then add it on it's ready to eat ready i'm going to turn this one off oh amen yeah okay let's move to the next recipe okay the next one is going to be walnut muffins that's right and for the walnut muffins you will need one and a half cup of whole wheat flour one cup of chopped walnuts one cup of unbleached white flour half a cup of lettuce and granules one tablespoon energy baking powder one and one half teaspoon sea salt 1 teaspoon coriander 3 4 cup turbinado sugar 2 cups of water 1 tablespoon of vanilla extra chopped walnuts it's another energy food called walnut muffins wow so i will show you step by step and this is another awesome recipe this is that you can take it with you wherever you go wherever you go and then freeze through your go so first you will need one and a half cup whole wheat flour like earlier i mentioned about i'll use a spoon mention about how wholesome it is very high in fiber and because of they will cleanse your colon sure yeah this is the king of the whole grain it is is it yes okay high in fiber cleans colon wow everything and this is a walnut chop and we talked about walnuts earlier yeah very good for you you know we have to hear at least 20 times remember my case i have to hear about 50 times remember because i am hearing in another language i'm actually i'm from korea so i have to say to myself over and over and over so very nice really good for your brain yes at least maybe you can remember that and the lower your cholesterol so good for your heart and prevent your cancers wonderful helps for depression and everything right and this is um bleachy white flour the reason i am not using a 100 percent whole wheat flour for this recipe because it will be heavy muffin and nobody like the heavy muffin yeah so i'm adding some ombre white flour then lassiting grainier this is from the soy bean wow and lady you want to share something about resting grain yeah less than granule just it's a good artery cleaner dude a friend of ours he uses a lot and his arteries he's like 83 years old he's his arteries are crystal clear and it's amazing that he's takes like a tablespoon every day and they had a test done and his arteries are crystal clear so how many and also this stuff it tastes like a buttery tape give you a buttery taste if you put it in your mashed potatoes or whatever brings out the buttery flavor in it so it's very very good for you but the brighter that he was and vegan diet yeah vegan sure yes and the exercise that's part of it so exercise and i'm adding coriander oh yeah i need to put some energy baking powder okay and there's no baking soda no no aluminum no aluminium the healthiest one you can find there's a sea salt okay and this is a tabernacle sugar which is you can see that how brown it is you had a lot of molasses in here then i'm going to go ahead and mix it really good with all the dry ingredients okay this is such a delicious recipe yes it is and it looks really good too but since we are using a energy baking powder they are not really rice very high okay after they're very fulfilling and when you eat them you can eat one or e2 and it's wow you're full almost this is the water and the vanilla okay and then i'm going to mix one more time and i ask it to go and turn over at 350 350 degrees yes 350. yes 350. for 35 minutes it's about 35 minutes but you have to put it in the muffin bin team first time yes okay all right smells good though okay mixing is almost done very healthy healthy muffins and also give it a lot of energy all right and i'm gonna spray it will make about 12 muffins about 12. okay so i will go ahead put it all in here okay looks good didn't you have some muffin this money sure did for breakfast it was it was very good yeah and it keep us really full keep you full all day long it gives you that energy you're like a larry you got so much energy when you go to someone's house to help them out they're just amazed and you're like they call your energizer they're going and going and going they say aren't you tired of this you said no i had a good breakfast right good breakfast and a good day good lunch how do you do that i said i'm just i'm a vegan vegetarian that's right and when your blood is clear i mean that you're usually healthy person plus you need to have okay let

        "transcript": "Probably not, Michael Gray, and I'm gonna\ntell you why. It's because I don't really plan on speeding\nthrough the levels of Mario 2 like you apparently do. I actually really just want to be able to\nshow off the levels of Mario 2 to our wide audience. And I... I don't feel I'll be able to do that if I'm\njust... you know, skipping everything like you were. I'm actually going to play through the levels\nas they're meant to be played. Hello everyone! Once again, Paul Franzen the Editor-in-Chief of GameCola.net. Here we are playing Super Mario Bros. 2 for\nthe NES and I'm playing Level 1-3 which is actually the third and final... final level\nof World 1. Somehow, I got stuck fighting the boss. But I actually think the boss in this level\nis kinda fun, so it's ok. It's not like, uh, what is it, the crab monster\nlater in the game? Not... not a fan of the crab monster. This guy's pretty sweet though. It's a guy named \"Mouser,\" who... uh... Oh no! Oh no! Oh, phew. Who you may remember from the Super\nMario Bros. cartoon, actually. He made several appearances there. He had much... much more of a personality\nin the cartoon. Actually, all the characters in the cartoon\nhad much more of a personality in the cartoon than in the game. Over here, real quick I just want to show\nyou that um... if you brought that potion that I used back there... if you brought it\nover here, you can use it to go down this pipe and skip levels. Michael probably would have been doing that\nif he was playing this level, but I'm gonna just keep going. Also, Egger - \"E-G-G-E-R\" - I was saying Egger\nnot \"Egghead.\" Ok, that's enough sniping at Michael for one\nvideo, I have a feeling that's going to get annoying pretty quickly. So let's just keep talking about Mario 2 here. Pretty sweet game. Uh, as I mentioned in my first video, I like\nplaying as Toad because I think he's the best. Used to be a big fan of Luigi 'cause of his\ncrazy legs jump but uh... I really now have a much greater appreciation\nfor the speed of Toad. I find it much easier to uh... navigate levels\nwhile I'm using him, and it's a lot easier to pick things up and pick them up fast. Especially after you use the potion and you\nneed to grab all the vegetables in order to get coins. You're able to get more of those coins when\nyou're Toad 'cause he just picks things up a lot faster than all the other characters. And the reason you want to pick up those coins\n- by the way - is because uh, you've probably seen at the end of the last two videos, uh...a\nroulette... not a roulette a... kind of a slot machine mini-game. You get one entry into the slot machine per\ncoin that you pick up in that crazy potion land. And in the slot machine you can use those\nto try to win extra lives which are helpful. Obviously. You see that I'm really taking my time in\nthis level, but that's not because I can't speedrun through it. That's just because I choose to. And here we are: Mouser. First real boss of the game after Egger who\nis just kind of a mini-boss. A \"mid-boss,\" if you will. And this guy you have to beat by catching\nhis bombs and throwing them up onto this platform to blow him up. You can catch them in the air, or you can\ntry to pick them up afterwords. After they land. That's not as easy though because they're\nabout to explode when they're on the ground. Whereas, when it's still in the air you have\na lot more time to do something with them. You can see that the timing is... the timing\nis kind of tricky here since he keeps moving. So obviously very tricky or else I would have\ndone it by now. Still not as tricky as that friggin' crab\nmonster though. There we go! All the bombs disappear and a mysterious door\nto the second world opens. And that's where I'm leaving off. Take it away Michael!"

        "transcript": "what's up everybody once's again my name is man and welcome back to let's play Donkey Kong C of returns 3D in last episode 58 munching Marathon this episode we're going down to 5-k blast and bounce that is surprisingly an accurate description of this level before I start I'm going to equip two balloons and one banana juice this K level is actually fairly difficult so I'm going to get myself these extra handicaps just so we can sort of collect all these puzzle pieces with these and hopefully just Breeze through this level it's a good thing there's no penalty for like using these handy caps at all otherwise that would really really stink and then I would like not want to and like you saw to get that puzzle piece you got to make sure you have enough momentum to hover or just jump over the first Barrel there and land on top of it if you're having trouble with it try roll jumping before you start jumping over those first three enemies that usually works and um you guys saw nothing right there that totally didn't just happen I mean I didn't just blow one of my balloons on an easy Barrel blasting segment that I've done like a million times before without trouble so yeah that that didn't happen at all didn't make any mistakes there just erase that from your memory and nothing happened all right now that we're clear we can move on and grab ourself that second puzzle piece now right over here what you're going to want to do is just hold left literally that's all you have to do in that seg is just hold left that's pretty much all you have to do in any like 2D platform anyways that's like the best advice I could probably give you just hold left and you'll beat the game eventually but yeah like if you try to um Center out your jumps there you're not going to have enough momentum and you're just going to die it's fortunate and I've done that many times before right over here high bounce and you'll grab yourself that third puzzle piece again holding left let's just get through this level now there's a puzzle piece coming up where um it's right over here actually you kind of like time your jump to land like right over one of these spike traps and I did not do it there but if you do do it it looks pretty cool and you avoid taking damage thank goodness for that banana juice but I do want to save that banana juice I'm going to try and go through this part by throwing the needle and not getting hit at all and what do you know we actually did it sweet that area can be kind of tricky so you know whatever this next part though this next part plays mind games with you man at first you only get this one Spike en and you're like all right whatever the timing on this not that bad it's pretty easy you know then you get two and it's like oh well I mean it isn't like that bad right well it actually is a lot harder than it looks your mind sort of plays a trick on you you and it's like the two things moving at opposite directions at opposite times sort of messes with you it's kind of hard to get through there without taking a hit but like if you understand the trick that they're trying to pull on you you can get through there with taking minimal damage I took it there but you know what it doesn't really matter all right we're coming up on the last puzzle piece actually and then after that well we're pretty much golden for the rest of level we only have like Barrel blasting segments left so at this last puzzle pieza all you got to do is uh blast out on the top of this uh little like Barrel killer thing and once you get it you're good to go pretty much all right so all that's left to do is just blast through these barrels this next part is a really really cool like segment you got a ton of barrels just like spinning on these tracks back and forth you got to make sure you shoot into the next one at like the right time otherwise you'll like miss it and junk like that um a good tip to remember is that like when you shoot yourself out of a barrel you kind of like go forward indefinitely so if you shoot yourself a little bit early chances are you'll always land in the next Barrel because it's moving sort of where you're going to be so you got to like lead your shots a little bit if you do that you should be able to get through this part um pretty easily but just take your time there's no rush at all and all you got to do is get this last Barrel they give you a lot of time to get this one cuz they sort of like angle yourself correctly like 2 or 3 seconds before you actually need to shoot yourself anyways though we just completed level we got ourselves this lovely little yellow Pearl isn't that just nice that K level wasn't too bad I mean the handicaps certainly helped out so I'm not going to say that it was pure Skillet it definitely was a benefit to have that banana juice and those extra bananas or balloons rather anyways if you enjoy this episode a like R would be greatly appreciated if you want to see more consider subscribing but once again my name is man thank you so much for watching and I'll catch you in the next one"

        "transcript": "hi so for a very long time I've been thinking about stretching my ears U my ears are a bit red right now I don't really know why it just get red very fast and it's very weird but anyway today I finally decided to actually stretch my ears I've been thinking about doing that for like two years or something so yeah today I'm finally going to do it so I bought this 2 mm taper because you have to start with uh stretching your ears with a very small size I try to stretch my ears with with a 1.6 taper ones but that didn't really work out because it just slipped right through and it didn't really have any function so today I'm going to do it with a 2 mm taper so a taper is not supposed to be used as a jewelry even though it does have these little rings on it uh you're actually just supposed to use it as a stretching utensil thingy so after this you're supposed to put jewelry in because this won't give a even weight distribution uh so that's why I only bought one taper and that's also why I bought these little tunnels so yeah they just look like that they're very small so I won't stretch my ears like very big I think I'm going to go to like a three or 4 mm I don't think I'm going to go very big so yeah and then also as a lubricate I bought this Vitamin E oil I know that lots of people use Vaseline for this but you're really not supposed to do that because Vaseline locks in bacteria so then you will get infections and stuff probably uh the same thing with if you will use this as a jewelry you can also get infections so don't do that it's very bad for you so I cleaned my hands I cleaned the jewelry and I cleaned my ears so yeah right now I'm just going to start with stretching my ears so I'm going to take off the little rings of the taper and first I'm going to make my ears like oily and stuff so that the taper will go through more easily yeah so I will do that to both of my ears but I'm going to start with one ear then do the other ear and I will put it on this going to gently slowly push it through cuz we don't want a blowout so you have to be uh very gentle and everything push it through very slowly it hurts a little bit kind of stings it's burning a bit but not too much actually it's not too bad but it's not very pleasant either so it's almost true it wasn't too bad there we have it oh my ears very red but it's just because of me yeah so I'm going to take the jewelry if I can uh get it open or whatever I really can't talk to I'm really sorry just twist this thing off and then get it on here my hands are very slippery because of the oil I'm so good at this then we put this through if I can get this to work yeah there we have it okay it's in now so I'll screw this on it's very hard to see like I have to look in my mirror but also I have to make sure that you can see this on my viewfinder but yeah there you have it uh this earring is a very weird because they place it wrong when I got it so that's why it looks a bit weird and yeah right now I'm going to do the other side it didn't take as long as I thought it would it went through pretty easily so I think I'm just going to do the other side on camera too why not so going to make it all oily with the vitamin E oil get the taper and put it in my ear I don't know if this will go through as easily as well very slowly because that's an important thing it's getting pretty dark outside and it's also kind of storming and stuff so I hope that the lighting is okay it's kind of stinging a bit get it [Music] through yeah this one hurts a bit more it's still okay though and there we go okay get the other tunnel I'm actually surprised that they make tunnels this small actually has like a little little hole and stuff that that you uh can look through you can even see that okay uh I got it off so now we're going to put it on here take this thing out right here and it goes there screw it is on and then we're pretty much done [Music] so yeah is it on yes it is and that is what it looks like this one looks a bit less weird because this earring is actually placed correctly and this one isn't so that's why it looks so weird and my ears are still red but but uh yeah this was me stretching my ears for the first time now they're 2 mm and I don't know which size there will be next time I think 3 mm probably but I won't go very very big so there won't be a lot of stretching videos of mine but the next time when I stretch my ears I think I will make a video about it so yeah I hope that you enjoyed watching this video and thank you so much for watching this video yeah I'll hopefully see you later in my next video have a nice day bye"

        "transcript": "need FIFA coins check out the fifas shop. co.uk what's up guys and welcome to today's video we have got a little bit of a tip actually um as you guys know recently the web app and the mobile app for ultimate team has actually been kind of taken down by EA whilst they do a bit of Maintenance and uh this has kind of opened the door for trading to be you know come back into play to be fair and obviously it can only be done on the console because you know the transfer market on the web app and also the mobile app are down so we kind of gone and ring Back The Years a little bit um back to you know how I used to make my coins in FIFA 12 and FIFA 11 and FIFA 10 and that was by the 59th minute method now this is actually tried and tested um earlier today you'll see on the screen right now I put up a Lucas the right wing for play PSG for 400 coins and it actually took 50 seconds for that player to sell that's mad that is stupid um and I was amazed it wasn't picked up in seconds and it kind of came to me if this if if if I listed a 400 coin Lucas and it didn't get bought in 50 seconds then there's a lot of people that could actually be on that transfer market and make some serious coins like some serious coins you know obviously have to be lucky with certain deals being added um up to the market but at the moment the transfer market is so messed up that is the ability to make coins but also ability to lose coins so if I would recommend that you did this um I would have to say before you do it you have to check the the market and the value of the players because all the websites which are telling you the current prices of players are definitely wrong at the moment because they use the web app to kind of gauge all the prices um so they're inaccurate at the moment unless you know one that actually does it by the console I don't think you can do it by the console then um only take it off that but for example Sanchez is like 3.5 million for his 87 in form and he's actually 1.5 million on Xbox and you know that is an obviously that's obviously a wrong price so I don't you guys to lose coins but all I'm saying is you know obviously research your player prices before you actually go ahead and pick up the player on the 59th minute method if you don't know what the 59th minute method is it's basically where you go to the 59 minute wait there for deals to be put on because 1 hour listing time is the most popular listing time for players to be put up into the transfer market so if there is any players which people have put up uh you know cheaper than then than what they are actually worth then it's um you know it's in your hands to go ahead and pick them up and then be able to sell them on Prop profit and make some tidy coins so I'm going to show you a tip which I used to use back in FIFA 12 um to do this without getting bored and so that I could do something else and it's pretty pretty useful and productive so as you can see here I'm going to switch try and switch the camera around no I cannot do that um okay so let's go ahead and and I'll show you so this is basically what I did not invent this I remember seeing it on a YouTube video or something um but as you can see there is a hairband around the left stick and then around the RT stick and basically what that is doing is this okay that is basically just going through all the pages and it's going up to the 59th minute now I'm on 9 minutes and 35 seconds um after about I would say it could be probably about 10 minutes I'd say so obviously this is something that you do whilst you're you know on the computer or something else um this isn't something that you would do you know just by like basically it's an easier way of doing it than just doing it yourself manually uh this is kind of like a bit of a cheat I guess you could say so um yeah that's a quick way of getting to the 70 well the 59th minute without doing any work you can just do something else watch some YouTube videos what's your favorite YouTubers do whatever um so yeah I thought I might as well show you guys that tip if you seem to like it and it seemed to help you please let me know in the comment section below and if you tried it out let me know if it works um because I'd be very very inclined all you need is literally a hair band or you know maybe I don't know an elastic band a piece of rope string whatever um yeah pretty much pretty geeky pretty geeky tactic but there we go it's simple done um so yeah thanks for watching guys have a nice day if you enjoyed the video smash that like button that' be absolutely amazing and uh stay tuned for 7 minutes squad builder later after the football which is with man of the match King so make sure you are there thanks for watching have a nice day hope you enjoyed the video and peace"
