        "transcript": "hello YouTube my name is Nick and today I have another episode of my gun of the day series today I am using the 390 with a silencer the p90 does a maximum damage of 30 minimum damage of 20 and has a very high fire rate along with a very large clip it comes with a lot of ammo you have I believe 50 bullets per clip and you get a hundred extra bullets that's 150 bullets in total and that's that's quite a lot of bullets you can cause quite a lot of deaths with this weapon but apparently you can't shoot through walls - well I was just very inaccurate there anyways I definitely like this gun a lot better than the vector which I used yesterday I get off to a great start as you can see there it killed quite quickly but no I actually do quite well this game I'm using a 5 7 9 kill streak setup so not gonna be getting avoid too many kills from the kill streaks I don't believe but I do get a few of them this gun is actually decent any medium longest range I'd still recommend you stay kind of like short to medium range with this gun like you saw there I wish again people from a distance and because I was shooting at them from such a distance I wasn't really killing them so I moved closer that's why I'm using marathon I do recommend using marathon with this gun because you have that large clip you don't really need to worry loading really quickly or anything like that so you can put on the marathon sneak up behind them what I tend to do with smg's is either I sneak up behind people or I run I use the marathon in the mobility to run to an area like near their spawn where I can just continually shoot them and once they either start moving to a different spot or their spawn changes or something all then you know take a moment to catch my breath and then find where they are spawning next and I'll go run over to where their new spawn point is so then that's a good strategy that you can use with an SMG I also recommend you silence most SMGs the p90 definitely definitely like it silenced kind of like lowers the recoil a little bit and you know right here I thought I was really gonna kicked out of this game but the lag kind of went away and I'm alive so I was I was kind of grateful for that because I do get a very nice score this game for a regular team deathmatch so it's a good thing I didn't get to go because valannus I think that's my last stuff there my source fifteen and three right now so it's gonna go up quite a bit anyways the p90 is a decent amount of accuracy it bounces a little bit but it always goes back to the same point which is good you know some guns they'll bounce all over the place and you won't get back to the point that you started aiming at which is kind of annoying sometimes so this is it's decent at the medium to longer it medium and I wouldn't really recommend long range but as you can see right here the guys in the plane and a good distance and I kill him and then my my pave low get to the other kill I thought I'd gotten a double spray or something but it was my payload doing some damage to them because this gun has lots of ammo I recommend you don't use scavenger like I guess you can if you really want to but I tend I tend to do fairly well with just the ammo that you get with an SMG you know the point of the SMG really isn't to get 30 or 40 kill streaks the point of using an SMG is to kind of like be mobile and you know be really powerful in close-range situations an objective games there they're good for actually like capturing flags and stuff but I'm using these spas as a secondary because I don't know why I tend to like using the spas but basically whenever I have a mobile class like a SMG or something of that sort and it's it's a decent secondary like you can get kills like 20 feet away with it so it's a good close range but if you're really worried about running out of ammo you can use something like a pp-2000 or a and then 3r Africa and that will help you get kills until you can find another weapon anyways the game is coming to an end here I do get the game-winning hill finish that guy off going a nice little spa's streak final score was 44 kills and three deaths that's pretty good for for a regular team deathmatch I'd say anyways if you liked the video please click the like and subscribe if you would like to see more of my videos I'll see you guys there bye"

        "transcript": "[Music] this afternoon Honda took the wraps off the fourth generation of its popular CRV crossover vehicle at the Los Angeles Auto Show last week I had a chance to spend some time behind the wheel of the all new 2012 model at a press preview event and here are some of my thoughts although boasting styling that is more evolutionary than revolutionary the latest version can boast of Greater Fuel and packaging efficiency as well as added features and functionality All trim levels feature Honda's 2.4 L ivtec 4-cylinder engine paired to a standard 5-speed automatic transmission for 2012 horsepower has been up from 180 to 185 while torque has also been increased from 161 to 163 lb feet despite the increase in horsepower and torque EPA estimated fuel economy for front-wheel drive versions is now rated at 23 31 and 26 that is City Highway and combined MPG an increase of plus two plus three and plus two respectively all-wheel drive variants are now rated at 22325 City Highway combined MPG an increase of plus one plus three and plus two respectively all this is aided by a new Eco assist function it features two crescent-shaped ambient light bars flanking the speedometer that gradually morph from white to Green is a reward for efficient driving while a selectable econ mode Alters operating characteristics to further support fuel economy inside Honda has added refinements to what was already a class leading interior by pushing the windshield forward and adding additional sound insulation noise levels have also been reduced the new CRV also features a larger center console with sliding lid and enough storage for a hand Bay it also hides standard USB and auxiliary ports as well as a 12volt power outlet and while the console houses the requisite two cup holders it also has under storage areas on either side large enough to accommodate a standard water bottle new standard Technologies available on all models come in the form of iPhone supported Pandora internet radio as well as SMS text reading and response for supported Blackberry devices via a new standard 5-in color multi-function display other new added standard features include a wide view rear camera Bluetooth connectivity and a one touch fold down rear seat with the release levers located on either side of the rear storage area and speaking of storage despite the fact that the new CRV is both shorter and lower by an inch Honda has managed to increase the cargo capacity behind the rear seat from 35.7 to 37.2 cubic feet the rear liftover height with a tailgate open has also been reduced from 27.1 to 26.1 in while passenger volume is also up slightly outside the despite the fact that the styling and shape will be familiar to all the fourth generation CRV shares nothing with its predecessor it not only looks sleer it actually is with an 8% drag coefficient Improvement up front the CRV features its own interpretation of Honda's Boulder looking three bar front grill and deeply set multi-reflector headlights along the sides there is deeper sculpting of the body lines while the signature vertical rear tail lights are now more three-dimensional as they wrap around the rear quarter panels design elements that include a longer roof line and integrated rear spoiler also add to the crossover's improved AOW dnamic efficiency the 2012 Honda CRV will be available in five trim levels LX EX EXL EXL with navigation and EXL with a rear entertainment center in addition to the aforementioned standard features all LX models come standard with air conditioning power windows and locks cruise control and tilt and telescoping steering steering wheel electronic stability control ABS with brake assist and driver passenger side curtain and front side airbags are also standard it also comes with Honda's new motion adaptive electric power steering that works in conjunction with the vehicle stability control system and detecting vehicle instability in Slippery road conditions during corner and braking to initiate inputs into the system did prompt the driver to steer in the correct direction by waiting the system in conditions of over steer and lightening the feel if it detects vehicle under steer stepping up to the ex add 17-in alloy wheels privacy glass and a power moonroof along with other niceties such as upgraded interior cloth cargo cover passenger armrest and a security system the EXL trim level adds a leather interior and heated front seats with a driver's power seat an audio system with XM radio and a subwoofer an automatic climate control while the EXL with navigation adds a satellite link navigation system with voice recognition and FM traffic the EXL with rear entertainment substitutes the navigation with a wireless DVD system that allows front seat passengers to listen to something different while the Rees audio comes through the wireless headphones in back on the road the new CRV feels solid and well planted despite some heavy Crosswinds it never felt skittish even at freeway speeds noise level was also down from that of the previous generation the new interior is both more useful in purpose and more elegant in design unlike the Civic the cr-v's Eco button hardly seems out of place in particular the new amenities from Storage to connectivity will make it an even more appealing choice for buyers looking for the most bang for the buck despite the recent Supply disruptions caused by the flooding in Thailand Honda has stated that there will be no delays in bringing the 2012 CRV to showrooms by its on sale date of December 15th just ahead of when manufacturer suggested prices will also be released"
