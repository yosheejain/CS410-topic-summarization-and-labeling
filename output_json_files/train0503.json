        "transcript": "(gentle music) - I think bee pollen's possibly the most generally, powerful food on the planet. - It's a general. It's got 56 enzymes, 56 minerals, maybe\n3,000 different enzymes. It's maybe 20% protein. It has a certain kind of lecithin which is way better than soy lecithin for the brain. It's really a powerhouse. It is the highest Ojas food using our terms, postnatal Jing food on the planet. Why? Because it's the Jing of the whole plant world. That is of significance. Jing of the whole plant world. I recommend at one to\ntwo tablespoons a day. It really is just a general Ojas builder, a general Jing builder. That's the best way to think about it. Yes, it may be good for the ovaries. Yes, it may be good for this or that. But ovaries is Jing. It's a Jing builder. And that's the best way to understand it, Ojas builder, foundational builder. - [Voiceover] The bee pollen\nwe get here in the store, is it good enough for again other problems? - [Voiceover] It's not organic. - [Voiceover] Is there organic? Like, if you're looking for it. - There is from New Zealand. It's very expensive and you have to hike 50 miles in to go harvest it. But we get, but it's really expensive, like $50 a pound, something like that. - [Voiceover] So the stuff we get at Whole Foods stores over here, is that good enough? Or is it like the goji berries? That's my question. - Yes. - [Voiceover] You said it's a no-no. - Yes. - [Voiceover] So, it's a no? - Yes, no, you actually\nhave to ask the question. Right now the bees are kind of dying out. It's a big problem. The pharmaceutical\ncompanies that are creating the pesticides, herbicides that are killing them, I just read that Bayer voted on it but I don't know what the vote was. The vote was do we keep\nproducing this one thing that's killing the bees, that will destroy the planet but will hurt our profits, or... No literally, they just voted a few weeks ago and I don't know the result of that voting. Maybe somebody can look that up on the internet. But whatever, what I'm trying to say is the bees are going out of business, which means humanity's\ngoing out of business. It's a very serious problem. - [Voiceover] Yes, there\nwas a children's movie about that a few years ago. - Yeah well, it's\ngetting not a movie time, it's reality time. It's reality TV here. And okay, so the answer is it's hard to get good bee pollen anymore. That's what the answer is. Organic gets hard because there's so much pesticide, herbicide use. That's why the bees are dying out. So the question is where do you choose? We still are able to\nget organic bee pollen where we are, okay. And you can get the highest quality from New Zealand, which as I explained is in a pristine area. There's no pesticides, herbicides around. Literally, there's no roads. You can't even get into it. You have to hike in however and it's expensive. But that's what you have to do to get some of these things because of how ignorant and greedy people are in the world around not being concerned about ecology. It's like a very bad situation. So the answer is if I had to choose between, I probably would still\ntake less bee pollen but still take it because it's so potent. I would make a real\neffort to look at the area where you're getting your bee pollen from and say, \"Well, is this\nan industrial area? \"Is this up where we don't \"have industry in Israel? \"Is it going to have less\npesticides and herbicides?\" You see what I'm saying here? You gotta know your owner and you gotta actually speak to him. It has to be at that level to sort it out. (gentle music)"

        "transcript": "hello everybody I'm ask Joshy and I'm Frank fields and we both work at IGN pro league you may recognize us from casting Starcraft or uh sometimes I cast shoot Mania but um both of us play a lot of Magic the Gathering so we decided to just uh have a little bit of a discussion show about some of the new cards coming out for Gate Crash which the pre-release is on January 26th and the set actually comes out in February but uh if you didn't know a lot of cards are being spoiled already I like to use Magic spoilercomment which is r/ Magic TCG to get all those spoilers so if you want to uh get ahead of us you can check out those sites but we're going to be basically talking about each of the cards that are coming out as spoilers uh as they come out and the first one that was officially spoiled uh some cards actually kind of snuck through and got spoiled I think someone found them in a dumpster or something like that next to the plant but yeah the first one that was officially spoiled was fathom AG um which is a one green one blue and two colorless uh the simix first card that was spoiled um it's a one- one creature that has evolve evolve was a new mechanic that was introduced where if a creature comes into the battlefield under your control with power or toughness greater than it it gets a plus one plus one counter now this is a really cool card to introduce the mechanic because in addition to the fact that it has evolved whenever it gets a plus one plus1 counter you get to draw a card that's true so again evolve is the new mechanic for the simic guild uh if you don't know return to ravika and Gate Crash are all just full of Guild that's two color combinations simic is green and blue it seems to be pretty creature intensive because obviously green that's like the motif is just lots and lots of creatures and Blue's Motif is very spell oriented so evolve is I think it fits uh it's kind of like a bioengineering feel or genetically engineering feel and it kind of makes sense when you merge the themes of green and blue together so it's actually pretty cool I think they have a lot of fish people and crocodile FR yeah the crocodile FR human I think is kind of like an amphibious human type looking thing it looks actually really cool with the art so so now that we know evolve again these creatures come in as little guys like 1 one 02 something like that maybe they have an ability there's a a 01 flyer for example with evolve that was spoiled and we'll talk about that later on but um evolve could be a really really cool mechanic if you really like playing a lot of creatures um obviously blue gives you the benefit of having a lot of counter spells and control at the same time so I'm I'm expecting a lot of tap down mechanics because you're going to have so many creatures and blue that's that's just a way to one of the interesting things that happened in this last rotation is you know B became a huge color combination which is white blue green um this kind of adds to that and so maybe you know fathom Mage seems It's not really it's kind of a controlly card but it's a little expensive for a creature so there's a lot of different ways that you could approach this you could like try to put in a mid-range Deck with you know that kind of three to six Mana cost creature range um but there's also something you know with where people could go back to you know the draw Ghost style of playing where people just didn't play creatures in game and then drop that for more card Advantage there's a lot of different ways that you can use this um the first way that I thought about using fathom AG was actually using things like common Bond or increasing savy to just put counters on it which gets you a lot of cards and gets you a big creature but you know it's vulnerable just like any other creature in the fact it doesn't have hex proof it doesn't have evasion it doesn't protect itself very well but um I it's for me it's the carard I'm most looking forward to trying to figure out a way to break because out of all the mechanics especially on fathom age evolv with the fact that when it grows gets you card Advantage is really really unique yeah common Bond and increasing savagery are like the the really obvious applications and um you know that's going to get you a big burst of cards you can almost play it like a Sphinx's Revelation sort of but the the thing is like let's say fathom Mage gets huge gets a ton of ton ton of counters on it after that it's just a huge draw engine that's not you could use it as a Blocker in some instances but you don't really want to be attacking with it because you know you're getting lots of card from it you don't want to ruin that so sometimes you know combat tricks could get rid of that if you SC around too much people have also brought up that it synergizes really well with gagari um especially car like scaven corpse Jack Menace so that it gets twice the amount of counters you can try to abuse it that way um and then there's the fact that you know with some of the other simic cards that come out there's a way to transfer plus one counters from one creatures to another so um and then there's also ways you can use it with say Restoration Angel where you get it big and then you reset it back to one and then enter the battlefield and synergize pretty well thrag test because you can get two creatures that way um it has a lot of interactions with things that are popular and standard right now yep so if you had to give this a a score we're going to use just a one through five scale because that's what everybody does and it's understandable um for limited play what do you think it's going to look like um in limited it's it's anywhere between two to three to me because if you get things that are able to put counters on fathom age or if you just get a lot of like mid-range creatures in in limited drawing cards is really really powerful especially when you're making your creature bigger while you're drawing cards and if fathom age gets up to like a 66 like it's hard to actually stop that at limit there's not a lot of creatures that'll be able to just one-on-one that in combat and it's already kned you a ton of cards um in in constructed it's hard I want to say three uh but it's probably closer to 2.5 I guess would be the way you'd say it because while it is something that you might be able to break it's not really that strong by itself where man it's four Mana whereas cards obviously like thrag Tusk is in almost any deck that has grain that's just good by itself whereas B Mage you kind of have to find a way to break it that's true it requires other pieces to the puzzle but in limited I agree drawing cards is just crazy good I'm a little curious how drafts will go with all the evolved creatures you don't necessarily want a ton of evolvers because then you're not triggering it as often um so you're going to want a good balance of evolved creatures and other green and blue creatures that are just you know fatties uh so you can keep everything growing at once and you know we obviously still need a lot more card spoiled to see if fathom age is going to be that must have card or or not so um I don't know as much about constructed I would say probably a little lower than Frank is hoping I think he's just excited about it um I'm going to give it a two you know it's not obviously not useless but again it's uh it requires other pieces and that can be tough in standard when you've got things that are running around by themselves being very powerful so I think that's pretty much it for fathom Mage thanks very much for watching this is our pilot episode we're going to go ahead and record a few of these all at once just so we can get a hang of uh you know how we're going to have these discussions and uh please feel free to comment on the video uh share it with your friends if if you'd like to uh and follow us on Twitter and yeah I guess that's it I'll go ahead and put the uh the Twitter names below us yeah that'll be good all right and that made it into the video so thanks very much we'll be back with more uh Magic reviews and possibly a show named at some point in the future as well that would be helpful yeah all right see you guys bye guys"

        "transcript": "hey guys what's going on in sugar Lanie and today I'm bringing to you my top favorite new nude lip glosses for brown skin of women so let's get started on showing you my favorites and the first one I want to show you is my ultimate favorite my number one nude lip gloss lipstick whatever equal lipstick whatever you want to pull this particular one and it isn't the color in the color elites and again this is the one I have on my lips and I purchased this for $18 in Sephora the applicator is like a light brush little type of applicator which I actually really really like um and this texture to this is a little bit sticky it's not crazy sticky it's just a little bit sticky but that's something that's just like not important to me because I just left this one I love because it's perfect and this looks amazing over my Mac Viva my Mac's Viva Glam 5 new lipstick perfect combination guys there's a combination the next one want to show you is from Sephora news from the Sephora brand and it's applause me or in the color sweet caramel and it is a frosted finish the other one um the lorac one is a cream finish this one is a four-set finish which I don't mind at all because when you put on your lips is not overpoweringly for us which I know a lot of girls are turned off about and sometimes I'm a little bit turned off about um about that so here it is and sweet caramel and this is just a really good color especially if you don't want any nude lip gloss that has any pink undertones like say you're wearing a nude lipstick a nude lipstick that's brown but you want to kind of keep it that way this I would suggest for you guys instead of going more towards the pinky nudes if you want to lay a gloss over it that's a new color I would suggest something like this again this is a sweet caramel and this is these watch for it right there the next one want to show you is from Mac and it's a lip Jilly Jilly Jilly I don't know all these French I don't know what's going on and this isn't a color glass of vitality and this was also a frosty finish but this is a really light frosty finish and this is really good I'm gonna say you guys I don't know purchases from Mac Sony got this for like five dollars so this could be real this could be fake I don't know actually Google did is actually a real color and a you know live jelly and all that jazz I just think it from max so here it is and I paid $5.00 for it and here is a swatch and again this is a color that is more of a brown nude not more of a pinky nude again so if you wanted to wear something over your lip gloss that wasn't that that didn't that doesn't excuse me that doesn't have a pink undertone to it I can't even suggest to see you cuz I don't even know if they sell this anymore but I would get something along this color these two colors you don't have to necessarily get these brand um these particular you know products but the colors I would suggest again here it is and it's a lighter frosty so it's not like it's overpowering but this one's not overpowering either but this one is it's delish you know you can barely see the for us that's what I'm trying to say o Muhammad okay so the next one I want to show you is called mirror mauve and this is from Maybelline's color sensational new lip glosses this one is a nude lip a nude lip color it's actually in the bottle is in the bottle or the container whatever you want to call it in the tube it looks fair it's basically almost the same color as I'm Lauren but when you put it on your lips or any wearing it body it just shows much more pink so here it is right there and it's mirrored walls and I paid about nine dollars for this one I actually have another one I don't know where it is I have another one of their new color sensational I guess that's what it's called and it's an iced chocolate so that one is more of brown it's more of a brown new color which is perfect I really mean like that one and it doesn't have any pink undertones to it it's a really really nice excuse me a really nice color I wish I can show you what it looks like I'm going to look for it and then I'm just gonna have a picture at the end of the video of what it looks like okay so the next one I'm going to show you is Revlon's Revlon's this burning is so small Revlon Super Lustrous lip gloss in nude luster and here it is right here and if you see me in my tutorials if you see me use a nude lip gloss I've used this one quite a lot and actually use this a lot too these are the two I use the most so this is one this one is a light brown actually this one's pretty similar to ice chocolate I shall just leave a bit browner but um very similar to the iced chocolate Maybelline Color sensational and the swatch this one is right here it's very light it's not too crazy which I love and it's not sticky a lot the ones that I showed you here after the lorac one they're not sticky they're not sticky at all which is a really good thing again the Laura wants just a tad bit sticky but I don't really care about that because I love it and I love the color okay so the last one I want to show you is the NYX mega shine lip gloss in natural and um yeah here's the color and this one's more of a pinky nude and if you know anything about the NYX the NYX um mega shine lip gloss you know these ones are super pigmented I love these and I paid $5.00 for this oh and I paid $8 for this one so let me show you the swatch to the natural one and it's this bottom one right there and again this one's a pinky nude one I don't use this one as well thin as the other two but I definitely when I want a pinky nude I will tend to reach for that one okay so those were my top favorite new lip glosses for brown-skinned women again some of them more um I actually know actually I'm lying to you one with $18 the rest no were affordable um if you would consider like $10 not affordable then it wasn't affordable but um yeah they were affordable just a little rack one that was just like super expensive but um yeah I really hope this helped you guys um with your search for new lip glosses or really pigmented lip glosses or liquid lipsticks I'm sorry if i seemed scattered Brian I've actually been filming for the past three hours and I'm just like ah so yeah until next time guys"

        "transcript": "yo what's going on this D man you already know bringing to you some NBA 2K15 today we're back at the rec center I know it's been a minute it's been a minute since I posted some W gameplay it's been a minute since I played the W but I was able to get a few games in not a lot of games because you know those got net spots are trying to hold us back but I was able to get a few games in so you know I had to bring some gameplay to you guys I'm running with my boy Styles Biz Jay get Buckets and Godzilla and you know we're trying to put it in work on these Oldtown flyers and I was surprised because I haven't played the break in about probably two or three weeks and now there's Legends all over the place we're going against the legend 3 right now so you know we not trying to lose and also man these dudes before the game as always sent my boy Styles a message talking about we scared to play them so we can't let them punk us right like we got to play them that's the real deal no pickle but I will say this whole session man boy I was playing some struggle ball I couldn't knock down shots I was turning the ball over like this whole session I was pretty much just a random on the court luckily my whole Squad they got me man like if I'm having a bad game it's not going to really matter because somebody on the court will make up for it whether it be Biz sty jais buckets or Zilla somebody going to be putting in work but you see me doing the same old thing I always doing the wreck knocking down the mid-range jumpers standing in my little corner that's what I like to do I like my bubble give me my space when I play the wreck because that's my hot spot and I need to be a spot up shooter so we back on d uh he almost air balled that maybe he did airball but we pushing this up court I'm going find Jay get Buckets on the left side strange range he's knocking that down I mean that's one thing I am good for right I can get a dime here and there because I have that dier badge once you get that dier badge the wreck it becomes easy so we locking up once again look at styles on the rotation he actually helped me out right there b is leaking out but he's not going to take it he's going to pass it off and you know I'm banging that damn that boy good throwing that down you know the deal once I see the rim you know I'm trying to freak it or I would like to I mean after pat three I can't bang on nobody anymore not at the wreck I'm good in my career but at the wreck I'm not banging on nobody so it's all good but we're back at it again look at Biz stuff like a turkey getting a nice block and you know my boy Styles he's about to reward him wait for it wait for it throwing that oop up to the biz James okay Biz I see you out here putting in work I'm not used to seeing that like I'm used to seeing Biz in the corner shooting but he out here booming too shoot let me fall back man so we back at it again o a piece of candy we get a nice steal styles he's going to pass it up but I'm going just bring that out I thought about shooting it but I'm going just pass it around see what we have and look at me and styles playing Hot Potato like no you got it you got it no you got to shoot that you have the strange range I have the dimer the perfect combination Styles he's going to knock down that shot and we needed that man these Oldtown flyers I mean yeah that was kind of big yeah that was kind of cheesing but they were giving us a pretty close game so we had to break it open a bit so Zilla swinging it around I'mma find buckets in the corner everybody out here can shoot itself from me like I was low-key salty like you guys don't understand like I was out here building a two-story house with all these bricks I was throwing up I just could not believe it but like I said my teammates had my back but you know when your teammates doing good and you not doing good and you kind of mad but you lowkey happy for them that's how I was yesterday I know that was kind of confusing but I mean I know we've all been there before but look at Zilla Finding Me in My Corner in my hot spot and I barely made that like struggle ball to the maximum but hey at least I was able to knock it down at least I'm able to knock down something so we're back on D this whole game we were pretty much locking people up we were rotating really well so you see Zilla snagging AB board like he always does and I kind of feel like rewarding him for that look at that flying down the lane I see you Zilla just keep running got to feed the big man throwing that oop up you know my boy Zilla he throwing it down so at the end of the third we built up a pretty nice lead like we got real comfortable and honestly this squad or not even just this squad I don't understand why a bunch of squads do this at the r they were running the Zone but didn't know how to run the zone or maybe we just knew how to beat the Zone really well I mean that might have been the case too but look at this just leaving people wi open leaving assignments like it's not bad to play manto man it really isn't like you don't have to run the Zone people out here on the wreck running the Zone just cuz it looks cool I mean I'm not trying to sound cocky or arrogant but if you don't know how to run the Zone don't do it because you're going to come across the squad you was talking trash to and that zone it's going to get exposed I'm not saying that happened this game but I'm just saying throwing that out there so yeah this whole game was pretty much exposing their Zone breaking the Zone I mean look at this you see me waiting at a bounds because I'm plotting I stay scheming cutting back door damn that boy good Styles saw me on the back door cut I was like Styles look how much they playing up dog I got to take this back door and he threw that oop up and I was able to throw it down so once again they coming out here shooting bad shots I mean that's what teams do when they get flustered and that's what we want them to do cuz if you shoot a bad shot you know my boy B leaking out you know I'm going to be ready for that pass down low and it's going to be an easy two points so once again another bad shot goes up and if a bad shot goes up a Ali oop is going up Jay get buckus is going to throw me a l right there and honestly I will say that even though I can't dunk on people I can still finish Alli oops at a really high rate it must be that Lob City finisher badge because I can still boom those Ali oops I just can't dunk it on people I don't know why I wish that posterizer badge would activate but you know as long as we get points I'm not going to complain about it so we keep building this lead look at the bad pass oh a piece of candy you know we leaking out three on one fast break you know I'm dropping this dime real quick never mind I mean I'm dropping this dime next time next fast break I'll drop a dime that was just an ugly turnover but that's how I was playing yesterday man getting mad turnovers missing mad shots I was out here just struggling playing straight struggle ball like I said earlier so you see Styles going in for the dunk I mean must be nice I wish I could dunk on people like that matter of fact Styles yo let me get that rock styles let me see what I can do real quick Styles going to pass it over to me I see that lane wide open oh man see no man I ain't going for it I see that lane Wild open again I can't dunk on people anymore like after playing the wreck yesterday I almost deleted my my player because I just don't want to see this dude on the court anymore he out here getting pumped but it's all good man I'm going just do what I do and on the r i just shoot threes I just shoot mid-range jumpers I'm a shooter I'm a Ray Allen can't be dunking can't be dribbling can't be doing anything like that just shoot that's what I'm here for man I need to recognize my role so I'm going pass it download to styles that was a bad pass but luckily Styles was able to pass out to Zilla and Zilla he's going to get the finish my boy Zilla always be running the fast break as a big man I love seeing that but at the end of the game our opponents they just came out shooting three-pointers I mean they might as well right they was trying to get Buckets but we still out here throwing lobs though don't go down there boy that's grow man territory in the paint if you down there while I'm catching the lob you about to get boomed on but anyway anyways that's going to be the end of this game play this dude said we were scared to play them scared n this game we was kind of bored we wasn't scared though but hey it is what it is people really got to wait to talk trash after the game that's how it works out you win you talk trash you can't talk trash before a game because sometimes you might lose and you standing on the god net all embarrassed I'm not saying that happened this game but I'm just saying peace"

        "transcript": "hey guys what's going on my name is daniiel cross and today I want to talk to you guys about Call of Duty advanced warfare and more particularly sniping in the multiplayer there's a lot of discussions on forms right now about how quick scoping and sniping should be removed from Call of Duty advanced warfare and just kind of pitched you know throw it away it doesn't belong there it's cheating it's whatever and I want to get a lot of attention on this hopefully from Sledgehammer so if you guys can go ahead and leave a like or share this with your friends tweet about it just get people to acknowledge that sniping is not cheap it's not cheating it's not any of those and it doesn't deserve to be patched and removed from the Call of Duty game or the title in general uh the game hasn't even been announced other than the release trailer we don't have any information for Call of Duty Advanced Warfare right now it's literally people just jumping to conclusions and that's what I feel I hear about all the time with quick scoping as soon as it's brought up with the new game I hope they patch it so I really want to get some attention on this so I appreciate your guys' support and uh let's talk about why I feel quick scoping right off the bat is not overpowered in the slightest first up we need to talk about confirmation bias and then I will go through the actual patches and how they patch snipers in general but confirmation bias is where players expect something to go a certain way and when it doesn't go that way um usually that abnormal change in the pattern that rough change you remember that more it stands out more so a really good example of this is the Predator Missiles from Modern Warfare 2 um I always get killed by them is what you hear well you don't always always get killed by them but you definitely remember when they do um the same thing goes for snipers this is how it affects snipers uh people usually just steamroll through you know 10 20 snipers they always kill them whatever but that one time the sniper eats like two bullets and then turn around and shoots them that's really frustrating and that's confirmation bias you feel like every single time a sniper kills you well a sniper might kill you but you don't remember how many times you actually literally just own snipers before that you only remember the downside and the part that stands out in your mind that's confirmation bias so I feel that it's a really unjust thing for people just to always complain about snipers always kill me well shotguns C4 IEDs all of those things always kill me but I really don't complain about them a whole lot even though my opinion on some of those should be about iids and things like that of low skill should be removed but that's an entirely different video and I will save you guys from that rant itself but let's get into how snipers have been patched in the past to me snipers have been patched more than any other weapon or class in general I can't think of any other class that has had as many patches per game that just address a specific weapon um snipers themselves roughly get three to five patches per game and they get progressively worse over time like because the effects of the patch build up and up like if you increase the uh ads time on a weapon in the first patch and then you do it for the next three well you just increase the ads time three times in a row making it significantly harder and just completely brutalizing that weapon over a period of time it kind of sneaks it in there and people are like oh it's not a big deal they just patched it the first time but then after the second and the third and the fourth and the fifth it kind of drives people away from your game hence Call of Duty ghost and that's a big red flag to me it doesn't necessarily matter what the weapon is but if you can drive an entire Community to stop playing your game and go back to an older console or a different version of Call of Duty on whatever concert you're playing on that's a significant red flag to me that goes hey we might have patched a weapon a little bit too much and we need to go back and fix that so let's take a look at patches for sniper rifles and how they work first up is ADS delay ads delay is a little bit more complicated than just scoping in there is a scope in delay it takes how long it takes to pull up your scope to actually get the crosshairs but ads delay itself is a little bit different it was introduced in Black Ops 1 alongside of sway so you had your ads time you had your sway that you had to get over and then you have ads delay which is a little bit different it's a timer in the game where once you Scope in your bullet doesn't go to where your crosshairs are pointing until that timer hits zero so you could shoot a little bit too quickly and your bullet would go randomly like it' be a hip fire for example it was very inaccurate and was very just terrible for anyone who tried to snipe normally or regularly uh it was in between each shot too not just if you scoped in so people that were actually sniping um traditionally how I would like to say um they were even struggling Ling to hit shots because people would just be running by them too quickly and they can't keep up another factor is hit boxes on sniper rifles hit boxes are usually pretty all right it depends on the game Call of Duty ghost has some all right hit boxes uh Black Ops was okay Black Ops 2 is a little bit like a little bit more restricted depending on the weapon uh the majority of semi-automatic sniper rifles are only a headshot only kill some sniper rifles are actually two shot kills no matter what uh if you have a silencer on them kind of like the dragonov but uh no one really uses silencers but to me they've kind of moved away from semi-automatic 50 caliber weapons if you look at uh Modern Warfare 2 and MW3 you had the as50 you had the Barrett 50 cal and those weapons were pretty good because they would get you a head neck chest and stomach kill now in Black Ops 2 the DSR itself is a head chest and stomach kill but at the same time it's a bolt action they completely changed it and they slowed it down to where it's a bolt action the the bolt action fire rate of the DSR has been patched 8 months into the game to shoot 1.5 rounds uh per second so that's 40 rounds per minute roughly um in that time of 1.5 seconds other weapons can shoot anywhere between 15 to 32 rounds that's pretty insane to me that you can shoot 15 to 30 rounds with another weapon and the sniper can't actually do anything during that time they're sitting there in reloading they don't have time to ads they don't have time to aim we can't go over you know Sprint delay or anything like that they're just significantly patched already map Styles kind of don't really cater to sniping anyway uh that's why I feel quick scoping itself is more of a tool it's a fundamental way that allows snipers to be somewhat effective in Call of Duty for how the maps are it doesn't work like Battlefield Battlefield is so big that it doesn't matter people can't just literally Run and Jump Around the Corner it really doesn't work like that for snipers in that game Call of Duty is a very fastpac in-your-face shooter and having quick scoping there allows snipers to be a little bit more aggressive allows them to play objectively if they so choose to and just be a little bit more reliable I really don't think that this should be removed from Call of Duty I know a lot of people on my channel will probably agree with me but at the same time if you look at how they've been patched in the past there's really not a lot of reason for it and that's something that people don't understand snipers are not running around with 30 KDs every game usually they barely break even so I don't think it's that big of an issue it's also something like a learn skill it takes time these players who actually go around quick scoping and sniping are high skill players and we shouldn't punish skilled players by reducing their effectiveness over something that took time to learn anyway guys I hope you enjoyed this video I'm a little bit tired so I need to go to bed and uh if you guys want to go ahead and leave a like on this I'd really appreciate it and Sledgehammer I'm really looking forward to Call of Duty Advanced Warfare it looks pretty interesting from the reveal trailer everyone seems to be excited so hopefully you guys can get our support for at least supporting sniping for what it's grown into within the Call of Duty series anyway guys this cross I hope I will see you soon with another video as always take care"

        "transcript": "hey guys Lord nitrum here and today I'm going to be talking about how to use the at launcher or the at launcher or the ATL however you want to refer to it the at launcher is essentially kind of like the feed the beast launcher or even the Technic Launcher it's used for installing and launching large mod packs to run on Minecraft and the first thing you want to know about this is the fact that much like Feed the Beast it's going to need its own directory so when you download the the jar or the exe put it in its own folder because the first time you run it it's going to create all these other folders and start populating them with whatever it needs and from there you can create a shortcut onto your desktop or into the start menu wherever you want to put it uh for me I'll probably create another quick launch bar up here or something to make it blend in better with my very pristine desktop that I work hard to keep organized I decided to make this video because a few days ago my friend Tim launched a server running resident Rise 3 and we're all switching over to that from Feed the Beast because the server we normally play on there is kind of under some work so in the meantime we're going to be playing Resident Rise 3 and I'll probably release some Let's Plays of that or something of that nature and I decided to do this video because most of our friends are jumping over to play on our server with us of course and it's easier to kind of demonstrate how this works compared to feed the beast rather than have to type everything in Steam chat or talk about it on TeamSpeak so hopefully this is helpful to you guys and any other viewers that decide to come through here so once you launch it it's going to take a while to load up uh it's going to take longer than mine has just now because it'll have to make all the other folders and so on and so forth the first time you launch every time you launch it's going to bring you to the new screen first and as you can see it's got tabs similar to feed the beast and the one tab I wish was still here compared to feed the beast is the texture tab unfortunately there's no texture packs uh to pre or Auto install for you anyways once you get in here you can go into settings you can mess with the maximum RAM usage and everything which is always good when you're using large packs like this you want at least two or three gigs of RAM to use and then you want to come over to accounts and much like the other launchers you have to tie in your account here and you can remember the password or enter every single time but once that's done it lets you use your accounts down here at the bottom after you have your account added you can come over to the packs and this is where all the fun is much like Feed the Beast or techken there's all these fun packs you can download and play where it differs however is you don't launch directly from here what you do is you create a new instance and you can name that instance whatever you want you can run the various different versions available for download and then just install that it'll download everything to the downloads folder and once that's done you can play it so you could even name it at tutorial if you wanted and then install it it'll download everything for you so before it starts downloading right away this is another part where it differs and the fact that it's going to have all the required mods over here and then everything else is going to be over here and most servers for Resident Rise 3 use the main line option mods which will pre-select everything for you there's also light for if your computer can't handle Mainline and uh for the previous version which we're still running on our server there was an option for excessive which adds a lot of mods and it's for really beefy computers as it as it likes to say uh for my friends watching we're not using the most current we're using version 3.2.3 point2 uh once you select that you can select Mainline and there's all these additional mods you can select and addon which is nice if servers want to run you know say a main line but with a few additional things which is what we decided to do and there's even some client side mods you can add such as voxal map or th craft Nei plugin which is helpful so for my friends watching real quick just come down to ex and add both the ex mods and then the other third optional mod we have is is back up here project e and project e is essentially for anyone who's ever played the really old uh Technic Pack before it got deemed Technic light and they made a new Mainline Technic Pack uh Project D is kind of just Equivalent Exchange 3 but it's been kept up to date nothing has been added it's just been kept up to date to have EMC values for other mods although for some reason it seems to be missing EMC values for all of thermal expans mention so once that's done and you have those selected you can go ahead and install I don't think anybody wants to watch me download mod packs right now so instead of installing I'm going to cancel this but once you install it list all your instances over here so here's the one that we would have just made which is the at tutorial as I said um I meant to select at the beginning for 32 32 but it'll tell you what the version is what you decide to name that instance if you want to get in particular with with uh reme you know naming it something so that it kind of reminds you oh this one is has these mod packs but the other one has these mod packs uh at that point you can also edit the mods as well view the mods you have add new ones which is useful if you want to play around with adding new mods to your version or if a server decides to update like let's say if um if wraith lit my buddy Tim decides he wants to enable intercontinental ballistic missiles mod on the server so that we can blow each other up from afar you know that's great he's just got to let me know we come into edit mods we check off ICBM and it'll update and you just click play you can also reinstall if there's any issues you're having update if uh you wanted to updates the newest version from 323 to something else um or you can just you know click play and once you do that just for anyone who's never used large mod packs before for example this one will have 200 2 mods or actually I believe it's 221 mods selected it's going to take a while to load up it'll take a good minute or two maybe even three or more if your computer you know isn't loading it up fast enough so when it launches Minecraft it might say that it's unresponsive for a little bit but it'll move past that it'll give you you know the Mojang uh icon loading screen and one nice thing about this mod pack compared to other is at the bottom it'll have a a red bar that moves across as it's loading and initializing all the mods so you can kind of watch the progress and know that's moving and of course near the end once it gets around 99% loaded it's going to be unresponsive for a few seconds before it brings you into the main screen so you can select multiplayer or single player I don't want to load it up now because as I said it takes a little while it takes about 2 minutes and I mean you pretty much know what to do at that point once you click play and it loads up just go play solo or go play with some friends I mean that's it so hopefully this was helpful for my friends and informative for anybody else out there who came across this and you know if you enjoyed it go ahead and maybe hit that subscribe button or give it a thumbs up appreciate it take care"

        "transcript": "hello everybody and welcome to top 5 Friday the show where we take a theme and then I let you know what I think are the top 5 games that fit the theme in this episode we're gonna be taking a look at what I think are the top 5 n64 first-person shooters number 5 was a really tough choice between doom 64 and the game that I eventually chose beam 64 is a really great first-person shooter is definitely underrated on the n64 but I decided to fifth place I'd go for Duke Nukem 64 now this is one game which pretty much everybody's played and you've probably played it on the PC before you played this port over on the n64 and whilst it's not the best graphically and has got a lot of character to the game there's lots of secret areas to find and I think that the controls the dialogue the story it's all quite fun games not to be taken too seriously but actually has got quite a bit of challenge in it as well that's why it didn't really finished too high on my list because it was a port of a PC game and by that point even the PC game was already out of date but it is still nevertheless a fun game to play in a fourth place we're gonna go with Perfect Dark now probably a lot of you all at thinking why is this not high up on the list and to be honest it is a really good game and a lot of people obviously were expecting the goldeneye 2 then it wasn't you know so quite as good as that and it didn't really reach the heights that gold and I reached despite the fact graphically technically is a much stronger game the reason why this wasn't high on the list for me was because even though it is a great game it was just something I didn't connect as much as Goldeneye and I don't think anybody who got perfect dark thought it reached highs at Goldeneye reached and also you must have been feeling a little bit disappointed when you eventually got to play the game because it didn't quite have that same magical feels it nevertheless though the graphics are brewing the multiplayer is still really fun and the game engine is absolutely fantastic it's probably the first person engine on the n64 in third place on our list I'm gonna go for two rock three now what before turret games on the n64 this one's definitely my favorite the first one I'm not too keen on the second one I thought was far too difficult range Wars I thought was fun but compared to multiplayer that you could already get on Goldeneye I'm as well as having a single-player campaign on there it wasn't quite as good and so I did decide to go for it to a three this is becoming quite expensive to get hold of especially completing box but in terms of the actual game itself I'd say it's probably got some of the best graphics from any game on any genre on the n64 it doesn't make use of the expansion pack which you know so it does help to improve that a lot of people I complain about the framerate in the game too it can drop quite slow sometimes the actual game itself is really fun to play it's completely different than a lot of the other turret games in terms of accepting the storyline is kind of sort of fitting together but it's a really great game and not too many people actually realize it exists which is quite surprising it did come out quite late in the n64 his life so you can have already played it definitely worth going and checking out number 2 on my list was quake 2 this is absolutely brilliant first-person shooter if you haven't played that you definitely need to go out and play this now a lot of people who may be watching this think I've already played quake 2 on you know PC when it came out the first time around this version of quake 2 was completely built from the ground up the same way that doom 64 was built specifically for the console quake 2 is an awesome game the graphics are really good on it it's got a huge campaign and different branching paths depending on you know how many secrets you find that you're playing the game I found it to be challenging but not to the point where it was you know sort of boring and stressing it felt like a fair challenge whereas a lot of first-person shooters you know fire loads of different enemies out yet and there tend to kill you there's always a good balance between it being just about difficult enough but being enjoyable to play I like the graphics in the storyline as you'd expect for credit games pretty much non-existent but I think that if you're looking for a really great first-person shooter then this is definitely one that you need to check out okay so that brings us to the number one spot and you can probably already all if you guess exactly what this is i'ma go with Goldeneye golden eyes up to brilliant there's not really horrible you can say about ticks it's one of those games that pretty much everybody has already played the graphics on this especially when you consider when it came out is one of the earlier in 64 titles even to this day really push the hard way quite far the most potent mode is what every video remembers it for you know talked about before everyone's got memories of sitting around playing Goldeneye warfare deathmatch mode no new this there's absolutely tons of Secrets Don Locke the story follows a film perfectly the balance of the gameplay is brilliant it's just an all-around enjoyable game has nothing really I could have fault with gold Knight is just you know nothing perfect game I really consider many first-person shooters in the modern era you know they respawn at the same point you can complete the whole game and do everything within a couple of hours and they focus particularly on the multiplayer a lot of that multiplayer aspect is really down to golden Ike's it was the first console game to really know multiplayer for player deathmatch and so you know all these modern games like Call of Duty Halo they owe a lot to gold night so what are your thoughts on the top five n64 first-person shooters are there any games that you really like and you think should have been in my top 5 then let me know in the comments down below or why not leave a video response and I always like to watch your videos and see exactly what you think until next time if you've got any suggestions for next week's top 5 Friday leave a comment below and thanks for watching"

know one unit of artillery is gone I've just got these two luckily it was a half to you that factly yeah the unicorn the unicorn's gone so it's just got to horse artillery add to the cords to go back here I have oppressed recorded it Dutch guard Lancers ab gorgeous as a Chevelle already good units and multiplan order to get the job done and they're really useful and reliable so now these two units are forwarded to seed formation meaning they can get more firepower off against these two musketeer units which are in two rounds previously three because they've lost lots of men they've now gone down to two so now you can see these three units of you lens charging down the bridge certainly go see it until late oh I don't I'd see it at the last moment but luckily they still do the body form square that with jumping action even though they're in the square already but I have by Dutch Lancers we were just looking out over there in battle down with them and my three have it SI units at our opening hi of the farmhouse which the Russians have decided to pilot too now these two units are getting nearer and nearer to the enemy you at how its is the back but i think i kill the unicorn sorry

I've got two good cameramen and pristine unit which is awesome 8 once I took on three light jog in unison only lost five minutes so now those two units done that I'm bringing around this Garcia says a shovel round on the right flank and procedure get in touch Lance is pouring over the bridge and I've still got my Fusiliers al I'm just standing there unfortunately by God semen is now around it so

        "transcript": "[Music] good day um my name is Peter Belling I'm a batch plant Foreman for bwa on the site I'm helping the Americans set up their batch plant and getting ready to batch the concrete for the the main Dam hi I'm Dean German um I work with ASI Constructors out of Colorado um I'm over here putting that batch plant up as you can see [Music] quite interesting when it's going it's going to batch lots of concrete so every day we want to batch uh 5,000 cubic M of concrete in a 20 hour thing cuz we're going to run 24 hours so 20 hours of concrete batching 4 hours of Maintenance and we'd like to get out that 5,000 cube a day um or better this batch plant here is an RCC plant it's roller compacted concrete is what it stands for um ASI built the first successful one in the states Dam out of RCC and we've been building them for 20 [Music] years 5,000 cubic m is roughly 2 1/2 2.4 ton per Cube so you you're looking at what 10,000 15,000 ton of concrete so it's it's quite a lot it's it's it's a lot of concrete I wouldn't like to be shoveling it put it that way you don't have quite as much cement in it um and it don't get as hot curing so it it's less cracking on it uh it's just a little better product for building dams with a whole lot cheaper [Music] we've got the got the Americans in one because this this style of batch plant's a little bit better than the ones we own as in the way it mix it's actually what you call a paddle mixer so it's got paddles inside that that mix the mix inside rather than having a bowl that spins around on the outside so you'll get a a better mix with this style of mixer for the dry concrete um the ASI guys that's what they do is they go around building roller compacted concrete dams so they they know their stuff when it all set up we'll have conveyor belts coming out of them holes right there we have three feed conveyors um they're going to feed up here on top the aggregate section the aggregate section then weighs up after it gets weighed up it goes up the conveyor belt up into a hold and Hopper up there the cement and fly as way up separately when the computer says it's time to dump it it dumps it in the mixer it'll mix for 35 seconds it'll dump out of the mixer into that Hopper down the Belt Line and out to the [Music] fill we engineered this plant in Texas um to fit inside conx boxes seat containers um it was all loaded in seat containers shipped over here and it's been trickling in for the past 2 months um we've been out I've been here for 8 weeks um just waiting on parts we finally got our last part last Saturday so we finally get to get stuff put up what what you see here now is only half of the setup this is one badge plant which you can run by itself but we'll have another one come in and set up perfectly beside it and it'll mirror this one and run side by side and we'll control that with one computer system so when um one plant's batched a load it'll drop it on the conveyor system and the other one will be be batching its load so it'll be a continuous feet of concrete it's going together pretty well uh we have a little issue here and there but it's going together we had it running once in Texas we had the whole thing up in Texas we took it down painted it and then loaded it in the containers and Shi it over [Music] here the safety over here is a um they have a whole lot more safety over here a lot more paperwork um it's not in a bad way um it's just a little different than what the states are and I'll take back stuff I'll take back stuff to the States hopefully within another week and a half we'll have it up and operational time we get a bit of electricity computer system hook up and yeah that's that's the basic gift of our batch plan the Australian people over here I mean all the guys I work with are good guys um everybody's nice everybody I have nothing bad to say about Australia it's it's nice country to come to it's very nice place now none of these guys are giving you a hard time oh they give me a hard time but I probably deserve [Music] it for"

rad 3 let me know if you guys want a review I was going to do a review but see my thing is I like to beat games before I do full reviews on games I think it's really stupid if you only play the game for five or 10 minutes or an hour two hours and you do a review on it I mean you don't really only thing you can review is on the stuff that you've played thus far for instance you could do a review on Modern Warfare 3 and say you hate the multiplayer but you could love the campaign how would you have known that if you hadn't played a full campaign see what I'm saying but um also my next video for those people that want games to play and you and you coming from my opinion I'm going to come out with a video called a holiday holiday shop I I don't know what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] I'm going call I'm going to name it something but it's just uh games to get for the holidays for yourself to enjoy before you know 2012 cuz after you know this year I think the games are pretty much done I can't think of another big game coming out until next year I think the next big game coming out is Mass Effect three which I will be getting that too also um I know I'm So Random right now I'm just randomly ranting but uh I'm also going to still be posting Skyrim I wanted to ask y'all since you guys said you wanted to see me play Skyrim what do you want me to create what I'll do is I will make a video show you all the races all the um powers that they have whatever hand to hand combat magic Mage whatever you want me to make and I'm going to follow it 100% whether you want to be super skinny a

        "transcript": "we include the resource file that we just created as a source file that will get built we're also going to be using some includes so we need to be sure that the search path will be included as well in the build we also need to add a couple of libraries let's go ahead and add those in as well so here you can see I have added the sam'l runtime lib and youyou idlib that's all we need to do in the sources file let's go and close that save now let's take a look at our see file nothing much here except a skeleton let's go ahead and add the includes that need to be added so here you can see I've added a few includes some are specific to the sam will run time em engine but I've also added 14 resource H because of the resource file that we have included next I'm going to go ahead and paste some code into win main we'll walk through the code to explain what it's actually doing so I've replaced the entire contents of wind main and here you can see I declare a few variables next we initialize the sam'l runtime engine then we're going to get a pointer to the singleton for the Sam will run time this is because there is a single object out there for the sam'l runtime we just need to go out and get a pointer to that object so we have something to work with now using that pointer we need to get access to the resource file that we included now that we've done that we'll go ahead and prepare some of the data structures for the client window including the title of the window fact that is an overlap window at 0 0 for the coordinates and here we're going to specify the specific resource that we want to access if I go back and open up the resource file again here we can see that the name is Amal if I open it up the specific resource within that is IDR underscores ml 1 double click confirm that yes that is indeed the sam'l code that we created earlier next we're going to go ahead and call an API to create the host window using zamel once we've done that we need to get a pointer to the root of the sample code so this call to get root element will give us the root of the sam'l at this point we're pretty much ready to go everything up to this point is more or less template code so it might look a little scary having this much code here however this is just all the set up pretty much will be used the same each time but now we need to actually access the elements within the sam'l so we're going to declare a button it's of type IX our button base pointer now we need to locate that within the sam'l to do that using that route object we got before we're going to call fine name on my button remember before that was the name that I gave to the button that we created next we need to create a event handler for when the button is clicked to do this I'm going to add a little bit more code to our project let's go back up to the top of our function and let's go ahead and paste in this class so I create a class here called button event handler it includes a method on click and what it will do is it will just display a message box that says Silverlight sample that's really all that happens here now down below back when we were before here creating an object of type button' event handler the class that you saw above i create a click delegate so now you can see here we make a call to create delegate in this call we will connect the handler that we created and here we can see that it has that method on click and we will call this click delegate create that object here now that we've done that we can take the button object that we created up above and connected to my button in the sample code and we can add the click event handler click delegate that we just created now that we've connected all of our delegates we can go ahead and we can call start dialogue which will cause the dialog to pop up let's go ahead and build this and see how it goes we can see that our build was a success and our application is now built now let's take a look at our application action so here you can see the windows ce e desktop on my device I'm going to go ahead and start the Silverlight lab that we created now you can see that the window is popped up here's our button that we added and when I click it you can see it does pop up a dialogue that says Silverlight sample just as we code it one thing to note here is that this is Silverlight code calling a native API let's go ahead and click on OK and see I click the button again and so on if you're wondering about the limitations of silverlight on windows ce e you need to know that the supported feature set is the same as silver like to point over the web in addition the performance of the Silverlight engine and applications is limited by the speed of the processor the graphics hardware and the quality of the display driver on your target hardware platform so how can I Daniel help add any oh is a microsoft gold partner and is the 2009 recipient of the system integrator of the year award in both americas and europe as well as training partner of the year for the americas we have extensive experience with all the tools we looked at today you can provide complete silverlight solutions quickly and painlessly we can also introduce you to one of our partner design houses that is qualified to do graphics design for user interface while we assist with the code behind that ties everything together this includes pouring your existing silverlight and WPF applications to silver light emitted we followed this model in the past create multiple customer solutions including the embedded systems conference keynote demo that was used to first demonstrate silverlight on Windows seee if you would like more information about a denio embedded our services or

Christie has open the scoring for middles BR well credit to Zill Nemo who did spectacularly well but it's Malcolm chrisy who's got the goal it's Christie's fourth goal for middles signing from Derby County and really we talked about a spark that's the Breakthrough that's just what we needed I mean we've had a let off we've had two let offs there and that's typical top them that we've had a good spell in the game we've not made it fair and now we should go on and go on because that's just what we needed well well done till neth it has to be said doesn't it it does but you've got to say the ball F I think it was it wilch was put the ball is a great ball but that's great play that he be disappointed not to score there but fair play chrisy coming in what a what a goal what a Finish Well wilshar and nth were two of the changes Steve MCL made for this game and well those changes are paid off immediately haven't they definitely absolutely brilliant now has gone down surely that's a penalty kick well Perry it is was having an absolute nightmare at the moment He Slipped for the previous goal now he's brought nth down through clean on goal and this could be a red card Jamie yeah I mean I hate to see it I hate to see people get red cards for that because he's he's yes it is I mean he's the last Defender uh you know there's no arguments under the current rules but it's still disappointing because you know he's made a challenge all lot being clumsy and it's disappoint to see players get a red card for that well here we see it again neemo is the final man isn't it he's the final Defender well I think he's a very unfortunate man there I mean you know just watching that again as neth goes through looks outside the box to me yeah it he has made cut that good I mean it's is difficult but he will take that all day long well it's a penalty kick janino to take oh Keller saved it but it's got him [Applause] now wow how unlucky for Casey Keller he made the save the ball stayed on the line well was that Brazilian arrogance or what this is janino again Juno's gone inside head up chich he's had a shot oh it nearly slipped in underneath Kell here with a shot now Nea oh that's another one well it's three in 27 minutes for Middle BR SAR nth has Justified his inclusion in the S he's run straight over to the bench it's now seven goals in 19 starts that's I mean that is unbelievable you just look there now you look at the to players and they're demoralized that is unbelievable they have completely completely just folded I mean it's unbelievable to see professional team just fold in such a way well zard neemo there had been some press stories about him in the week from when he was away on International Duty saying he wanted to start more he's certainly done the right thing today had a magnificent hand in the first king struggling to control that one neth is going to play macaroni and flager stay down macaroni oh it's number four for middles bro and mimo macaroni's only been on the pitch 5 minutes and he scored his eighth goal of the Season he's leading goal scorer for bar well we have started the second half much low we ended the first Jamie yeah absolutely brilliant again shot them all over at the back Taking Chances very sloppy defending but fair neth there he's you know he's won the ball and he's himself he's put madon in what a great finish I mean super for madoni well if Steve McLaren and the chairman and the chief executive wanted a nice way to send their fans off to the summer this has certainly been the afternoon for it has absolutely brilliant I mean you talk about wanting a convincing performance at home this has been brilliant this will be one that lifts the fans mimo macaroni there linking out well with zard nth credit again to the Slovakian and an excellent finish by the Italian a Tottenham free kick nonetheless chance for them maybe to restore a certain amount of parac back into the score the score line King leaves it comes in and it's in the top corner and it's a fantastic goal in the end jamy Redna has scored the goal that's put tan back up 4-1 the game you'll see on bar TV extra on Monday night at 6:15 of course if they are to stay in the Premiership next season so it should be another cracker next week this is janino again ball through to macaroni macaroni has made it five flag has stayed down there was a couple of anxious looks to the linesman but it's 51 Moon walking macaroni as well there yeah I mean it's 51 and where's it going to end is it six is it seven is it eight Tottenham are absolutely shocking m Aron's ninth goal this season for Middlesboro I mean that's not certainly we for midb because the football middlesbor played and you know the quality of the the movement and the position and the finishing has been superb well mimo macaroni has scored his second he'd be great for the Italians to get a hatrick here this even this afternoon and I think while you seeing the replays of masimo macaroni Steve McLaren's lining up a substitution I think young Stuart Downing could be getting a bit of a run out in this one great well taken goal by mimo so bad for I'm surey he just lashed out I think yeah I'm sure into macaroni again macaroni's toe poked it just past the post but I thought the Italian was on for his hatrick there's just a minute to be played at the end of this game a minute of stoppage time how close was this Jamie great run great ball and he's just poked it there but uh just the wrong side of the goal but again you've got to say toland I've never seen such a poor Premiership outfit"

        "transcript": "[Music] hi everybody Laura here in this lesson we're talking about camouflaging our D Cuts this is the card we're going to be creating today and it's very similar to this one which I just recently made for the latest release and I'm going to show you how to camouflage your D because now don't get confused with the word camouflage like as in military uh pattern of their uniforms not that kind of camouflage I'm talking about blending in making your D Cuts blend in with their surroundings so whatever kind of background you create today I am doing an ink Blended background I started off by masking uh using some postp masking tape and I masked off just the bottom par portion of my little front panel here I cut from some white card stock and I started off with Aquamist and then I'll go in with some Hawaiian Shores I'm going to kind of make an ombre Aqua look to the bottom part of this ink Blended background now you don't have to do ink blending for this camouflage technique technique you can use um all kinds of stamps whether you want to do stripes or polka dots or just disguise the limit for whatever kind of background you want to make that's the first thing you have to do is create your background now to make this even darker I'm going in with some tropical teal and the other card I used before I think I did Harvest Gold summer sunrise and berry sorbet and today I wanted to go more into the blues and a lot of people ask how do you get your ink blending so smooth well you can see here that it takes a lot of elbow grease a lot of effort you just you got to start light and work your way to the dark okay so once you get that all finished line up your dcut where you want it to go and I'm going to add a little bit of poster tape to hold that down I'm going to D cut that right into that ink Blended panel that I just did see how I D cut that right into there and then here is the piece that kind of fell out of it was left on the dcut machine so there you can see how that is perfectly matched up then I went ahead and dcut five or four more just white ones and now what I did was I turned over that panel and I'm putting some score tape uh I just want to make this I didn't take this backing off so I left that slick but now here that front side's real sticky so I can inlay one of those white hugs right back into there and then I'll take my Tombo mono glue and just put lightly put some dots of glue and begin stacking up my D cut to build up some Dimension you don't have to do four I just kind of like that thickness you definitely could just do two or three but if you want to really go big or go home you can go four or more and then when you're all finished stacking up your white D Cuts then you're going to add your one that's been ink blend Blendon and you can see here how it matches up absolutely perfect and I kind of made it pop out into the white so it's like half of it camouflaged and half of it's into the white but this is the way that you camouflage your D cut so now I'm just going to finish this card off by adding a little white embossed sentiment I'm stamping this is a coordinating sentiment from that big hugs Stamp Set I am absolutely in love with that big hugs all those you get five big hugs um dyes word dyes you get five word dyes and then all these really great coordinating sentiments that go along with the hugs okay so now I'm just adding a bunch of foam tape to the back of that panel and I will pop that up on just a standard size white card base and pretty much this is finished I'll just add my uh little sentiment strip here with some more foam tape and uh this really adds that nice pop of black on top of the aqua I'm into Cent sentiment strips if you haven't noticed I almost add sentiment strips on everything I do with foam tape of course and then once I get that adhered I'll stamp just the sending on top of the hugs I'm stamping that in some black ink so it says sending hugs to let you know I'm here for you and then just to finish it off a little something something I added three different sizes of sparkling clear sequins and this card is finished I love to see your take on this technique of camouflaging your D Cuts whether you want to create a pattern any type of pattern will work for this and then just D cut it right into there and then pop it up with some Dimension and give it a try have fun with it and I'll see you next time [Music]"

        "transcript": "24 hours 12 hours Chief Miller's called in mandatory overtime so since basically it the fire started everybody I think overall we've maybe had three personnel off at a time due to like doctor's appointments or you know they're trying to get child care arranged stuff like that especially with the large evacuation areas um but everybody's been here on duty nonstop and then when you're on duty you come back um that Thursday night we work till midnight and we came back and covered the district wow and that's for everybody that's on that shi so when you know we're out there work and we come back you're still on shift so we just you know just kind of switch hats and get back into the structure side of things and the EMS side of stuff so is it possible to get as much rest as you would want I mean I mean we came from the wall of fire and I'm I'm about wore out right now but I mean there's a lot of you really I'm sure like when it starts dying down it'll kind of probably catch up but I said like you go out there and it's uh you know I mean there's been plenty of stuff to do so but anytime you sit down it kind of catches up with you but you know the all the captains and stuff have been you know we've as soon as we have down time they like hey guys you know take your break they didn't know where you're going again guys have slept on the side of Miller Candon Road just to try to get a you know an hour of sleep where we can grab it um but basically a steady stream of caffeine sugar and food what is what everybody's uh I mean and the community has been great great as far as bringing making sure we're fed you know wanting to help out so I mean that's help too yeah you don't worry about crawling the fire as much as saving structures you know you're going around you you do what you can and you know the fire is going to it's going to go out sometime and once you start getting around and if you can find a spot to pinch it off like they did you know they do line and herur and stuff like that then you can stop it from getting exposed to other structures mhm but for the most part you you just you know the fire Starts Here stops here and goes over here and there's roads you're trying to tie it in and but it's usually uh you know save structures I mean that's the they call it point source protection at that point on the the local resource we kind of consider ourselves the local resources and then it's local guys yeah they're just basically the local guys um between basically the four agencies and then um I Know Chief Miller and them had activated the countywide mutual aid but for the most part at the beginning it was kind of just you know fry service the the US the local us for service guys and then BLM um that that went really well because we've all worked together so much a lot of us grew up together friends off duty stuff like that um but Chief Miller's done a excellent job of and like Communications but no matter how well you have a plan in place for you know Communications once that happens and there's you know such a large firefront that just you know Communications are probably one of the first things that break down but by through training and everything like that guys kind of know what to do so guys just go and you know you can rely on guys to do the job they were trained to do so this definitely ran a lot smoother from you know it's jump three different times and you can tell from the first time you know learned some lessons the second time was a little more dialed in and this last time it actually ran as well as it could have been I remember when they started evacuating in every evacuation plan and in every pre-evacuation plan all of us would say whatever yeah no way you know I live on by basically in s reserve and you know my wife calls and says well do we need to evacuate no way that's if it there's no way it's getting there and during the fire yesterday when I was at Ramsay in Campa belloo I called her and said leave I don't have to worry about you guys being there and it's just I never thought it would get get this far I really didn't you know what it is you have you'll see like when you see the smoke build up and when that smoke builds up and gets really dark it's all heat and you're getting all the leaves and anything hot that's coming off of that is uh getting caught up in all that they call the column and then when that column gets right across and it hits the road and it starts laying over the road it's taking all that heat over so a lot of it starts off of the the hotter it is the heavier you know the bigger stuff it'll carry and when it hits usually it's like it'll knock your hard head off I mean it's got it it's you know it'll generate I want to say its own wind but it's got a lot of energy with that and when it hits when it gets up to the road and and hits and you know it lays over the road and it throws all that all the Embers over and it's just like you know taking a bunch of matches out there and just flicking it and you get a bunch of little little uh spot fires and just grow together and they're gone and that grass fire made it it was standing see you know the Flames when they they'll lay across the road I don't know if it ever laid across 92 but when there's that much heat across it and starts throwing you know stuff that's burning material over that's you know spots across the road and you know some of the places it just you know the fire flat up will lay across the road and start the other side so I mean there's that's the whole point of you know you got the road and you burn out and you you make that that road you know half quarter mile long guess or wide is the way to put it I actually heard guy say man Ricardo's burnt down I love their food you know I love Mexican and um a couple guys would go to Knicks you know they had the the bike night and stuff like that and they would go there every now and then you know it just we didn't want to lose any more stuff you know we after the ash Canyon and stump you know we just said that's it you know we're not losing any we don't want to lose anything period you know there was guys that had grown up around here fighting the fire and you know when like Nicks and stuff like that you know like their hang out you know Tears in their eyes like man I can't believe this is happening here"

        "transcript": "this video will be dedicated to an extraordinary spider we know as grandma stole arroz eya a scientific name also called the Chilean rose the common name this fighter was first described by Walken air in 1837 the native habitat of the Chilean rose comes from the borders of the Atacama Desert in southern Peru and northern Chile but interesting enough this species is a bit unusual among tarantulas and that it occurs naturally and at least three different color forms sometimes also referred to as color morphs while enthusiasts thought that each color form was a different species even calling the copper-colored form grandma Stoller Kayla however over the last several years all of the several color forms have been reported to arise from the same exact strong evidence that these are all merely variants of the same species the lifespan of the Chilean rose species is somewhat undetermined the Chilean rose tarantula have not been kept in captivity long enough for us to make anything more than a wild guess at the maximum life span they've only been imported in many numbers since the 1990s but a reasonable guess might be 20 to 40 years that could mean that some of these Chilean rose tarantula as you see in your local pet shop may have hatched out of the egg sac from the late 1960s and that's amazing to me if the spider accidentally Falls the spider can be mortally wounded and this is a classic example of a tarantula losing its grip fortunately what I did here for a safety measure was that I filled this 10 gallon aquarium halfway with substrate filling the 10 gallon aquarium halfway with substrate will limit the space the tarantula has if it accidentally falls from the top of the cage I originally acquired this innovative concept from Rob's II to tarantula guy 1976 and basically it requires the use of two small disposable deli containers one acts as a holder and the other container holds the water when the water needs to be changed simply remove the second cup and replace with a new one for some reason these spiders do not burrow in captivity like they do in their native habitat maybe this has something to do with these fighters living outside of those extreme environments and they feel that it is no longer necessary to seek protective shelter anyways shelter should be provided in case the spider feels necessary for privacy being that the Chilean Rose requires very minimum humidity levels the cage should be kept with an open screened or well-ventilated top as with new world species the Chilean rose does have and will use its artic ating hairs as a defensive mechanism if the spider feel threatened or provoked I have only experienced my Chilean Rose disperse the urticating hairs once and that's documented on an earlier video when I removed her egg sac which she just spent the last 45 days protecting so now I'm going to cover a few guidelines when it comes to feeding your spider tarantulas are very efficient at processing their food and part of this comes from the low activity and energy these spiders expend so on this note you should only feed your spider once a week of course slings or baby tarantulas you can feed every two or three days overall the Chilean rose tarantula has proven time and time again to be a very formidable candidate for the perfect beginner spider they are Hardy they are docile they are inexpensive you don't have to worry about humidity like you do with most other tarantulas and they are common in the pet trade well at least for now my understanding is that sides-- is looking too bad the export of this magnificent spider and if this happens expect the prices to skyrocket just like the Mexican red knee the Braccio Palmas Smith he did in the mid 1980s so I hope this care sheet video has been some help to my YouTube viewers and good luck to you and thanks for watching"

        "transcript": "some uh defensive stances and offense things worked out well for second half I thought we kind of played U not up to what we want to play at our energy wasn't exceptional it was okay defensively I thought we played a good game all the way through contested shots some problems with our transition defense but that's going to happen this is a young team that can run the ball down the court quickly coach can you talk about as far as Kobe his shooting tonight as well as the assessment of B bam uh overall performance of your team and then again on the uh defensive I can't cover all that stuff have one one which one would you like feel uh you know I'm sure Kobe's not happy with this game I don't think he likes to shoot six for 19 and I know his free throw shooting is a uh consternation to him uh that he's not you know shooting the shot the right way and that's happen since you know obviously a couple weeks ago um he he's I thought he made plays I like the fact that he made plays out there he made things happen for other guys and that's the important part coach when they started to go at uh at you Westbrook seemed like they were doing some damage uh is that just a difficult matchup for you at this early stage you know uh I thought we did a really good job in the fourth quarter um you know obviously mayor was in there some of the time in you know he he did some good things out there but I thought they did a the team our team did a really good job stopping his penetration in the fourth quarter third quarter second quarter I thought he did some things that push the ball down our throat and we're going to have to watch uh that we take charges not just stand there and you know escort him to the basket as I say so between the injuries and and some guys coming back the lineup changing a little bit is this how it's going to be for a while you just need to sort of grind it out for a few games until you find that Rhythm well I don't know uh I really can't um speak to that issue as to what's going to happen this is what happened in this game you know I think that uh you know we know that we have to get easier baskets we know we have to get some easier scores out there um you know and that's an important aspect of our game is to look and to run and to get some easy baskets but we're not we didn't convert much at all tonight in the open floor and you know that's part that you have to have Phil with Kobe uh is he just not sharp or uh is he banged up and that taking a toll of him well you know I'll let Kobe speak for himself I know he'll be with you guys in a few minutes I think that he's worked on his shooting I think that some of his shooting has looked okay at times today um you know I was trying to convince him to take open shots when he had open shots uh looks uh were pretty good and and I thought that he tried to you know maybe Advance the ball a little bit too far at times on sequences down himself in the midst of very tall athletic guys that were difficult to finish so what you're talking about sounds like a guy with a little bit of a con confidence problem no I I think it's a rhythm problem more than anything else just a lack of playing the last what month or so just consistent play so I I think he'll come through Kevin Durant had a really rough night from the field uh which isn't typical for him how much of that was a team effort with schemes and everything and how much of that was Ron arest uh individually uh playing his defense well I thought the the team was much more alert as to where he was on the floor I thought they helped out uh you we tried to keep our arms out of there so he couldn't uh you know get the reaching files and send him to the line he still you know got there 11 times which is incredible but uh his his shooting was off today I think he'll shoot much better in the next game you surprised by B's um play after all the lofs so you know we we said yesterday the the Press people that were there at at our practice facility that you know it's been real encouraging to watch you know Andrew come back right you did say that yesterday to those members of the press that were there so um if they listen if you listened we were we were pleasantly surprised today pH talk a little bit just about that stretch of the fourth quarter with the the start of fourth quarter with the reserves yes that was a big bum for us to have the you know Shannon and Jordan come in and and you know get some action going and some energy in the game did you say anything to bind him though when he bumps into green it was a pretty good uh I guess cheap shot would be the right word the referees didn't see it everybody else in the play saw it did you see it which was the cheap shot the reason why Andrew went down or the reason why Andrew got up and bumped green uh bumping green I never saw any of other there's obviously a reason why he got up at so that was all right then well he wanted to make an issue out of it and uh you know that that's all right I mean you know he's he's saying you know I'm not going to stand around and get picked on and that's a that's a good sign for him are you disappointed you couldn't sustain after the first quarter you're up 14 or 15 is that disappointing to you like fli the switch was flipped for at least 12 minutes no uh you know I think that the the big thing about our team right now is sustaining effort you sustaining a full game we've been one of the better teams in the league in the first quarter uh we've been one of the better teams early and you know we haven't sustained the energy all the way through ball games this is something we're going to have to do in the playoffs"

        "transcript": "good YouTube how's it going everybody now before I get into talking about the team preview for those of you who have not liked my Facebook fan page which a link to that is in all of my videos as well as my Tumblr So follow me on Tumblr and go like the Facebook fan page last night I actually put a status saying that I wanted to do a 7,777 subscriber special and I actually hit that Mark this morning while I was at College doing some of the registration stuff because I am going to be starting College soon hopefully so I was doing that stuff and unfortunately I didn't get a chance to actually get a picture of me hitting 7,777 but I still wanted to do a special and I thought about this on the drive back home from the college that I'm going to and I thought to myself because a lot of you really like the stabmons the PS live and the Wi-Fi battle I had with Ryland I thought to myself why not do an hourong Showdown live of just stab mods with like two or three different teams that way the one team that I use doesn't get repetitive and boring for you guys and I don't really know if yall would actually like to see that which is why I'm bringing this up so leave a comment down below if you would like to see an hour live stabmons PS live and maybe I could get like Ryland in there and we can just have a good old time if he's not busy or something but yeah just leave a comment down below and if you would like to see it then just yeah say say you would say you wouldn't if you have better suggestions for a 7,777 subscriber special then please leave your suggestions down below but yeah that's really it uh Team preview this uh a weird team that I made it's really fun the only real thing I really wanted to use was Bandit sock and scarf Taurus because I really like those two then I threw in sub disable Haunter rain Den ludic Colo specially defensive purple pass and mixed defensive mandibuzz although I have recently changed it to Max Defense Max HP but yeah anyways looking at my opponent's team he has a hazard based team with Roselia and toal and looking at threats Haunter and Braviary are definitely going to be two problems especially if Braviary is the sub up set that could get a little bit out of hand if I do lose my mandot so I really have to watch out for that and actually this battle is against one of my subscribers that I found while I was trying to get battles with this team and uh there's actually a bit of a funny part to this battle before the battle even started as some of you know I do like wrestling don't judge me it's just something I used to watch with my dad and I still enjoy it to this day I don't really care what your opinions are on about it but for those of you who don't know U most of my Showdown alts are just basically wresters names and this guy put in the chat assist 6 foot hacks because I know that he likes to use the Riley Sprite because that is my favorite Sprite and he's alts are always named after wrestlers and I was like what what who who who would actually catch on to this but honestly it's basically the only type of alternate alt that I use on Showdown So eventually if you watch my battles long enough you will get the concept that I do just use wrestlers names and use the Sprite of Riley but anyways this is already 3 minutes long so let's get into the battle Yeah braier and Hunter threats anyways I'm be leading off on my Mandos as he's going to be leading off with the Roselia right off the bat I'm just going to go straight for the TA because I do not want him to get up any L spikes as this turn predicting him to switch out I'm going to go for the foul play as I do practically nothing to the sock juding for how much damage that Stone Edge did I know that this sock is more than likely scarfed because if he was banded that would have done well over 50% then predicting him to switch out into the toal of the brave are I decid to go for the to but he makes a safe play by bringing in the Roselia then this turn predicting him to go for lar spikes I'm going to go for the ton as he brings in the toal I'm going to be able to go for the toxic unfortunately he's going to end up burning me with the lava poon but you're going to see that I do get some justice later on in the game as his turn I'm going to go for the roost and he makes a very good play by bringing in the Kadabra knowing that I wouldn't go for the foul play he's not going to be able to Encore me into the roost but I do see The Encore coming so I'm going to switch directly into my Tauros and I do have the pursuit so I'm going to be able to Pursuit trap this Kadabra as he does try to switch out which means next time he does bring it in I will be able to knock him out because now his Focus sash is broken as he brings back in the Toral this is actually really bad for me because this is basically his free chance to get up stealth rocks as I bring in my mandibuzz I know that I could successfully just toxic stall this toal so I'm just going to stay in and I'm going to go for the foul play Then Roost up and just see what he wants to do as he ends up making a safe switch into the Roselia again I really have no reason not to go for the taunt but he does predict that and he's going to go for the sludge bomb which is 26% to me and unfortunately eventually he will knock out got my mandibuzz but I'm stubborn so I'm just going to stay in and I'm going to go for the roost as he brings in the Braviary now I found it a bit odd that he brought in the Braviary but as soon as I saw bulk up I was like  and that's actually why I went for the top predicting him to be bulk up because why else would you ever bring a Braviary in on a mandibuzz even Choice banded Braviary will not take down mandibuzz so I go for the taunt predicting him to substitute but he actually goes for the bulk up then I go for the toxic and I miss and he's a ble to knock out my mandibuzz so yeah my mandibuzz basically just got hacked to death and now I have to bring in my hunter disable his Brave bre and hope that somehow my Haunter will be able to beat this Braviary one-on-one because if he was toxic I would have instead brought in my PR pass which means I could have got on my rocks I could have just power jammed and volt switched accordingly to be able to get rid of this braier unfortunately though that is not the case and I have to bring in my hunter which is the next best thing that I have to be able to deal with this Braviary one-on-one because my hunter can easily disable the Brave Bird from Braviary and still be able to break his substitute unfortunately because I only got regular toxic on him he's only going to be taking 12% every turn as opposed to being toxic poisoned where his damage would be racking up every turn so I go for the Sledge Bon break his substitute as he goes for the Brave Bird then this turn thinking that the disable was so obvious that he would bring in Kadabra to Encore me into it I'm going to go for the sludge bomb but he makes a good play predicts that and goes for the brave bird knxy my Haunter luckily for me though it is a double down so I don't I no longer have to worry about the Braviary as I'm going to bring him aurus he actually ends up bringing in the cadabra and I don't want to give him a free chance to switch out because cadabra could still be a massive thre because it is very very fast so I pursue trap him as he brings in the sock nothing that I have left is going to take a hit from the sock so I just basically fod off my Ludicolo just because with him having Roselia Roselia can easily live an ice beam and knock me out with the Sledge bomb or even go for the and then knock me out as he switches out then switches back in so I bring in my Taos on the sock and he makes a very questionable play by leaving in his sock I don't know if you're predicting me to double on to my pro pass predicting him to bring in the Haunter but either way because of that misplay that gives me some huge momentum in this battle because I no longer have to worry about the sock whatsoever as he predicts my pro pass switching he's going to be able to knock me out with two hidden power fighting or two hidden power grounds allow me to now bring in my Tauros and pursuit trap this Haunter I get a crit which I don't know how much the crit actually mattered just because it is super effective I am adamant and Haunter does not have the best defenses around as he brings in the tal I am locked into Pursuit so I have to switch into my sock thankfully I do not get burned by the first lava plume and I'm going to be able to bring him down to a point where even if he burns me this turn with a second lava plume I can still get off enough damage with the earthquake to bring him down to a point where I can then bring in Tauros and knock him out with the return but I'm actually able to not get burned by both lava plumes knock out the turquo then knock out the Roselia with the crit which honestly the crit doesn't matter just because I could have then brought on Tauros and knocked him out with a return and that's going to be the narrow to of victory in my favor so that was definitely a fun game this is really the only battle that I have saved up right now because I've not gotten many battles on Showdown lately but yeah actually recently I've been active in the um YouTube chat on Pokemon Showdown when I am online so if you guys like want to challenge me on there then feel free to do so my ALT is 6 foot hacks with the number six spelled out because Tony decided to take the number six and just yeah whatever it's that happened like a year ago anyways if you enjoy the battle make sure to leave a like leave a comment subscribe to some more content I apologize for talking 3 minutes before the battle even started but yeah I've taken up enough of your time so I out of here let everybody"

        "transcript": "and today we're going to make a pizza that's very good for you because we're going to use whole wheat flour that's right and it's going to be called Pizza integral integral means whole wheat and so you want to start with some whole wheat flour and I want to show you the difference this is whole wheat flour remember the word beg bran endosperm and germ that's what's in whole wheat flour as opposed to this you see the difference in color between this it's more Brown looking and here we have unbleached allpurpose flour which only has the bee the endosperm it doesn't have the Bran or The Germ so this is really nutritious it's the whole wheat kernel and because we're using whole wheat today it works a little differently than unbleached allpurpose flour it's going to take a little bit more time to rise so how do you get around that you get around it by creating a mother dough a Bea as it's called in Italian or in English it's called a sponge and it's a dough that's going to give the second dough a little bit of Forza so here's how you make it you want to start in a bowl with about a half a cup of warm water and to that we're going to add a teaspoon of dried yeast so you sprinkle in a teaspoon of dried yeast and a half a cup of the whole white wheat flour this is whole white wheat flour it's a different strain of whole wheat and all you do is mix that around and this is your sponge you allow this to ferment for about oh 35 to 40 minutes it'll start to get bubbly and smell yeasty it'll increase in volume a little bit so once you have it all mixed you want to cover it and put it off somewhere in a warm place to rise so just cover it with a little piece of uh plastic wrap you put it somewhere warm to rise and when it's risen it'll look something like this you see here we have one that's very yeasty smelling see how fluffy it is and now that's ready to put together with our second dough so we have to make another dough so that's all ready so we're going to start in our mixer with a cup of warm water between 110 115\u00b0 is perfect and if you make a lot of dough you just know the right temperature of the water but if you don't then you want to get an instant read thermometer and put it in the water check to see that you have the right temperature again we're going to put a a teaspoon of dried yeast in the water and we're just going to mix that [Music] up and we're going to add the sponge so the sponge goes in put all of the sponge in remember this is our fortza dough the one that's going to give us that extra o that's going to help the gluten in the dough and then we have our unbleached flour or a whole wheat flour rather we're not using unbleached today here's our whole wheat flour and this is something called wheat gluten this is something that also helps dough rise and you can buy this in a grocery store just called wheat gluten so you want to mix that around and we also need salt because salt will control the fermentation of the dough if you don't put salt in the dough the dough is just going to run rampant so this will control the development of the the uh yeast and also provides the flavor and gives color to whatever you are making so you put the salt in and then we want some olive oil so for this I like to use about oh two tablespoons so two tablespoons of olive oil go in that's about 2 tablespoons and to help the yeast I'm also going to add some honey about 2 tablespoons of of Honey goes in see how easy this is and now we just want to mix that around get that well Blended and now we want to add our flour this is about two cups of flour I'm going to add most of it because I just don't know how much the liquid will take you you want to work the gluten a little bit that's what kneading does you want to work the gluten in the dough so you let it knead for you let it go for a few minutes and you're going to want to put it into an oiled Bowl so I'll put a little bit of oil in my bowl stop this and you see how much better that is it comes right off the blade and I like to use the paddle for this not the dough hook I think the paddle does a much better job and now we can take this out and you see it's not it's a little tacky but it's not really sticking to my hands so in the bowl it goes and we're going to make this even more nutritious than it already is by adding some toasted sesame seeds going to put some toasted sesame right in there and just knead that in with my hands and a trick for those of you who don't make a lot of dough or are afraid to make dough is to put a little oil on your hands put a little olive oil on your hands and that will help you not have dough all over your fingers so you want to get that kneaded a few minutes and then you've got to let this rise so you cover the bowl again with a piece of plastic wrap and you want to put this in a warm place somewhere where it's around 75 to 80\u00b0 is fine but don't go turn on the oven and then put the dough in turn the oven off and expect it to rise because it will rise too fast and then you won't get the flavor that you really want all right now that we know that I've made a risen dough for you and here it is you see how nice and fluffy that looks and now we can take this out because actually this is going to make two pizzas we can get two pizzas out of this and now you see how nice and fluffy that is"

        "transcript": "hi everyone daz here from mygreatandroid.com you might be wondering from the title of this video where we're doing a piece about nintendo 3ds and not about android phones as you probably expect i've got myself an invite to a pre-launch event for nintendo 3ds in bristol i'm for having to go along on my own i thought i'd take this camera along and i get the scoop for you guys too the problem is i'm fairly sure i'm not allowed to film in there so any footage i capture has to be pretty covert and so don't blame me if it's a bit scatty when i get back on the right the whole thing and give you a bit of a recap at the end so hopefully from now on this will be fun and um i'll see you on the other side straight through the foyer is a nintendo uh museum with old game boys um the first dual screens and uh the ds xl and here's the hologram uh there's got 165 000 views on youtube in two days on my other account absolutely amazing it did look pretty funky and what you can't see here is the sensor perspective that when you look above you can see above the box and when you look below you can see below the box inside it's pretty amazing so we walk up the stairs overlooking the museum and at the top of the stairs we can see what's about to begin to attractive ladies greet us in an eerily lit room all around the room uh nintendo 3ds titles being played on large flat screen tvs and uh in the background i can hear jonathan ross the nintendo 3ds is the first handheld console that can offer you the full 3d experience without glasses it's got radical new exciting ways of connecting to other players picking up new gaming information it's also got a camera the front and two at the back there so you can take proper 3d pictures which i've done a few and they're incredible and techniques of the wife teddy uh the kids the the puppies everything is gonna look incredible and i've already had the chance to play some of my favorite games on it uh zelda is out of this world um uh street fighter 4 the first 3d stream by the game is awesome any driving game on this great and pro evolution soccer thumbs up so jonathan ross has done his bit and the the screens turn themselves to gameplay and we get to see a myriad of games that will be launching on the 3ds the one thing i will say is that because the 3ds is a 3d device when you flatten the image down and you can do that with the slider on the device as well these the games they just look like gamecube games which you know is good enough i don't see a huge difference between these and standard ds titles they're not psp impressive to me and they're certainly not ngp impressive so unless you've got the 3d it lacks a certain something i think i speak for everyone when i say it's great to see pilot wings back um amazing game on the n64 love that and that's it's here mario kart also back on the 3ds getting a 3d treatment and this is kid icarus which was a cool game uh you know it looks funky for a low powered device so we are dragged into a darkened room to witness this strange display a real life reenactment of ryo and ken having a street fighter battle brilliant so this is why we came the hall each of these blue pillars is a separate 3ds with a separate title in each there's about two attractive ladies wearing all black for each guest so it was a strange experience considering they were continuously telling me off for filming um i tried my hardest to get you as much screen footage as i could and uh look around the device from all angles so you can see what it was gonna look like when you get one in your hands and it felt good real good to me this was one of the stars of the show it was the augmented reality tables uh the concept is fairly simple using the two cameras on the back of the ds you place a card down on the table the ds homes in and uses that as a plane of reference and then all kinds of crazy things happen um strange things jumping out of the table uh you can shoot archery targets you can shoot little monsters it was just a really nice new experience and this was the best thing about the day not the girl sky 3d absolutely amazing no glasses you can watch 3d tv in bed now who would not want to do that so that's a wrap brush it into a all white room with large tv screens showing all about uh spot pass which is the way nintendo uses wireless hotspots and lan networks to download software and notifications and allows you to play against your friends also in the room loads of white sofas and white netbooks to allow you to blog and tweet and facebook all about the experiences there and also on the screens any tweets that contain the nintendo 3ds event tag we're coming up on the the screen for everybody else to see so guys that was more fun than i expected um it was really modern really strange it was a full-blown expo nintendo really made me feel like i was a press member or someone special truth is i think it was just a really well put together pr but not to take away from the 3ds itself um actually hands-on playing with the 3ds for the most part i thought was amazing um for games like pilotwings and ridge racer i found the 3d a bit of a distraction and so i had to sort of flatten off using the slider for those games but games like street fighter for augmented reality seeing things popping out of the desk um and the shooting games amazing really really good fun and in 3d with our glasses is something you've just got to try the the absolute star show for me is sky 3d uh with no glasses on a handheld on a handheld device i didn't think i'd be getting anywhere near that for you know another four or five years and it really did work so i'm recommending the 3ds on the back of sky 3d alone so if you've got the 3d and you've got the hd package in your living room what better than what's with 3d tv in bed absolutely brilliant so will i buy one for 200 pounds which i think is what they're going for absolutely if not just for the 3d tv playing link up from the friends obviously that's going to be dependent on them getting a 3ds and not a ngp which to be honest with you is going to be a deal breaker because it has the two analog sticks which is sony listening to the end user after the you know the psp so from now on um all the videos you're going to see from me uh about android mobile phones most of them are going to be app reviews and please you know hit subscribe i definitely do have your help to begin with"

        "transcript": "hey there guys metal man here uh giving you guys a quick look at the mpow frigo bluetooth 4.0 headset uh this is a headset that i've been using exclusively uh recently and um let's take a quick look inside the box to see what we have so here's the headpiece itself i've obviously been using it already has the earpiece in it but let's get some of the other items out of here it's got a cool nice little leather bag um oh i think it's that it could be fake leather falling out but uh this thing is pretty neat because it has these magnetic strips right up the edges here so that when you have the bag open and you close it it kind of snaps shut if you have your uh head piece in here it's going to go ahead and keep it in there so you know it's not going to fly out and then i'll lose it also has a micro usb cable does not have a charger but to be quite honest with you i mean we live in a digital world i'm pretty sure you have a charger somewhere just go ahead and plug this in or you can use your computer laptop to go ahead and charge uh your bluetooth headset and uh here are two more of the adjustable earpieces that you can go ahead and use i already have one in place but it does have three sizes you have the small one the medium one and the large one i really thought that was pretty cool i mean people have different ear sizes different shapes inside the ear canal so you can go ahead and use whichever one fits best to make sure that it does have a snug fit for best enjoyment experience there so you also have your instruction booklet and you also have your uh return in exchange uh policies in case you have any issues then you got to go ahead and send that back so let's go ahead and let's take a look at the receiver and see exactly what we have here so first off this is a pretty standard looking uh headset i mean it goes over your ear if you have it set this way uh obviously it goes into your left ear and it has a very cool feature here where this thing turns 180 degrees so you can go ahead and have it into your left ear this way flip this thing over and now you can go ahead and put it into your right ear this way as you can see it's got some buttons here as well let's go ahead and zoom in so these are your volume buttons you have your uh turning it down and turning it up here uh these also act as your skip forward and skip backward buttons if you're using it for multimedia such as music or anything like that uh to be quite honest with you i found that a little confusing so i didn't even bother using it for that i just went ahead and used it to turn up the volume i mean you can also turn it up on your device so it's not like these buttons are necessary but it does act as an additional uh volume booster so if you've already turned it up all the way on your device you can still turn it up just a little more with this it doesn't make that much of a difference in terms of volume but it's just nice to have uh also microphone right there you see it the problem that i have with this microphone is that it's very close to the earpiece nowhere near your mouth which means you really need to speak up in order to be heard uh if you're going to use this headset for phone calls i strongly suggest it's used indoors maybe in an office or if you're going to use it in your car make sure the windows are up the microphone will pick up all kinds of sounds so it will make the other end of your call the person on the other side of your call complain about not being able to hear you very well so you more than likely end up calling back once you're somewhere away from the noise i tested this out while walking down the street and again you know just walking down there cars zipping by the wind blowing made it very difficult to be heard so strongly suggest this is indoors or in the car and i've already made mention of the earpiece so this thing comes right off you can just go ahead and put that right back on so you can go ahead and have whatever size you want there here is your charging port micro usb make sure you use either computer or uh ac adapter for that watch to say ac charger just go ahead and put the uh micro usb cable in here so you can go ahead and charge that up and here is your answer my phone call my pairing my turn on my turn off button uh one button all those functions uh the cool thing is that this is uh it has voice prompts so when you turn it on uh you will hear a voice you know and here's telling you that it's on if you hold it it will tell you that it's in pairing mode and when you turn it off uh again click it again it'll go ahead and tell you that it's off or disconnected from your device so some of the things that that little confusing regards to that button but the voice prompts really help and uh last thing is this nice soft rubber uh trim around the edges as you can see the shiny plastic there's no shine on this here because this is a rubber uh felt here that feels very good against your ear i use these during very long commute i use this during to it through a very long commute and um i've never had an issue where it hurts i mean i've had it on for up to four hours at once and and it felt very comfortable and even if you don't feel comfortable again just being able to switch it over to the other ear very easy very quickly and in terms of charging this thing charges extremely fast i plug it in through my computer my laptop about 30 to 45 minutes it charges from zero to max and it lasts for at least six to seven hours continuously listening to music so i really like that fast charging times lasts a long while very comfortable uh in regards to sound i mean this is a single speaker a headset so you're not going to get the best sound out of it but you are going to get a pretty decent sound i mean you can tell the lows from the highs so as long as it gets the job done i have absolutely no complaints very solid uh headset from mpow i strongly recommend you guys check that out so uh thanks for listening thanks for watching see you guys later"
