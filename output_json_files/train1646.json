        "transcript": "[Music] [Music] actually weighs about 15b you want to pick it up and feel see much heavier than Castle grey much heavier yes because it's Castle gry right I have that one pound yeah and um and you can see the level of detail that they did you know yeah they did a wonderful job and also the four personman yes I know they worked on the painting part painting they worked with him on uh the research the design cuz they wanted to get it just right you know well they knew they had to satisfy both the uh filmation community that where this is from and then the vintage toy line exactly so they blended it together and actually there's not there's no real reference for Snake Mountain if you look at every uh in the film it's always a little different yeah between the myp and the formation it's there's no real like set reference so what they did is they they because they're such a fan they brought it all together and tried to put every piece together to create an entire 360 design of mountain you know really and you fig the last time they even made a toy of snake Mountain was back in the 1980s let me show you the the level that they went through on the we went through on the design on the um even in the back you know the caves door the pool you know yeah this was always my cutest part when I saw it at San Diego last year I'm like oh my God that is so adorable look at all the detail that they put in you know the different faces it's it's different emotions for each one yes you know we didn't we didn't stick with with you know one one and then let just you know you really wanted to take it to the level where the detail came out in every part of the mountain you know every part you could just look but focus on one part and you could still get full DET on every part oh I know cuz I know I've just pre-ordered mine oh wonderful can tell I'm a big fan besides colle a very big collector yeah there you go I mean I can barely move this just so you can see the level that yeah I'm going to have to warn people that to reinforce the Shelf wherever they're going to put this yeah that's right and and like you can see when you put them together I mean the big size difference the big size differ it's still larger even though we have these um you have you have the castle gra go right now if we had it by itself it comes up to about here right so we did it with the accessory set is actually coming out um uh L March early April so should be in our warehouses by then but you can see with this s really builds up the castle gra but even putting them together you can see the Snake Mountain is still quite bigger quite bigger you know in scale cuz that's the way it should be right you know we could have done it a lot smaller but we said no we really need to kindy of keep a little bit of scale here with the you know B Mountain being yes you do and I'm glad you guys decided not to make this all the same color oh yeah cuz I remember at San Diego it was showing all the same color and it just Blended too much where it loses the detail yeah so we we try to go with the detail and even with the detail with you know the turrets and the Talon fighter this actually comes off right you put it oh just like the vintage toy you know and then have here so you can you can choose how you want to display it to give give you an option you know there's a lot of different options that people people can can do depending on how they want to display it right easily easily and I see you're continuing with your business set yeah so um actually we just re-released um uh the castle gra go because it sold out this sold out the cast gra C holder and the He-man right sold out but there was still a lot of demand people kept asking please can you you know we didn't as a Masters of the Universe fan I can tell you there's Mattel has held on to that license so precious that we've been craving it for over 30 years I know I know and and they're F I'm glad that Scott night like convinced people over at Mattel to release that this one is actually um a toy fair uh debut so this is the cast U the Snake Mountain business card holder so you can put your business cards in there and you can see that you know we also triy to stick with the level of design it's also former Horsemen also painted this um well you can always point out the four horsemen stuff yeah you can see already from a mile away and the nice stuff about it is again we kept it the line with the Skeletor right the second of the Le yeah letter openers letter openers and it fits right in there so that you know you can have both both the gra G and SN mounted on your desk now a few people um have asked will you be making the T as a pencil holders to go with it um that's still in the maybe doing the works yeah it kind of kind of kind of depends um cuz it does doesn't look right without the I know yeah that's true there's a that is one of the options that we're still looking at yeah we're still looking at this is the first thing that we'll be releasing with Shira is the um the letter openers so so you can see um and looks like a new sculpt it's a total new sculpt yes it's not the same and cuz I know a lot of uh people when you first came out with the he said oh it's going to be easy to do the Shir just put in the stone no no we did an entire so you can see how it's in scale right He-Man is larger I mean the faker the He-man all the swords were larger Shira is of course she's more still princess but you know it's it's actually and we it's an entirely new B and it is based on the filmation looks like and it's also based on the Mattel toy yes cuz I know the classic fly they mix both the cartoon and the um vintage toy yeah together uhhuh that's why this is more of the uh filmation influence MH because of the cutouts yeah and you can feel um you know the weight on that it is zinc alloy so it's just like just like the He-Man sword where was Zinc alloy you know and that's going to fit into the Castle graay St she took when she red it you know I mean all of them are interchangeable we're trying to make them so that they that's so they all they all you know go together easily now when will um people be seeing these coming out uh so Shir will be coming out um this one is third quarter this one is second quarter oh so this will be out soon this will be out soon so pre-orders should be coming out through uh um after Toy Fair finishes all the Distributors should have all of these starting to list yeah CU I know the"

        "transcript": "hey what's up everyone how you guys doing it's been a while now anyways getting to this for another tour visit the world sorry I didn't record the squad on xbox i actually i'm really lazy let's put it that way anyway I just wanted to show you the team i was using not that that's really important because basically it's all about Fernando Torres that versus the world here we have jordi alba crosses that lovely cross to Fernando Torres one in the 26 minute already so if you guys don't know this is about where one player just has a phenomenal five to six games and well five to six games and out of that would choose like the three to four best games he's had in that and I just really didn't expect that was actually making a series called tiki-taka and it just wasn't working I would do some lovely girls tiki-taka but just wasn't getting the results so in the end I noticed for nonferrous had a phenomenal game and he is just playing exceptionally well who is the 82 ready there's only 79 pace I think no 72 base is something ridiculous i forgot and but he just does not feel like I think he has a special attribute of like nine eighty something agility or I don't know which you clearly can see because he is just phenomenal and here's a really shitty mistake from the goalkeeper bags I think that's four goals or was it three and yes to bag the other one I can't remember because I hadn't guessed us that would sit on the benches well I completely didn't show them in the squad not that that really matters anyway and for another Torres if the one goal as you remember that little kill that little camera like to muck around with when doing these ago series so basically this isn't the best man of the sorry this isn't the best Fernando Torres versus the world or any to be honest sorry versus the world because I've taken three to four days off if you I've taken three to four days off work and I wanted to use that to relax and not do any youtube videos in case you're wondering why I haven't done one in ages that is why but then today's my last day relaxing i had already recorded this but i had to change the commentary as i had done this a week ago and i totally forgot to upload it so here it is and this is probably not the best compared to what ronaldo vs the world which has caused some screamer some screamers in that especially that rainbow flick from the corner and smashed it in and the halfway line goal that was a really good episode and then the name I want is very skillful as well this is a striker that doesn't have the best pace and best attributes all round so it's very hard to do those kind of goals but nevertheless I thought it was a good way to you know just kick start my little break and show this one little thing because I want to try also a defender versus the world as well now maybe in a couple of months or so this is my series in one of my series anyway versus the world so I don't know tell me we think about this one this episode is a little difficult because like I said not the best of goals but it's his goal to game ratio as you saw earlier he had 10 games 16 goals overall and you can see here he is on fire and he is just a such an Opie players like a hidden gem everyone knows who he is and if he can afford him anyway but to me he's not like I'm not saying like oh he's gonna change your whole you know cuz I mean some people you have used Torres and not had this luck maybe you could say or had this kind of form whether some people are good with certain players as well remember that also the team I built around him wasn't exactly 10 million was it the team I had used currently was the only person I was missing a Sylvan he's a hundred K and I used the game without silver a lot of time so I mean it's totally fine you don't need an expensive team and sometimes it's like that you you know you can use the player it's normal you may even say in the comments tourist sucks but for me he played well in this game with the 43 he scored 2 and played a big part in both of the other girls so um nevertheless is moving to the third game he is just a really fun player to use I'm not gonna live only he had like 90 pace like was a fifa 11 fifa 10 we was 92 rated i was unbelievable i hadn't played ultimate team on that whichever one it was 1110 i don't know but nevertheless he has been a really good purchase for me and it's funny how i discovered him during a ticky-tack a video which failed for me there was a nice little header there from him himself and yeah i hope you guys look at it from a different point of view because a lot of people are most probably clicking on this video thinking okay there's gonna be some amazing goals like the one run out over the world or maybe the name our one but i don't know it's definitely not like that but from a strikers perspective it's not bad you mean few goals outside the box and I swooped few skills and long shots it wasn't that bad but it's just mostly a video I can just get out there discuss why haven't been uploading it's just I really needed a break you know I can upload consistently just want a little break and relax I've made a few teams for myself as well and just because I have not done that once really more than once or twice just wanted to relax and make some teams I wanted to play but the next episode will be Aguero verse the woman I assure you that be a much better episode it's a 90-second inform Aguero as well and we might get some player reviews in and I'm gonna do a special video tomorrow which is a squad builder of all the opie players on FIFA and it's nice i'm not gonna lie i mean the chemistry may be a bit down for others but it's not necessarily you have to look at it as a squad builder point of view like oh I'm gonna make this exact team is to show you um who are the most overpowered players and you can go and pick one or two of them out yourself and try them out in your own squad builder something like that just a little thing on the side now and obviously it's you can make that team that the links will be pretty crap between each other and I'll show some goals from each player and some highlights so you know you can just get a quick overview idea of it like a quick squad player review and yeah that didn't what kind of made sense so stay tuned for that I'm pretty sure this might might get quite a few dislikes because it's not my type of video i do i usually do i feel i do a little more entertaining than this but if i was watching this if i was in if i was one of the subscribers watching this I would I wouldn't have found it boring but I wouldn't I may be a bit skeptical thinking why did you do this episode it wasn't as entertaining but you know just look at it from a point of view where he just absolutely destroyed the opponent because he did he played really well for me let's put it in that side of put it from that perspective because he played really well for me and I'm I just hope he gets a nice little inform may use him he could be good as a cam maybe I maybe that's I don't think so i don't know maybe we could try them their next time but as a striker he's really good thank you very much for watching us I'd wait to see with anticipation how many likes this gets thank you very much for watching and stay tuned for more videos i'm done with my break thank you very much"

        "transcript": "what's going on dc fans undertame gaming here today bringing you some news information and updates surrounding the upcoming batman vs superman dawn of justice movie now of course comic-con 2014 is over and we got our first little teaser our first official look at the batman vs superman movie and of course when i saw the footage uh that was recorded by a cell phone i was just blown absolutely out of the water now of course to do a little synopsis and a quick little review we saw batman pretty much turn on his bat signal and as he was turning it on of course it looked like a very grim and dark atmosphere in the city and whatnot so as uh bruce wayne turns on the uh the bat light of course he looks up and as he's looking up towards his bat signal lo and behold the lightning strikes the bat signal quickly disappears and standing right on the shadow right behind the bat signal is superman flying just staring a hole into batman now batman looks absolutely incredible his eyes were glowing like this bright blue you know whitish color superman's eyes were glowing red and it looked like those two are just going to have one of the most intense battles of them all of course now the synopsis in the story for batman vs superman dawn of justice is gonna go as follows now following the events of man of steel um ben affleck's batman is pretty much going to hold superman accountable for all of the destruction and the chaos that happened in metropolis of course now um you know they're gonna eventually form you know this epic partnership together and pretty much establish the foundation of the justice league now uh wonder woman is going to be in this film of course now the rumored villain for this movie is going to be doomsday apparently uh they're going to have you know uh legs luther be in the film as well so lex is going to be in the film um but as for doomsday doomsday is going to be a villain that's going to be teased perhaps uh there is a lot of rumors going around that doomsday is going to make a special you know one time only appearance where he's gonna be a setup for the justice league to go on ahead and fight him later on down the road so um we actually got our first look at wonder woman and she looks incredibly beautiful now of course wonder woman looks a lot more beefier uh than the one that we should we were seeing at comic con but uh nonetheless the wonder woman that's going to be played um in the batman versus superman movie looks absolutely incredible she reminds me of xena warrior princess i mean she looks really really cool so um the way she's building that sword the way her beauty just mesmerizes you know and just reflects off the of the actual poster it looks phenomenal so batman vs superman is going to incorporate batman superman wonder woman and flash flash is gonna have his own little cameo as well um but this is gonna be absolutely phenomenal i mean we have an incredible cast of uh amy adams ben affleck of course now we have you know henry cavill playing superman holly hunter you know jeremy irons and whatnot so the film is going to be really cool now i know a lot of people are going to go into this and say well you know the avengers 2 is dropping in 2015 and the only reason why they were so afraid especially for zack snyder to drop the film in 2015 was because they were afraid of having to compete with the avengers 2. now honestly at first i was really suggesting that the avengers 2 is going to blow this movie out the water now i'm not so sure because after watching that little teaser the way the music was set up you know batman having just to stare a hole into superman you know this ominous feeling and having to have superman look at batman and superman looked like he wanted to kill batman it was just insane because he was standing he was actually flying hovering right above him and he looked like he wanted to blast batman with his freaking eyes shining all red and whatnot so this film is gonna tell an amazing story the release date is may 6 2016 so mark it down on your calendar may 6 2016. now we're going to be getting more teasers and more trailers as the months roll on in i just want to give you guys a quick synopsis on the actual teaser that was shown you know um batman having to set up his bat signal and then right behind the bat signal uh behind the shadows was superman just flying hovering over him just staring a hole in him now of course i'm a little i'm a little concerned on the direction in which wonder woman and flash are going to be having um in terms of this film now i think that they're personally throwing in way too many characters into this film if you're gonna have batman and superman fine why not have one more fine throw in wonder woman but we don't even know if green lantern's gonna make a cameo we don't even know if you know you know the flash is going to be an important role that he's going to be playing as you know we don't even know if martian manhunter is going to make an appearance either but the biggest rumor of them all is doomsday doomsday having to have an appearance or a small cameo now he is a villain of course now they did mention him a little here and there but i'm pretty sure they're going to focus more on lex than anything else and then probably after lex luthor they're going to probably focus on on doomsday but doomsday is going to be the opener for the justice league because the justice league as they form they're eventually going to have to team up and fight doomsday now that right there just sets up for an incredible battle because doomsday is pretty much unstoppable you know so having a story you know you know like the one that they're going with now with superman holding batman accountable it's it's going to tell an amazing story it's going to captivate the audience personally that that's what i feel so uh let me know what you guys think in the comment section below about batman vs superman dawn of justice do you guys think this movie is going to be better than the avengers 2 age of ultron or not i want to know what you guys have to say in the comment section below guys like i said batman vs superman dawn of justice did not attract me whatsoever i felt as if you know when i first when i first heard about it i was like well they're trying to be more like marvel but now now i am sold on the fact that number one they're gonna have doomsday which is my favorite villain from dc number two they're gonna incorporate batman fighting superman in the first film you know having that whole story ordeal and based on the teaser it it just it blew my mind so and number three eventually they're gonna have you know the justice league you know assemble or whatnot and battle all sorts of enemies so that's gonna be pretty cool having aquaman and martian manhunter and whatnot so let me know what you guys think thank you all for watching uh once again everybody if you guys are dc fans don't forget to subscribe to my channel for all the latest marvel and dc news information and updates if you guys liked the video don't forget to hit it up with a like and a favor leave your thoughts in the comment section below guys what do you guys think is going to happen in this film how do you think batman is going to encounter superman and how exactly do you guys think this is going to play off do you guys think the fight teams are going to be long short let me know thank you all for watching everybody once again stay tuned for more because there is more news and updates headed your way i hope you all enjoyed and i'll be seeing you all in the next video take it easy everybody peace"

        "transcript": "[music] Hi guys, it is Louis Smith here. You have joined me in the gym and\nI am going to try and give you my top five wit tips for training\nand trying to be a high level sportsman or just even having fun. So, the first one being is dedication. Obviously, it is going to\ntake a lot of hard work to get to the top or to get to reach your\ngoals. For me, you know, I have dedicated twenty\nyears of my life to the sport. My mom has dedicated a lot of hours, taking\nme to and from competitions and things like that. So, It has been a lot of\ndedication involved, no just from my part, but from others as well. My second top tip, for gymnastics or for training\nor sports or whatever it is that you want to do is hard\nwork. What you put into\nyour sport, or your hobby, or your job, is what you are going to get\nout of. So, you have to put in the hours, you have\nto put in the hard work. It is not going to be an easy job to get where\nyou want to be. It is a necessary thing, and it is an obvious\none as well. So, hard\nwork is my second tip. My third top tip, is targets. Having goals. As a gymnast. We have always\nbeen set targets and goals. And, realistic goals as well. There is no\npoint going out there and setting something a bit ludacris. So make sure\nyou set your targets. Know what you need to do to be able to achieve\neach step and each goal. And then, obviously make you next goal and\ntarget realistic as well. So, my top tip for number four is, sacrifice. If you are willing to push\nyourself to the next level and really start taking your sport or whatever it\nis, what you are doing very seriously, there is going to be a level of sacrifice\ninvolved. For me, I spend a lot of time away from friends,\nfamily, and going to competitions abroad. Going to training camps, sacrificing nights\nout and parties, and things like that. All with the end goal, knowing where I wanted\nto be, which was the Olympic games. So, a big part of being successful is being\nwilling to sacrifice. My last and final top tip, from my top five,\nkind of, hints, I guess, would be, to have fun. You'll see videos of me training and stuff,\nand having a lot of fun, during training. Obviously, there is a time and a place, and\nobviously we take certain sessions more seriously than others. It is important to enjoy what you do, and\nto make yourself want to carry on doing it again\nand again. For me, I think, to top it off,\nis to have fun. As much as you can, and really enjoy yourself.

very good with me that's and yourself I always ask you that cuz I have to know how you are yeah everything's going okay you're not all right this interview cannot continue no I'm I'm glad to say we can continue everything everything is as it should be uh brilliant uh fight week now tell me a little bit how Derek's preparations going obviously hard work's done now as usual um no injuries and um his head is good and um yeah training's gone really really well he seems in a good mood today last last week we caught him he was just after 10 round a heavy sparring he he seemed a bit tired and didn't really want to be at the press conference to be honest yeah I mean look Fighters uh if you go around the country which you do you know interviewing Fighters they're all like you know it's a very difficult thing to do you know um to get your head around all the different parts of uh of being an athlete and you know obviously this is a part of it where Fighters have to talk to you guys you know um so sometimes you're going to catch a fighter you don't know what's going through their mind you know um so yeah hence why sometimes you see Derek you don't know how to um what mood is going to be in I'm sure every fighter around the country is the same they're um unpredictable yeah what are you expecting from Kevin Kingpin Johnson um anything he brings you know when you go into battle you got to be have an open mind you know um the same way we're training um making Provisions for him he's also doing the same you know making Provisions for us you know how he's going to tackle Derek Tora and um yeah we've got we've got good plans for him UK audience is already aware of him having F Tyson Fury um as well as being in the prize fighter do you think you gave a good a good account of himself every time he's been in the UK well most definitely because you know he's well schooled he's very experienced and is boxed at a very high level so you have to respect that and recognize that um yeah but like I said we've um we've made Provisions for him we believe we we've got what it takes to to to get a victory over him was the late change of opponent kind of late change of opponent hindered your plans or anything sparring wise did you have to change anything mix it up a bit yeah I mean look you know we've been here before you know like I always say first time it happens to you as an outfit you're kind of a bit thrown but as as you get more experience like we have now you're able to make the adjustments to able to to cope with the the late L change of a of opponent I know this is the heavyweight gym but this piece of equipment here next to you is taking the Piston there's another one bigger wow um I mean that's the way we're not the the only ones doing it that's the way training is going these days we're going back to the core M all the core natural um well the tire is not natural but it's part basic a very basic um Tot but you can do a lot with it you know yeah do a whose bag would that be in the middle cuz I'm seeing some normal siiz bags here and I'm seeing one giant bag there that very bag is actually named after Derek that's a der or bag the Debo bag that's our secret weapon that bag seriously that bag was \u00a300 I don't know if you can see how big it is in comparison to the other bags in the gym but it's um it's pumped that's our secret weapon um that's said 300 over 300 lb that bag weighs and Dereck is probably one of the few people in this uh boxes been shift that back to make it move what's going on um some of your other boxers talk to me a little bit um Ian Lewis and how's he looking yeah Ian Ian's got a fight coming up um in April against John McMan and then we're current in training for that and I'm excited because as you know you know him very well he's a kid that um he going to do great things in the future I really got a lot of Hope on him he's a very talented guy very respected from the amateur he's going to do it now he's going to do it now time is not on anyone's side he's got to he's got to do it now and I've um told him this he has to really stand up and be counted otherwise it's just going to go for Waste um I read an article recently that you and W kamacho have now parted ways MH um could you talk to me a little bit about that was it an amicable split what's kind of happened here well it's kind of as I say I'm so baffled you know cuz I thought we were getting on really well I thought we were doing really from my side um he called it so you know I wish him all the best he called it he he has reasons to say that he wanted somebody who could give him 100% well I was given 120% plus so you know let him go and get 100% uh that he's looking I'm willing to give 120 plus if needs be which I believe that was doing from my side so he knows better than I do so I'm not really me cuz he's a really nice guy yeah really really nice person but we're talking boxing here so good luck to the boy know I wish him all the best in the future I mean I've got listen I've got a big Camp here and you know I want the best for all my boys okay and I still wish him best in his care I hope he can remember all the things I've shown him you know and take them on board to further his career and I hope the next coach can understand what I've given Wy and trying not trying to undo them because those are the things I believe that will take Wy much to where he should actually be he's a very talented talented boxer and um if he does those things and perfects them in time he will reach his death to me okay Don I appreciate that very honest answer um we got the press conference on Thursday so I look forward to catching up with you and Derek then no doubt you get a chance to have a look at Kevin Kingpin Johnson as well I don't think you're expecting too much change I don't think he can change his his genetics or make up listen we're we're always prepared for any eventuality if he decides to change his character overnight we're prepared for that all right listen the person you got to worry is about Derek was he going to be like on Thursday we don't know Derek doesn't even know what D's going to be like on Thursday is he still as unpredictable as always yes they're a bit more controlled now but yeah still unpredictable doesn't seem as stubborn as he once was maturity yeah age gets to us all done AG gets to us all abut no one is exempt from it indeed indeed sir I want to thank you for having me in the gym today give me a bit of time and uh yeah I'll see you thur day by the gra of God [Music]"

        "transcript": "hello and welcome to bro jeel this time we have real bows this is a mod that replaces the models of most of the generic bows in the game there's 12 new models in total ranging all the way from the ancient Nord bow to the orcish Bowl the idea behind the mod comes from an author who's also a Craftsman and in his experience he thought the vanilla bowls looked more like Hollywood props rather than functional bowls while the new models aim to change that and the author's also taken several other key points into account when designing the bowls for example he's taken the material type and its Origins so things like How It's Made Who it was made by and its original purpose and then he designed all of the bows around all of that information so as an example let's take a look at the new Ebony bow it's now a composite bowl with a Twist the horn has been replaced with a strip of tempered Ebony instead of just wood ebony is a much stronger harder material but it's also relatively lightweight especially when focused into a specific area of the bow the end result means you can draw further back without snapping the bow allowing for more powerful shots now we're hardly bow experts or craftsman but it does seem more logical to focus the stronger material in certain areas of the bowl instead of just using a single material to Encompass the entire bowl like in vanilla the mud also steps away from the vanilla design where the bows have to follow the weapon type's theme even if it doesn't make sense in terms of functionality for example you all know that the Elven bow is very sleek and stylish and also made from Moonstone and Quicksilver those design choices are key to the Alvin weapon type so the bow sticks to it even though it might not be the most practical bow design the mud spin on the alven bow is completely different but it's still very sleek and stylish it's the longest of the new bowls and made from long strips of layered bamboo it's also laminated with a cherry finish to give the extra few style points that the elves deserve when you're using the bowl you still very much get the feel that you're using something Alvin especially when compared to other new bows the same goes for the other models you can definitely tell when something feels foreign and you can generally guess where the bowl came from on The Mod page you'll be able to read about the design choices of each Bowl so you'll be able to see why the author chols a certain material or why a bow looks a certain way here's just a few more examples of some of our favorites the FMA has an unusual curve to it and that's because as you know the Fulmer are cave dwellers so when they harvest wood they use the trees that grow through the walls and ceilings of their caves and as you might know trees will grow towards sunlight even if it leads to weird curved shapes the Falmer are an unusual almost foreign Race So an unusually shaped bowl fits them perfectly the new Imperial Bowl feels very manufactured and to the point it's a composite Bowl using very standard and generic materials a hardwood core a horn and an animal-based senu the limbs are also wrapped in Rawhide to protect the bow from the harsh weather while on patrol there's nothing overly special or unique about it and you definitely get a feel it was designed for mass production in mind the Dwarven bow is made from a lightweight D alloy with longevity in mind it has a hollow handle and solid metal limbs while also being designed to never require maintenance it bols wayer efficiency and finally there's the dric bowl it's similar in construction to an ebony Bowl but the ebony is treated with the D heart which causes it to crack D blood then seeps through the cracks and solidifies in the heat creating a much more rigid let still flexible material it's also said that the sen you use to enhance the bow actually comes from Fallen D instead of an animal so the bows themselves contain the vge of the DAT used to create them making each one rare and unique it's also important to keep in mind that although the stories behind the new models are interesting and certainly more unique they don't actually behave differently in game so their stats remain the same which means it's compatible with any other balancing mods or overhauls it's also fully compatible with Skyrim redon and perus Maximus because of the optional files and speaking of optional files each new B model is completely optional and can be separately installed during the installation wizard so you can easily pick and choose the ones you like in the end even if you aren't interested in all of the backstory and design choices the mud still offers a refreshing new spin on the vanilla bowls so if you're interested

        "transcript": "and now it's time for a preview of an upcoming game by Tom vassel hey folks I like Pirates and pirating games and though I guess I don't look much like a pirate here look a bit more like Mr smei uh but today we're talking about a game that's currently on Kickstarter called Privateer this is a game in which of course you can be a merchant in this game and go and deliver goods and get some money that way but you're going to get so much more money by finding exotic relics and by fighting other pirate ships let me show you how the game plays and then we'll be back with all my previews I have to say that everything that you see here is prototype form and so things may change well things will change many of these things by the time you see the final thing what we're doing here is we're just trying to give you an idea of how gam playay Works each player has a ship that's their color that they're going to place on the matching port and this one happens to be in cardia and there's six different ports on the board and each player is going to start with a captain players are going to have a a thing here uh which keep this is your ship essentially and so you go pick a captain that you you'll get two and you'll get to pick which one that Captain will give you a special ability also he'll add one to one of your your stats for example blackbart here adds one to your cannons nedo adds one to your crew Calico Jack and I mean you're going to pick them maybe based on that but also probably based on their special abilities like this guy here can sell goods for an additional uh a coin and so players going to be keeping track of their stats here now the top stat here is how far you can move each turn so you start being able to move at three But as time goes by you'll be able to move farther up to nine spaces on a turn crew here affects some of the cards that show up so the higher crew that you have the better those cards will help you and you'll see that in a moment the Cannons here is helpful in combat and this shows how many different cards you can have of uh Cargo in your ship so everyone's able to have three cars at the beginning but if you if you fill your cargo all the way up here you'll get nine now every time you increase one of these you get an infamy there's a cost to increase these as the game progresses you'll see that cost 2 4 six again again it's much more expensive but each time you move it up you get an infamy and when you get to the last one you get a bonus of two infamy infamy is marked on a track here next to the board and so You' be moving it up there you'll also notice that there's several Goods here uh there's rum sugar paprika tobacco cinnamon and fruit these goods are sold at each of the different ports for different prices so you're able to go to different port here and maybe cinnamon here is sold for three coins now each PA is going to start with 10 coins and maybe you you can you can always go around and buy goods from one port and go sell them at other ports to get money so that you can buy your upgrades but you can also attack other ships if you are if you move into a spot where there's another ship or you move into a spot where there is a merchant ship on the board you can attack them first a merchant ship the merchant ship rolls two dice as defense you roll one die plus your Cannon value so let's say I attack a merchant ship and the merchant ship rolls a six I have a four Cannon value I roll five nine I've beaten the merchant ship at that point you roll a special die to show what kind of cargo the merchant ship was carrying that one happen to be carrying tobacco cuz it's yellow since I got a nine and they got a six I get to take three tobacco cards however I can only take that if I have enough room in my cargo hold to hold it so even if they roll two and I roll 12 um I might be able to get the difference I might be able to get 10 cargo but I might not have the room for it when you attack another player you'll just be able to seal steal the cargo that they have although in this case both you are going to be rolling a die and adding your cannons when moving on the board you move from one square to the next Square remember this is a prototype the ships here are are bigger than the squares but let's say my movement is four I go one 2 3 four like that you can't move diagonally however you have to watch where the wind is blowing if the wind is blowing with you each time you spend a movement Point you'll go an extra spot you go twice for each moving point at the same time if the wind's blowing to the South and I want to go north I have to spend two movement points to go one space North so it's harder to go against the wind and easier to go with the wind at the beginning of each turn players are going to draw a bounty card these Bounty cards can have a variety of things happen one of them you change a new direction for the wind you get to pick which wind it is many of them have to do with your crew uh here each player is going to roll their crew and you so you'll roll a die and add your crew number to it the highest score gets a free upgrade and then you get a free upgrade so that's pretty cool many of the cards in this in this deck are relics which you keep them and they add two to your infamy so they're worth points many of the relics are but there are many cards that other players can take some of the relics don't add points but give you special abilities this adds crew to your cannons in combat here's another sacred icon adds two here's a map where you get one for each map you control so the more maps the more points if you draw this card cut purse you can steal a relic from another player or trade purses with another player um purses where all your money is see the nice little purse you have here and here you can select The Relic controlled by each other player all players blind bid for control of each Relic in the order that you choose so these cards are going to be drawn each turn then a player is going to move then a player is going to attack and or sell at a port if they're at a port they can sell the goods there for whatever price they want at that point the card for that Port is discarded and a new card is put in its place so the prices are always changing at the different ports and then players will also be spending money to upgrade their ship once a player has reached 20 infam whether it be from relics or upgrades to their ship that player has won the game preter works really well for many reasons one of the reasons is the game is very quick you take your turn you draw a card you move you do you do it maybe an action and then it's the next person's turn so the game plays very quickly and there's four different stats in your ship so it's interesting to see which stat do you want to fight people a lot well you'll be constantly building up your Cannon to go around attack Merchant ships and or the other Pirates do you want to uh get relics and cool things from the deck then you increase your crew um do you want to be a merchant to go around you can increase your hold and of course everybody wants to increase their speed you can't increase all of them you don't have nearly enough money to increase all your stats as the game progresses but it is something that allows you to basically customize your ship also you kind of play off the special ability of your pirate uh Captain who has that special ability so that kind of does it so the game is back and forth very quick I think that families would really especially like this one because it's really easy for everybody to get into and it gives you a lot of meaningful choices where where do you want to go on the map which ports you want to go and sell things to which do you want to attack some merchants and get things and sell or would you like to go get those from other Pirates and sell them and uh what are you going to do with the relics who you stealing relics from game is not a very long game I would say 30 to 45 minutes will often happen in this game especially if players are somewhat aggressive and go out and trying to get stuff done so if you're interested in this game if you want to be a pirate or Privateer which is the nice way of saying pirate um then the kickstarter campaign is going on right now and I'll show you a link right here [Music] thanks for watching our review today for more information about board games as well as the number one board game audio podcast check out dice tower.com for reviews

        "transcript": "their service in the Twin Cities has issued a tornado warning for Northwestern indicating it was expected to develop shortly a tornado watch remains in effect until 8 p.m. Sunday evening for southeastern Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin see County himself 2:45 radar indicated a storm capable of producing a tornado once again of the city's impacted no-hoper Robbinsdale crystal Columbia Heights Brooklyn Center hilltop New Brighton Fridley Brooklyn Park Arden Hills Shoreview and mouths view and the poll numbers Mike if people aren't in a safe place if they've seen anything 99 9 2006 toll-free 186 95 9 - to fix the mic now what are you seeing on radar actually I'm not picking up anything for wise that would fit with image G the tornado but again that says it means about Hill obedient to me because chances are this is a small tornado that is very difficult to pick up on on conventional Doppler radar so we do rely on the spotters when it comes to time places chances are that small tornado now it's risky boldest right around highway 100 and your old okay and if that's the case and if that is a true report it looks like really any place around say fluid park and and the the the area around Minneapolis approach II downtown could be in danger again we don't have official confirmation to this but we do have and you believe it was a very reliable eyewitness and again it wouldn't surprise me based on the volatility of the weather right now chances are it's a small tornado but we are under a tornado warning speed refused to repeat those parameters again for sure um and we have that caller on the line Mike if you want to bring in that go ahead all right we're gonna bring that in in a moment here are the parameters of the warning just issue extreme stubborn Anoka County East Central Hennepin County northwestern Ramsey County this is the heart of the Twin Cities area new Robbinsdale crystal Columbia Heights Brooklyn Center hilltop New Brighton Fridley Brooklyn Park Rd Hills Shoreview mom's view that is the northern part of the Twin Cities metro area North Minneapolis north of st. Paul oh geez alright let's bring in John John you're on the air you called us come on I go yeah Mike you are seeing the real thing I have just now got two confirmation eye Doppler radar there is a tornado in your area it appears to be moving towards the st. Anthony area moving to the Northeast what were you at now we were right on the entrance ramp from highway yes right right you don't see it okay alright thank you so much for that call based on what I'm seeing now on Doppler radar and I am seeing some circulation it looks like the city's up and I'm doing my best here based on the sketchy information we have is just to the north east of downtown Minneapolis it appears or Northwest to downtown Minneapolis area is around crystal Newhall Portland Center Brooklyn Park Saint Anthony it looks really tough down that way if the tornado holds together and continues moving it'll naturally move into the frisbee area and I'm into plane based on what I'm seeing now on Doppler radar and again yes we have an update from a moment ago that tornado warning remains in effect through northwestern Ramsey essential Hennepin and south-central Anelka County until 2:45 once again radar indicated we've had I witness reports of your Golden Valley near Minneapolis moving northeast at 35 miles an hour and just a quick recap we're talking crystal Robbinsdale Brooklyn Center Columbia Heights hilltop Brooklyn Park scribbling to Brighton Arden Hills Spring Lake Park and Mounds View if you're in those areas take covers what I'm seeing right now is I'm seeing definite tornado circulation based on the eyewitness reports this is the real thing whether or not it's still on the ground I can't say but to take cover right now any place north of i-94 it appears like it's in the st. Anthony area book when card plane it's moving towards freely and that's the best indication I have right now there is definite science on Doppler radar of a tornado on the northwest northern side now a Minneapolis may be a little bit towards the northwest Brooklyn Park st. Anthony Fridley Columbia Heights and that area and surrounding cities there's so many suburbs in that region if you're anywhere in northeastern Hennepin County southern Anoka County take cover now there may be a small tornado literally in your neighborhood and as our caller indicated it is moving fast probably 25 30 miles an hour it's closing right along alright Mike we have an eyewitness Gary in Golden Valley joining us Gary hello time we we're just a little ways east of 100 and Cedar Lake Road and it's we would have thought straight-line winds but it was incredibly windy incredible rain lots of branches down power not raining anymore and the winds are pretty much died out now it could end up being a front but there are indications why I see not radar definite circulation and I'm getting a very current radar picture it looks like it's moving right towards the Fridley area and Spring Lake Park Brooklyn Park areas like that Rapids indications are that it's a fairly small a small phenomena either tornado or gust front although it sure looks like a tornado to me and that's why we have ferny no warnings out until until 2:30 2:45 now for extreme southern Anoka County in central Hennepin County northwestern Ramsey County but the pin pointed right now I think the biggest danger is around friendly Spring Lake Park Columbia Heights blaming Mount View and some of those surrounding communities has just on the northern side of Minneapolis and hope you know on to the north-northeast down and moving quite fast - we're getting reports of hail in Brooklyn Park and that would go along typically with tornadoes even a small tornado hail is a part of the picture absolutely the two seem to go hand-in-hand it it doesn't always necessarily mean that when you have a leader of a tornado but it's no surprise to me it just indicates the lifting and strength of these thunderstorms and again when a tornado is it's an outgrowth of a general thunderstorm circulation and it's it is literally you're taking all the circulation in a thunderstorm and concentrating it to a small spot along the ground and that is a tornado it looks like to me and I he doesn't take to say this it look like a lot smaller tornadoes but nonetheless it's something that you definitely have to protect yourself against right now again it appears to like we have real real circulation"

tell Chicago Northwestern or cnw now this is part of Union Pacific's heritage lead which you know has you've been 1982 Missouri Pacific 1983 western Pacific 1988 in Missouri Kansas Texas or the caddy or a Katy whatever you want to call it or 1980-1989 Rio Grande 1995 CMW as you can see here in 1996 Southern Pacific 1995 was the year that the officially cnw merged with the Union Pacific and ever since then they had this heritage unit to pretty much resemble that CMW is part of EPE or as a memorial for CMW I don't know but they have this Hermitage unit and this is my second favorite you'd be here to do it so I decided to make a little model out of it and as you can see it's not completely finished I still do have the hammer else to put on it but that's that's all I have to do today and rose on it it's done as you see it's about 40-something bricks lon and six wide used a lot of green and yellow I'll give you a closer up view right there so back all right she the light up there the headlight and to ditch lights down there I did get I haven't gotten a logo put on here yet I dad will do that as we scroll down here scroll move got the exhaust thing right here pretty much more grills there I put them black you know because real life it's they're not green anymore they're black to look it to be painted they're gonna be black then you've got the sd70ace thing back here as you see got the logo Chicago and northwestern system and then you've got the U P I'm sorry about that camera doesn't want to focus proud heritage powerful future and yeah you've got that back there the grills all you got the k5l la that's my best it's not my best but that's my rep it's a reputation or my model with the k5 ll a but now I'll go ahead and flip it over for you guys you see you guys can see the other side of it alright so here's this side and this side is pretty much my favorite side of you know two sides pretty much because I think it looks the best now on the other side you had like the thing that goes up like right here and I had to have that line than where the yellow comes in and to figure out how to do that and my worked as hard as I can on that and I think it turned out pretty good alright I said the only thing I have to do is put handrails on it and put another logo up on the front but pretty good you've got the cab the windows all the grilles the logo k5l la you got the brake wheel right there you know and roll that around it throws the brake on and off leases it well whatever you want to want it to do how much brake you want proud heritage powerful future stuff then you have that sp70 I really don't know what that is believe it or not and almost be throw and ever and I don't know what that is I'm used he's happy he's like say you got the exhaust right there 1995 it doesn't look the best sitting a cat up there well yeah going down we'll move down a bit to the trucks now these trucks are primitively almost accurate you know if I wanted to make it prototypically accurate I have to have my hoses and iron grandma it's like everywhere but that would be if I did that in Lego it would look very bad so I just close I can get to real got my trucks all that steps there or it's pretty prototypical a luxury you know same truck over there the trunk of the others over there is the same as that so I'm just gonna move on gas tank gas tank here is pretty cool well the one thing I don't like about this is that there's a gap to stud gap in between the gas tank and the trucks so I don't really like that it's either to stud no it's a three stud please sir but there's a gap in between don't really like it so I'm putting we're gonna try and extend the gas tank one stud on each side but I don't know I might I might not just depends but now I'll go ahead and give you guys an overview on the top here you've got the GPS or a slash air conditioning unit or radar or whatever that box is used or you got like I said you got the lights right there no they did the lights do not line got the exhaust the k5 lla my best reputation the sd70ace thing like radiator I'm pretty sure I really don't know what that is you get some more exhaust things for radiators back you got some lights and some stuff there but that's pretty much it on this review guys yeah this is my first sd70ace that I've made which I think turned out pretty good I might make another one I might know no no it just depends if you guys like this or not I might probably make another one who knows but anyway that's pretty much it just want to show you guys this mm pretty much it thank you guys for watching and I will get a lot more videos out if you guys want my Lego collection Lego stuff that if that's what you guys like and I'll post it and make more videos of it but that's it on this review and I thank you so much for watching this and subscribing and liking but anyway subscribe for a lot more videos and get tons more out if you guys like HL scale trains or Lego I'll get both out as soon as I can but like I said that's it and I'll see you next time thanks for watching"

        "transcript": "hi guys this is a be fair score builder you can build this squad for around 350k um we're going to start off in goal um as you can see we've got petacheck in goal um fantastic keeper i think he's i think he's the highest rated keeper in the bpl and i think he played i think he plays the best in goal um you can get hugo laurice and um and joe hart but you know even even like inform joe heart doesn't really i think come up to the standards of check checks amazing uh moving on to center backs we've got uh vincent company uh he's an absolute beast in centre-back also going with young tongan uh they're both belgian they both get the link um and then in right back we've got kyle walker who gets the link with the tongan walker's pace is really good uh it makes him 5k but um his 92 pace is amazing uh right back and he really stays back and also goes up um so he's good left back um we can choose really between baines or coal i'm gonna put baines in um to my first team just simply because um he's got amazing free kicks and his overall stats they're all in 70s they're all his stats are really consistent and um he's he's a fantastic player for only um 2.8k you know um so this is where things get interesting um cdm we've got inform goodbye um now i've played five games he hasn't scored yet but he is fantastic to play with um he ca he stays back he can defend he's got consistent stats um and even his shot is is really good so and he looks impressive in the squad you know so he's good to have um i'll go to left mid next left mid we've got uh willian and shirley willian i'm going to put in the cl in the team but really it'll make a difference sherlock has his advantages as well uh willian are picked up for 28k and like i say i'll put the prices on the screen as i go on to each player um so you can see the overall total at the end i've got willian there 88 pay 18 dribbling um he hasn't scored for me yet but i'm sure i will do uh right mid i've got uh jesus navas he is fantastic player i had to get navas um when i built this team he i think he was one of the first players they got i just had to play with him 91 paid 86 dribbling uh he scored for me he set up two assists um four star skill moves um i'd recommend i'd recommend him he's got a high attacking work great and i've got the hawk on him chemistry style uh that boosts pace shot and heading and um he just cuts in so well with his with his skill moves forced on dribbling 86 he cuts in so well and scores some fantastic goals but in cam we've got his teammate that's right david silva um i paid 118k for david silva and he is worth it i can tell you that he's worth it he's got two goals in five games so not bad uh he's got three assists um his dribbling is amazing and his skill moves it works so well um where he is in cam um and he just he just links very well with the strikers and to set them up for goals now onto the strikers we have a few here um i've put in benteke on the left you can see i got in there for very cheap and with the finisher style already on him and i got daniel sturridge as well um daniel sturridge was fantastic four four five goals in four games i put the maestro on him to get his shot dribbling and passing um 90 pace is fantastic you can put in those if you if you do aerial through balls like i do he's fantastic he's six foot um left footed if you put him on the right he can quit inside on that and he's just the goal scorer for me um he's fantastic so that's the first 11 there um you can see it's quite impressive now what's great about this team is the subs the subs really complement this team so well um so we've got in left back ashley cole as we saw before my goalkeeper david deye um fantastic because of his reflexes 88 reflexes 86 diving but he's cheap as well so he fills out squad lot and he's six foot four as well um who else we got we've got zabaleta in right back um that keeps the man city link up to navas that's good um we've also got sako as my center back rotation um i just find him a really strong defender um he's a bit like a company really um left mid likely said i've got shirley um he's very similar to william but he's his shot's a lot better um sometimes i prefer to play him over over william um next we got joe titch up from uh he's a great great filler in uh if i wanted to change him for benteke um eight seven dribbling he's got the finish of the finisher chemistry to the island and um he's fantastic to play with we've also got nasri um as a sub for david silva's teammate he's fantastic as well i picked him up for 15k so he's an expensive sub but he's definitely worth it filling for um too well to make up for the standards of david uh silver really next up we've got nanny for right mid um he goes quite well for navas and then finally we've got fellaini and cdm fill in for inform kabay um fellaini starts very consistent and i've given him the powerhouse chemistry style so that's it you can build this team for it it was around 350k and i'll get the exact price on once i've put them all up um that's all it starts and yeah this team is fantastic if you want to go and build it uh it's in the four one two one two formation uh which i find really strong uh so thanks for listening thanks for watching give it a like and um drop a subscribe and uh i'll see you next time let me know if you want me to do more squad builders this spins till x97 you"

Melfi center free room and brought back the raw foods there and introduced wheatgrass there and brought back the garlic that was there and throughout Europe helped dr. Schauer and Foundation Soleil in Geneva Switzerland and spent about a year with him and throughout Europe as well as in Middle East and the East and taught the raw food living from the valley went back in 1980 they asked me to direct Epocrates and since then I've been the director since 1980 we moved to properties 21 years ago from cold and dreary Boston - yeah sunny and wonderful West Palm Beach you learn lots of fantastic thing is it's a jungle set and it's warm and people love it and it's much easier to make the transformation in those environments we have spa pools and it's a very serious program a medical staff that works at our side we do blood tests"

        "transcript": "[Music] so it's round two for the Samsung Galaxy Notes and it's bigger beefier and a lot more polished than before Samsung's even calling it a smartphone this time around which makes it the most powerful smartphone on the planet and then there's the Spen stylus which has been overhauled with a bunch of fancy new tricks but more on that later on the design front it looks like a super sized S3 so plastic and lightweight but sturdy with round Corners a massive bright display and Uber thin bezel essentially blending the two into one slick device it's narrower than its predecessor and thinner at 9.4 mm the home button is also a little sleeker and the phone comfier to hold annoyingly though it's a little too easy to knock that power button so you might accidentally turn off the screen one-handed use is achievable though depending on the size of your hands but most will be able to operate the basics without shifting grip and while it's not too big that it feels unwieldy it is perhaps a bit too big for a smartphone but if you do foresee looking silly holding it up to your ear just bag yourself a Bluetooth headset now what's particularly impressive is that Samsung has crammed an even larger screen into a slightly more compact handset taking that screen from 5.3 in to 5.5 and the 720p Super AMOLED display is absolutely gorgeous and amazing for movies throwing up a really clear and Vivid picture even dark scenes look really good it's now 16 by9 too and maximizes that extra screen Space by squeezing in another icon the screen is excellent in other areas too like with Google Maps it's clear Vivid and will be great as a satav and it's not just pretty on the outside the processor has been upgraded from a dual core 1.4 GHz processor to An Almighty 1.6 GHz quad core chip complemented nicely by 2 gig of RAM and from the moment you start prodding and swiping away it becomes abundantly clear that this thing is fast really fast you're getting an amazing multimedia gaming and general user experience and multitasking is slick with the help of Jelly Bean and project butter opening up and transitioning between apps is a touch quicker than the Galaxy S3 and swiping through images browsing and firing up the camera are all Snappy unfortunately though we suffered a few crashes when using the gallery app and streaming a video from the web now all of the S3s features are present on the Note 2 like popup play so you can watch a video in a small window while browsing the web or playing a game for example there's also Smart Stay to keep the display on when you're looking at it the popup browser however is new and a pretty handy feature to have around and then there's the easily accessible S Pen stylus when removed it immediately triggers popup note and the S Pen has been improved it's easier to hold has a rubber tip side mounted button and wack on digitizer smarts and handwriting generally feels a lot more natural and accurate the keyboard has been improved too allowing you to shift it to the left or right for easy one-handed typing a neat little trick is Air View hover the S Pen over Gallery folders emails or video timelines for a quick preview gimmicky yes but it could prove very very useful we particularly like cropping around images from the web to paste into scrapbook or an email it's messy but the process feels closer to ripping out magazine Pages you can also insert videos pictures and text boxes into your notes Samsung supplies a bunch of templates for things such as meeting minutes and recipes and and like draw something you can also record your sketch creation and whether using the stylus or your finger the browsing experience here is excellent the screen is large for full desktop websites and small text is easy to read now with Android 4.1 Jelly Bean Straight Out of the Box there's instant access to Google Now that will learn your behavior via your location calendar entries and searches before displaying cards with helpful info like the local weather restaurant recommendations and bus timetables combined with SVO the note proves to be a great Siri rival and of course there's the familiar and minimalist touch with UI which means you get seven home screens its own set of app icons a few handy widgets like this and a custom lock screen like the S3 the Note 2 has an 8 megapixel Snapper with LED flash which gives very similar results though due to its size and weight it's more difficult to keep steady when setting up a shot there's 1080p video 20 photo burst mode and the ability to take photos while filming autofocus speed is very good and overall camera performance is excellent in good lighting conditions while photos in low light are passable and one of the most impressive specs of the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 has got to be its battery you're looking at around 8 to n hours of course depending on use and that's based on looping a fullcreen video with Wi-Fi and 3G switched on the built-in memory can be expanded by up to 64 gig via micro SD it's LTE compatible or NFC and S Beam let you transfer content between devices so if you're looking for a device to use as a smartphone and also a mini tablet the Note 2 is the obvious choice and the best choice it offers everything the Galaxy S3 can do but on a much larger scale so if you can find room for it in your pocket or your bag the Note 2 will pay you in kind with a beautifully giant display impeccable multitasking the latest version of Android and of course all that Spen fun you might look a bit silly holding it up to make a call and for most people that Spen probably won't be used on a daily basis but what you're looking at here is one incredibly powerful machine [Applause] [Music]"

        "transcript": "hi everyone so I've had my natural hair now for 6 months and I decided that it's well and truly time for a trim so if you'd like to see how I went about trimming my natural hair then stay tuned if you want to follow along you will need some hair clips a comb you will need a spray bottle with some water in some sort of oil or oil based product and you will also need some scissors optionally you can also include a happy dance as well as a large dose of patients and a sens of FEMA I decided to start off on dry hair so obviously my hair needs some moisture so I'm spraying my hair with some water and just trying to get my hair to loosen up a little because I am going to need to part it in order to get the trimming done [Music] you can definitely part your hair any way that you like in order to get this done this is just the way that I personally prefer to part my [Music] hair so here I'm using the Divine Roots Shea moisturizing cream just to add to my hair just to give my hair that extra bit of lubrication as you can tell I really love this product because I've used it in multiple ways in different tutorials on my channel um I use it when washing my hair hair when adding um curly products to my hair I just absolutely love it so after making sure that my hair is combed through and detangled properly I just start to twist my hair into smaller sections so you can put your hair into small plats if you prefer um and if you feel like you're not that good at doing twists in your hair but to be honest it really doesn't matter as long as your hair is in smaller sections then and it just really [Music] helps now at this point I realized that even though I put my hair in twists for me personally the twists were too big I didn't feel like I would be able to trim my hair properly with those larger twists so I just decided to put them into smaller twists so that I'd be able to control the amount of hair that I was cutting off just remember that you can part your hair into as large or as small sections as you personally prefer but I think that in order to make it as accurate as possible it's better to have smaller sections than large [Music] sections it's a little bit difficult to explain how I did this but basically I slide my fingers down the twists individually until I feel like I have maybe only about a CM left in my fingers and then I cut [Music] as you can see I didn't really cut off very much it just ends up as being a little curl left in my hand and I just keep going so I did for the back what I usually do when I'm in any style and I basically separated out my hair into rows and then decided to twist them and then cut them [Music] so I decided to trim each small section straight after twisting just to make sure that there was no confusion between bits that had been trimmed already and bits that hadn't cuz of course you can't see at the back of your head and now this is that part of the video where everything goes a bit faster just so that you can see everything that I did but in less time [Music] now it definitely pays to be extra careful when you're using this method because look at my face yep I snitched just a little bit too much but it was not the end of the world it's fine it will grow [Music] back now for the middle section I I just take a little bit of extra care because I know that that hair in that section doesn't really twist up as well and tends to come apart a little bit more easily so I just take a bit more time with that section [Music] and finally you get to clearly see how much hair has been cut off which is really not that much and this is the end result so I ended up using this as a basis for a chunky twist out as you will be able to see right here so after my trim my hair was in a really good State and I was really happy with the results so of course please don't forget that trimming is your friend and not your enemy I will we see you in the next video thank you for watching bye [Music]"

        "transcript": "hey there fellow minecraftian my name is Minecraft Scorpion and I've been playing and making videos of Minecraft for quite a while now in this time I've learned a lot of tricks that can help you out in Minecraft and today I'm going to share those with you here are 11 Minecraft tips and [Music] tricks number one whenever you're entering a cave stronghold M Shaft or anywhere else where you can get lost easily make sure to always place the torches on one side of the wall in the video I put them on the right side and when you're in somewhere deep and you want to go back to the entrance just turn around and follow the torch on your left side to get to the entrance once again this will ensure easy navigation even though you have no idea where you actually are number two you can cover up the water in your Farms with half slabs or hole blocks but it's much more useful to use lily pads these lily pads will give you no extra elev ation and it will be like you're walking on the water besides that it also looks pretty cool number three a while ago cheats were added to Minecraft but if you still have an old survival world or you accidentally forgot to turn cheats on when you created a world you can't turn them on again luckily there is an easy way to bypass this press Escape click open to land Enable cheats and click Start land world and you're ready to give yourself all the diamonds you could wish for number four a lot of people don't like to chop down pine trees because they are so tall when you try to mine them there will always be one or two pieces stuck in the top that you just can't reach a simple solution to this is to always bring ladders when you go pine tree chopping two ladders are enough just place them on the side go up make a place for you to stand and mine up when you're done you can just go back again destroying the logs will also pop off the letters and you can move on to the next tree number five before I begin I would like to say that this is a bug and there is a possibility that this will be fixed in the future so when you're stuck in a cave and you want to go up very quickly again just do this make a small opening 2x one and behind that one of 3x one like so close the hole off and drop a gravel block on top of your head then close off that hole as well and then as you can see I'm stuck in there like this just exit out of your world reload your world and look at that you're on the surface again number six when you need colored wool always make sure to paint the sheep first and then sheare him instead of shearing him and then painting the wool a sheep drops one to three pieces of wool so one die will give you one to three pieces pieces of colored wool well when you paint wool afterwards it will always cost you one Dy per wool number seven when you're going mining and you do not have a lot of food or you just want to get rid of your zombie flesh be sure to always bring a milk bucket with you now you can pick up every single bit of rotten flesh these zombies drop eat it to refill your hunger bar and then drink the milk to get rid of The Hunger effect that it creates like this you can consume the rotten flesh as if it was a normal stake number eight you can use different types of formatting in books get your book and Quil out and start writing to start formatting you will need to put in these section sign if you don't have it on your keyboard you can just paste it in and when you've done that and you now put a letter behind it it will give you a formatting effect for example section sign L is bolded text section sign m is strike through text n is underline text o is italic uh the numbers one to n and such give you give out colors along with some other keys and finally to reset all text effects back to normal you can use section sign R another cool text effect is section sign K which will generate a bunch of flashing random characters so sign your book and watch in all on how awesome it looks number nine you can easily divide a stack of something in three by halfing it with right click five times and then putting it back on the other stack the six time you half it you can put it next to the other one and you will have a nicely divided stack this sounds complicated but it actually is really really easy try it out for yourself number 10 you can make a sapling always grow into a big tree by making a three high dirt pillar and putting torches on the side of that then put the sapling next to it and keep putting bone meal on it until it grows now that this on average does take a lot more bone meal than normal number 11 never fall in lava because your finger slipped off the shift key Again by toggling sneaking you can do so by pressing shift and then pressing F10 then just click once more on your Minecraft and shift should be toggled this is especially useful for things like making bridges in the nether if you all of the sudden do not want to sneak anymore because say a Wither Skellington is attacking you just hit shift once more and you will stop sneaking this also works with any other key so if you for example want to toggle walking forward just press W hit F10 and walking should be toggled and those were my 11 Minecraft tips and tricks my name is Minecraft scorpion thanks for watching and I hope to see you next time [Music]"

        "transcript": "You made a loaf of homemade bread, but the crust ended up being hard as a rock. I think I broke a tooth. Has this ever happened to you? Do you wish that your loaf had nice, soft crust like the bread you buy at the store? The bad news is that the loaf you already baked is toast. Toast is hard an crunchy...nevermind. But the good news is there is hope for\nyour next loaf. But before we get to that, let's ask why the\nloaf gets hard in the first place. Lot's of the loaf's moisture escapes as steam while it's cooling. Maybe you're thinking, \"If you could prevent the steam from escaping,\" \"..the crust won't dry out.\"  And you'd be right. But there's a right way and a wrong way to do it.  Some wrong ways would be to put it in a box, or some sort of bag. For the box, it's because there's still air space for the steam to escape out of the loaf, and you still loose moisture.  For bags, it's\nbecause bags tend to expand when you get steam inside them causing the same\nproblem. You need something that wraps the loaf up tightly. Now you may be thinking, \"What about aluminum foil?\"\nYou'd be on the right track, except that steam can corrode aluminum, which can cause holes to form, and steam to escape, and may leave   some metal residue on your loaf. And yes, I am speaking from experience.\n That leaves us with: Plastic wrap. Now maybe you're savvy, and maybe you've heard that if you expose plastic wrap to high temperatures, (such as you would have with steam), then toxic chemicals can be leeched out of the plastic, and contaminate your food.  That used to be true, but not so much anymore; most plastic wraps these days are safe.  And if you want to be sure, check the box.  If it says it's microwave safe, or provides microwave instructions, or if the box says\n\"low-density polyethylene\", then it's safe. As far as we know. As soon as it's done baking,  quickly remove it from the pan. Cut off a large piece of plastic wrap\nand tightly wrap up the loaf. Make sure that there are no holes. Don't take the plastic off Until it's completely cool. If there are any damp spots on the crust after you've unwrapped it, let it dry in the air for a couple of minutes, before putting it in a bag for\nlong-term storage. Congratulations; you've made a loaf with a nice, soft crust!"

available and started shipping yesterday uh if you pre-ordered the rain 68 you should hopefully be getting it sometime this week or next week and this video we're just going to take a quick rundown and walk through the new rain 68 mixer now obviously as you should have know and heard by now one of the big new features on the rain 68 mixer is this dual USB on the back of the mixer right here now what this allows is two Scratch Live DJs to connect to the mixer in play simultaneously or to just uh facilitate an easier switching out between DJs as most of you probably know switching DJs between uh sets is a pretty common experience people often encounter when they go out and play to the club everyone brings their own SL1 or sl3 and then they have to fum roll around switching the wires around and whatnot while they set up their own uh Scratch Live Box well uh this ain't going to happen anymore with the rain 68 mixer both DJs can just plug in and out uh at will with this new dual USB function or they can tag team together or if you're just playing by yourself you'll get uh four Channel mixing uh if you so wish in the scratch life software uh so let's take a rundown and look through some of the features on the mixer obviously it is a four channel mixer uh the eqs uh three band EQ full kill isolator typ type uh so let me just turn it up so uh we get full kills on all the EQ knobs okay and then we also let each channel has a dual filter uh similar to the djm800 so uh turning it to the left we'll do a low pass filter and turning it to the right we'll do a high pass filter so that is the Dual filter uh over here are the effects and LCD screen these are the available effects that you have you have a filter Auto filter flanger phaser Echo robot and Reverb uh let's just take a quick look at some of the effects uh the flex effects button is how you uh select which channel you want to send to the effects processor let me turn that down a little bit uh so let's do a uh filter effect right here Auto filter as you can see the screen uh you got the BPM which corresponds to the BPM in Scratch Live uh you have the beat amount up here and the time parameter uh the beat buttons right here will switch between the different lengths you want to do for the uh effect so let's do a a one beat manual or excuse me auto filter turn the wet dry up you can change the amount in the effect all right so let's take a look at a flanger effect let's do a Let's do an 8 beat one you can change the beat Mount [Music] again so that was the filter effect let's take a look at a phaser so the phaser uh it's the echo uh the echo is post fader so when you gauge the effect and drop the fader the tail of the echo will still play out like so so is the echo effect let's take a look at the robot which is basically a pitch shift effect uh not one of my favorite ones but it's still there so that will uh you can adjust the amount of the pitch beat buttons will jump by 20% increments and one of my personal favorites is the Reverb hold on let me jump back in the track a little bit Reverb is also post fader so if you drop the fader the tail end of the Reverb will play out so that are some of the hardware effects on the Range 68 you also have the option to root the new uh effects in the DJ effects in scratch life uh to the mixer as well and those will be post Vader as well all right so let's move along to the side now which are the control strips uh you have basically five midi pages that you can assign to these but over here uh the default page one is just going to be what is labeled on the mixer itself so these are going to control the uh Auto Loop link scrolling up here uh manual looping in and out uh loop rolls etc etc uh down here the five buttons will switch uh or excuse me toggle and set Q points and Trigger them uh if you want to shift to a different midi page you have to hit the shift button up here at the top and then press the corresponding 2 3 four or five buttons down here which I can't hit right now obviously cuz my hand isn't long enough and I'm holding the camera in my other hand but that's how you shift between the different mini pages and then you have the uh same uh selection over here on the other side uh you can scroll through your track listing up here with this knob up here uh like that so that will uh scroll through the uh your crates and your track listing uh moving along now let's take a look at the faders um four channels uh you have range patented magnetic cross fader uh right here unfortunately the channel faders are not the magnetic faders uh that would increase the cost of the mixer even more than it already is uh but the channel feds still feel pretty smooth uh but you get the nice uh patented rain magnetic cross Vader uh down on the front of the mixer are going to be your uh curve controls for the uh line faders right here so you have a slow or sharp and same thing with the cross fader uh slow cross fade or sharp for all you scratchers and turntable list uh this Flex effects mix level knob uh this is kind of a weird one uh it's kind of like wet dry knob but it doesn't really control the wet dry amount of the effects it kind of sounds like the sun level uh because since you have uh dual USBS you have a lot of channels of audio that you can send to other programs as well and use for effects so you can do a lot of uh rooting options with the effects as well which I haven't even got into yet but we're going to be taking a look at that in some of my upcoming videos over here we have the headphone section uh you have your uh headphone level uh your Q Master knob right here so all the way left will uh just listen to your Q in the headphone all the way right will be just the master in the headphone and in the middle will be a blend of the Q and The Master signal you also have the split Q option now uh this is good if you have crappy monitors at the club or no monitors at all uh this uh will split the Q signal into the left side of your headphone and the master signal will be in the right side of your headphone uh moving up we have session in and out for auxiliary input and output uh controls uh your booth output and your master pan balance Left Right pan uh you have dedicated mono switch uh since a lot of clubs run in mono you have a switch to uh put it into monel and it won't be in Stereo and then your master output level up here at the top uh overall though that's uh that's pretty much it so this is a first sneak peek look at the new rain 68 mixer again uh it's available now started shipping yesterday so uh if you pre-ordered it you should be uh hopefully getting it sometime this week or next week and uh here we go so this is the first look at the new rain 68 mixer available now"

it's given me the most fantastic view across the lake and I'm sure you'll agree that the climb was worth the view [Music] the cable car takes you from the lake right the way up to the top of the mountain where you get the most spectacular View and you can see it behind me from the southernmost tip of Lake Garda to the northernmost tip it's 75 km in length at its deepest point it's 3 km come right up to the top of Monte Balo to get the most wonderful views of Lake Gard this is Italy's musty Lake and a major tourist destination located in the north of the country the lake bow superb surroundings join me on my tour as I enjoy a real Taste of Italy I'll sample the well-known Regional Delicacies I'll take a late cruise to view the surrounding Villages from the water visit picturesque towns and Charming Villages it's all to come as we go full circle around Lake Garder [Music] I was here with Ledger holidays director Hugh Williams who's a big fan of this part of Italy hello my name's Hugh Williams I'm here in Lake Garder on my Lake Garder Venice and Verona director's Choice holiday it's one of the most popular places for our guests to come every year and that's because it's very peaceful and it's very relaxing just breathe the Mountain Air it's superb the mountains the lake the pretty Lakeside villages the local food the wine it makes it an absolutely unbeatable destination after a refreshing cappuccino back down the mountain we go to the lake side now at the foot of Monte Balo you've got Mal chzn absolutely Charming here you've got small streets that Meander around each other and wherever you go you seem to be able to smell Italian cooking at the moment I'm getting wafts of cake and bread malne hugs the lake the Maze of local streets are a perfect place to wander around offering a little bit of shade and plenty of shopping opportunity the narrow cobbled streets cluster beneath a 13th century turreted Castle the town's most prominent Landmark being a keen historian I wanted to learn more about the castle so I asked Antonio a local guide to take me around the 13th century fortifications and its even older medieval Tower Antonio tell me about males the Castel of Maes is is very famous Castel because it's building uh around 15 uh 100 and uh the building is um is very good preserved because and the location of the the castle is uh is very is very good to see the very nice view of the Lake Garda before leaving m chesne a quick tip for you you cannot come to Italy without trying gelato which I have to say is incredibly tasty and ever so refreshing let me take you down to the other end of the lake and one of the larger settlements on Lake Garda Simone is in the southern part of Lake Garda and it's got a very special Castle which you can see behind me now the reason this is quite intriguing is the way in which the fort has been designed with water right the way around it inside there's an area which offered a safe haven for ships when the lake was rather rough but also the way it's designed traps anybody who's trying to invade the castle the ancient fortified town of serone is the gem of the peninsula at the south of the lake there are lovely cobbled streets to explore and shops to wander around a rare Castle a Roman villa and old hot springs makes this a historically very valuable place now that castle looks fantastic from the land but there's one really special way of viewing it and that's jumping on a [Music] boat I was saying before that one of the unique things about this Castle is the fact that anybody trying to invade would potentially get stuck inside with their boat and I'm going to experience it firsthand because they actually do allow you to go in in the boats and have a look at the castle from inside which is quite [Music] [Music] special it's quite early in the morning and there's a really refreshing Breeze we've come back out to the lake to have a look at all the outlining towns and Villages of Lake Gard behind me you can see Riv Del Gard in the background which looks absolutely beautiful um just in front of me is Monte Balo which I climbed yesterday to get those wonderful views across the lake and it's beautiful to come out this time in the morning and just see the whole of Lake Garda before the rest of the world wakes up Riv del Garda is located at the Northwestern corner of Lake Garder the town is located at the southern Edge of the Italian Alps near the dolomites Riva often hosts cultural activities especially during the summer months in the main Square in R delgard you can find the Bell Tower built in 1220 it was built to defend the town and had salt and grain stores store rooms and exchange banks at its foot the Forerunner to a shopping Precinct but it also had another use a prison and then there was the observation post during World War I Reaver toown is another Maze of Cobble streets ice cream shops restaurants and [Music] [Applause] cafes there's nothing more relaxing than sitting by the Waterside I'm right down by the lake in lemono which is a really delightful picturesque postcard if you like Village on Lake Gada and one of the nicest things about lemon is if you fancy a stroll and then maybe a coffee or a cake this is the place to do it because it's got a traditional [Music] prominade lemon has Old Fisherman's houses mixed in with lemong Groves you can sit at the water's edge in cafes or bars or head into the back streets where the shops are filled with leather handicrafts Lake Gard is a great location for a relaxing but insightful Ledger holidays getaway be it history culture Cuisine wine or sun or just beautiful views Lake Garder has something for everyone I heartily recommend a break on the lake

        "transcript": "hi I'm post-break the family and I own Edgewater farm in Plainfield New Hampshire it's my daughter Sarah over there son Raymond and my wife in Edgewater farm is about 270 acres seventy of it tillable and we're in a diverse mix of small fruit vegetables and greenhouse crops pretty much everything that we grow on the farm is marketed to our two farm stands our basic philosophy is that because we have such sandy soils here and we're using them so intensively that we just feel that cover crops or an important component in soil amendment and yeah just basically maintaining a healthier soil the font on the soil rather than going in and clean cultivating massive areas there's a lot of wasted space so we cover crop whenever we possibly can we use a summer smother when we have finished up a short-term crop like peas in particular if we're not going back with something immediately we will use a summer smother to suppress weeds and add some organic matter buckwheat is probably the simplest summer smother for us to manage it's very quick we seed it anywhere I think the recommended rate is a bushel per acre but I'm sure that weed glom on pretty close to two or even more sometimes it's very quick it's very easy to work down we have a set of fairly heavy Haros and we can go in right now in short order and incorporate this with a set of Haros as well as put on a winter cover crop at the same time so it's very easy to manage in terms of the machinery that we own we have here as a crop of Japanese millet on a piece of fairly heavy ground that we're not using this year so we're using a longer season cover crop here to build organic matter in the soil the ground was well prepared when we got on to this we broadcast about three bushels the acre which is very very heavy as you can see but we figure if you're going to grow a crop and the fertility is there you might as well put it on heavy with our especially with cover crops I like the Japanese millet over the Sudan is it's a little easier to incorporate if the Sudan and soot acts get ahead of you which they sometimes can when you're picking vegetables late in the summer it can get quite woody and it's very hard to incorporate in the fall it's now about the 15th of August hopefully another week we'll get someone down here with a heavy set of Haros and we'll Harrow this up probably once over we'll chop it up and expose a little of the dirt will come in and broadcast either peas and oats on top of that or hairy vetch and winter rye and disc it in lightly and that'll give us a winter cover crop this is a system we've been using for about ten years on our very sandy soils certain crops like the tomatoes melons summer squash vine crops we've interceded between the rows of the crop we put in strips of clover this does two things for us one we feel we're getting some benefits to the soil by cover cropping and not clean cultivating and second of all it just makes a nice work environment as you can see for the workers to pick it gives us some cultural benefits in terms of the plants instead of crowding them they've got you know ten feet that makes it easier to spray it makes so that they get better air drainage we use white clover in this system as opposed to grasses on sandy soil we found that white clover establishes itself it tillers out makes them nice real nice mat by the fall we manage it by seeding it early in April we see that with a brilliant cedar after the beds been prepared for both the laying of plastic will come through after plastics down the drip tapes down and we'll see the clover and long before we come in and transplant the the crop it needs the early spring moisture to get established and then we'll mow it several times usually when it gets about six to eight inches high with the weeds well when it gets to be a nuisance or the help will let me know if it needs to be mowed it will usually come up to broad leaves in all manner of weeds and we mow the weeds off several times that usually suppresses all the broad leaves and sometimes we'll have an issue in June with crabgrass and we may come in with post or some post emergent grass or beside this particular cover crop has not been sprayed with anything we've just managed it by mowing white clover is probably the most expensive cover we could put down but because of its height because it establishes well for us and because it is a legume we think that it's probably well worth it"

        "transcript": "the AP films ipso Studios were based in a warehouse on the slow trading estate previously they'd worked in a converted Ballroom in a mansion at iset Park but AP films relocated to these larger premises in 1959 between the production of the pilot film of four Feather Falls and the second episode of the series and over a period of roughly six weeks this Warehouse was converted to the needs of the company these are the front doors of the studio but they were mainly used for access to the production offices to the right are two cutting rooms now apf's films were essentially constructed in these rooms and they required much more attention in editing than other TV shows of the time in fact to keep up with the amount of editing required there were additional facilities above the cutoms including a space accessed only by a ladder where the dialogue playbacks were edited these are the main production offices this is unis Scott's office now Unis Scott began Jerry's secretary during the production of Supercar and she remained with the company for many years from here a door opens into Jerry and syvia Anderson's office these offices were made out of hardboard petitions that were extremely cramped although the premises were larger than at highet park space still remained an issue next to Jerry and Sylvia's office was another room which eventually became David Elliott's workplace when he was made production supervisor on Series 2 of supercar a door from this office led into the viewing theater this would be where the material filmed the previous day what's known as the rushes would be viewed to check that there were no problems outside the theater was a corridor that connected the south end of the building with the north end to the left was the projection room this room contained a 35mm projector which could either Point into the viewing theater and show the rushes or it could rotate 90\u00b0 and project images onto the back projection screen on the puppet stage the back projection setup involved the use of a tunnel because the studio was not large it was not possible to get the projector far enough away from the BB screen in order to create a large enough image so a tunnel was constructed with a 90\u00b0 Corner in it and in this corner there was a mirror and when the beam from the projector hit the mirror it was diverted onto the BP screen the room where the back projection tunnel was housed had originally been home to sound effects limited the sound effects company owned by Jerry Anderson and David Elliot later this office was converted into a special effect stage for Derek medings when he joined the team the back projection screen on the puppet stage was equipped with a small mobile bridge made of dexan and from here all the shots involving back projection could be filmed as well as any small scale second unit filming underwater shots could also be filmed here and on the main stage too with the aid of a specially constructed fish fish tank now this fish tank was very narrow meaning that if it was placed between the camera and the action the final result looked like it had been filmed underwater in actual fact our models and puppets hardly ever came into contact with water further down the studio we come to the main bridge this was permanently fixed to the ceiling of the studio and like the small Bridge was also constructed of dexion it was about 25 ft long and the puppeteers could operate the puppets from here 6 ft above the studio floor and there were attachments to the bridge rather like scaffolds from which the puppeteers could suspend the Marinet between takes beneath the bridge the sets rested on raised platforms rostrums made of dexium and these were mobile so they could be wheeled in and out as required at the far end of the studio was a specially built Booth it was raised off the floor to allow a clear view across the studio this room was the art Department it was where re Hill created all his design designs along with his assistant Bob Bell the room next door to the art Department was the director's Booth when these Studios were being designed Jerry had a vision of being able to direct the action on the floor from a booth just the same way television is directed so our booth was fitted with a monitor that allowed the director to see what the main Studio camera was filming also a microphone allowed us to issue instructions to the film crew But ultimately it was felt this method of directing didn't work for the programs and we later abandon it when we moved studio in the booth next to the director sat the lip sync operator with his lip sync unit this was a quarter inch tape deck playing back pre-recorded dialogue which was then converted into electrical impulses and was then sent out to one of four puppets via control on the desk this would then activate the solenoid inside the puppet's head allowing it to talk 7,000 9,000 11,000 13,000 14,000 15 heading back along the studio to the left are the loading rooms and the dark rooms this area of wall here is where the puppets were stored they were kept opposite the bridge to make it easy to pass the puppets Up To The Operators this was done with the a of a long stick named the Murray pler back in the early days of twizzle Puppeteer Joy Lori used to use this long stick to poke fellow Puppeteer muray Clark it was a name that stuck and it remained in use throughout the super marination period this is the workshop area the models and the puppets were being constructed here constantly outside the studio at the back there was a brick water tank this was constructed by John Reed during the production of Supercar and it allowed us to photograph surface shots of water such as when we needed Supercar to dive into the sea and out again we remained here at IPS road until the end of Fireball xl5 at which point L grade of ATV bought the company AP films relocated to larger premises nearby and the building was bought by special effects technician lesz Boi whom incidentally D medings had earlier been apprenticed to today the ipsr road building is greatly changed it's now a commercial tire Fitters facility and all the traces of its magical past have gone for"

        "transcript": "SubEdit b.4072 (http://subedit.com.pl) Hello, welcome to Armageddonoid video tutorial. Armageddonoid is Android (aka google phone) port of the old arcade game from the 80s. If you watched Terminator 2 movie maybe you remember what game John was playing in the video arcade when T1000 found him for the first time. So, basically this game has arcade perfect look and feel in the current release, which means really basic graphics and almost no sound. Also it was developed for the trackball only to be as close to the original as possible. You control your missile launcher using trackball. To launch missile you just press on the trackball. This is how it works... The aim of the game is to defend your six cities from death rays coming from the above. You have limited number of missiles so you need to be quick. You can also play in the full screen mode in horizontal position like this... You need to open your G1 keyboard. It will take a while and the game will reset but then you can play in the horizontal mode. If you feel that crosshair is too small you can go to options. So you just go back to main screen, you click options and you can change the crosshair to either small, medium or large. You do it like this... You save your preferences and then you can go back to the game. Now the crosshair is larger so you can see it better. One thing that users reported is that trackball can be sluggish from time to time, so again you go back to Options and you have something called trackball sensitivity. If you slide it to the maximum, then you go to Save, back to game, trackball will be much more responsive. It will be easier for you to go through the screen to aim. All right, many users have also asked for the touch screen support so it was added to the game. However, it still requires you to touch the screen, hold down and drag your finger to manipulate the crosshair. You can do it like this... So basically you move the crosshair on the screen and then you tap to fire. Still, you need to be really quick to blow the ray of death before it reaches your city. Right? The touch screen controls were implemented in a way that it does not really matter where you tap the screen or you put your finger. You still are able to aim and fire. So it does not mean you need to cover the crosshair and move it. You basically touch anywhere on the screen. So: tap, hold down, move, and tap again to fire. That would be it in this I guess short video tutorial. Have fun with the game. Thanks."

        "transcript": "greetings everyone and welcome back to more of my hopes for season 5 and Beyond in my last two videos on this topic I touched on a character that has only been briefly mentioned in the series but never shown basically I was trying to touch on some hidden untapped potential that I've noticed in the series for this video I would like to talk about a missed opportunity that I really hope the MLP staff will go back over at some point during the season 4 finale we were given an interesting and even menacing new villain some excellent character growth for an old villain a completely new setup for the main six in future Seasons as well as a number of new questions on what direction the show will take from here however I feel there is something that this finale missed out on something that I'd honestly like to see the MLP staff attempt at some point dealing with loss I can remember hearing that a bird in the hoof back in season 1 was originally supposed to be about Fluttershy coping with the death of one of her pets I don't know exactly why the writers decided to do something different but I'm quite curious to see how MLP could introduce such a topic now talking about death in a children's show must be handled with great care and I don't know whether the MLP staff will ever try introducing that story element however there is a way to talk about loss without going so far as to include the death of a character or pet when I first saw T-Rex destroy Twilight home I was stunned that Library had been part of the show since the very first episode and so many of Twilight's stories have taken place there the tree's destruction led into a very satisfying fight scene between Twilight and T-Rex but the fact that no one made any mention of Twilight's loss throughout the rest of the episode feels like the MLP staff missed out on a fantastic teaching opportunity now I wouldn't say that they should have changed the finale to include such themes more more than likely the episode would have been overcrowded with plot elements if they focused part of the story on Twilight's loss as well but now that they're moving onto season 5 I would honestly love to see one whole episode dedicated to Twilight moving on after this tragedy she would have been caught up in all the joy of restoring Equestria right after T-Rex downfall but sooner or later reality is going to catch up with her and she's going to begin feeling the effects of all that she's lost or at least I sincerely hope the writer dedicated an episode to that idea I can imagine that Twilight would start collecting the scattered remains of her books that had fallen all over Ponyville and even though many of them would contain rather trivial stories and information with other copies easily found elsewhere in Equestria for Twilight they would have fond memories attached to each of them and she would feel all the more heartbroken with every tattered and burned book she recovers until she comes comes across one of her more ancient Toms like the book she received from Princess Celestia that contains star swirls unfinished spell her despair would quickly turn into Panic as she realizes that there are no other copies of this book through painstaking work she begins to frantically try remembering all the words that were contained in her burned books night after night doing her utmost to preserve her memories as best she can of course her friends would try to help her to the best of their ability ities realizing just how important these books were to her but after a while Twilight's obsessiveness starts to reach Lesson Zero levels as she refuses to let go of anything she can possibly save from her old life the rest of the main six each try to reason with her in their own ways but still feeling sorry for her loss and unwilling to force Twilight on getting back to her normal life and it is in this moment that Spike steps in much like with Lesson Zero he has ways of reaching out to Twilight in the middle of her obsessiveness but he is also able to provide a very unique perspective on this situation because he too had lost a great deal when T-Rex destroyed their home he was there with Twilight each and every day and though Spike doesn't have the same feelings about books like Twilight does he too has had to deal with feelings of Despair over his precious things and thus both both Twilight and Spike could be learning a lesson about moving on despite tragic circumstances realizing that what they still have is far more important and that right now the best thing they can do is build towards a new future while working together that is the kind of lesson I'd like to see from MLP even if the writers don't want to introduce the concept of death into the show there is a marvelous teaching opportunity with what they've already set up if any of the staff ever comes across this video I sincerely hope they will take this idea to heart and if by chance they're already working on creating such an episode then I eagerly await seeing it in fact I hope there could also be a bit of a happy ending in the final scene of that story where Twilight comes across a gem in the ground and Spike is Overjoyed to see it Twilight is a little puzzled as to why something like this would hold such high importance to spike and I can imagine that Spike would be appreciative but not really willing to tell anyone why it is so valuable to him after all precious things often come attached with Precious Memories what do you think I am Dr Wolf and I look forward to hearing from you"

        "transcript": "hi everyone Hawaii five-o here today is a big day for me I finally moved into my new office and that means I can finally get my quarantine tank set up this tank has been sitting in my old office haunting me for the last four months because I haven't been able to get it set up or add new fish so I'm really excited to be at this stage again where I can start bringing in new fish into the display tank very excited so what this means is is that I wanted to share with you guys my process for setting up a quarantine tank adding fish to it the process that my quarantined fish go through and then getting them into the display tank I'm also going to share with you my experience with an order fish coming from an online vendor that will be blue zoo aquatics I know I've mentioned it in the past I probably wouldn't order fish from them again however there there was a particularly excellent deal on some fish that I really couldn't pass up and I would like to put my new disciplined approach to quarantine to the test on these fish so I thought that would be a good chance for me to do that so starting off with the components of a quarantine tank I've got a filter that is very much overkill in the aqua clear 110 it's a hang on the back filter I chose this filter for three reasons one is it is very flexible so what I mean by that is that it offers chemical biological and mechanical filtration it is very quiet and it is very highly reviewed against other hang on the back filters so those are the three things that were pretty important to me when looking around at filtration options for a quarantine tank the tank itself is 30 gallons and as I said this filter is definitely overkill in that it's classed for tanks up to a hundred gallons so we're gonna get a really nice high turnover of water going on in here other components that I've got for the quarantine tank too I'm 75 watt heaters just here a Corral eeeh wavemaker pump this is the Evo 1050 I believe and then I have a Marineland lid with a built-in LED light fixture here which we can see very straightforward you don't need anything to flash when you're setting up the quarantine tank in fact some people weren't even used lights I really wanted the lid more than anything else it's just a nice added bonus that the lights come with it I also have my PVC piping here and a little bit of dead Rock just to give it a bit more of a natural feel and that's basically it that's all the components that I have for the quarantine tank so I'm going to get these guys set up and I'm gonna go through the process of how I set up my quarantine tank with you guys in the next video okay so here we are at the main display tank the one I'm doing here is I'm filling up buckets with water from the display tank to put into the quarantine tank the reason why I'm doing that is because I want the fish to be in good water its nutrient rich and when I move them over into the main display tank it will make that process a lot less stressful for them it's already going to be stressful enough for them being taken from one environment and thrown into another environment let alone having to deal with the hierarchy of the fish as well as having to deal with you know the water chemistry so this way I take away a large portion of that stress on the fish so that they don't have to deal with that physical change to the water chemistry so that's what I'll be doing for here let's go ahead upstairs and we'll go to the quarantine time now all right so now we're back at the quarantine tank as you can see it's now completely filled and I've also added an air stone as well to the tank just to keep the water oxygenated some people might consider using an air stone when they have maybe weak filtration within their quarantine tank as well along with a sponge but in this case I'm just using it purely for oxygenation purposes now everything is done the only thing left to do is for me to set up the aqua clear filter and we're gonna have a look at it here as you can see it's a pretty good sized filter and what it's going to contain here is a media basket and the media that I'm going to be using in this is actually downstairs in my son so we're going to go downstairs and we're gonna have a look at that media and wires down in my son okay so here we are down in the sump I have for the last two months then storing two sets of foam inserts and two sets of the bio max ceramic media this has been in here to basically build up a colony of nitrifying bacteria that I can then take out of here and put directly into the quarantine tank and that's going to greatly reduce the cycling time if any on that quarantine tank so I'm going to pull these out of here we're going to put them in the tank upstairs and then we're going to be good to go okay so we've got the sponge and the bio max media up here the sponge just sits in this media basket and then it very simply just slots into the filter like so it's nice and snug and then we're gonna take the fire max then a bit of a shake and just drop them in the top there and then last but not the least the lid goes on there we go so that is in a nutshell the tank setup so I'm gonna go ahead and power it on this is my first time turning on the aqua clear so I'll be curious to see how quiet or loud it is it's actually pretty reasonable all right so I've got the heaters turned on that's set to 79 degrees I've also added an airstone as you can see here that's going to oxygenate the water we've got the wave maker and then we've got PVC piping and some dead Rock not too much dead Rock just enough to make the fish feel at home so that is about it guys I'm going to start doing some testing on the water we're going to test the basics which are ammonia nitrite and nitrate and then we'll be back to add some fish so see you again soon"

        "transcript": "hey this is Ralph and in this video I want to show you how easy it is to kind of plan a layout for your web [Music] page and there's all kinds of tools you could do this and a lot of web design professionals would likely use something like Photoshop to plan the layout of their website but I don't think you have to be that fancy to start off with and might as well use a tool that you most likely already have on your computer of course you could sketch us out with pen pen and paper but um I'm going to use Microsoft Word here because a lot of us already have Microsoft Word on our machines and it's pretty easy to do so um I've got a brand new document here I'm not even going to really save it but I'm going to go and change my page layout orientation to landscape and I'm going to zoom out just a bit so kind of everything fits on here I know it makes kind of small on the screen but um have that sized so that I can see the whole document I'm going to do this I'm going to go ahead and set my margins to narrow and I will put a border on there I'll do just do a page border just a box that'll be fine make it a little bit thicker just so it's easier to see for the whole document and I'll just kind of pretend that this is the boundary of my desktop monitor so to speak and then I'm going to go super simple here and I'm going to be using a lot of shapes tools so I'll go to insert shapes and I can do rectangles or I could actually do text boxes also text boxes tend to work out pretty well but I'll do a shape and I'll just do a rectangle and I'll just go ahead and draw in a shape up here that might represent the header portion of my web page something like that and you could change the the colors for the fill if you'd like I'll keep it you could change or get rid of the Border if I don't want a border just say no outline or you could have a different color I'll go and choose no outline for now and that's my basic shape now you could just do insert shape insert shape or if you put your cursor right on the border you get that fourway move handle and if I hold down my control key while I click and drag I can make copies of this and I just kind of line it up by I and word will help you out so now I've got two of them and then I can bring this down and now I've got a um a sidebar and I can click on this border with my mouse click and hold my control key drag to the right now I've got this other box click on here size that out there we go if I want to do a footer I can bring this up a little bit bring that one up a little bit I think they're about lined up take this one hold down my control key bring it right about there let go of the mouse let go of the control key size that up a bit a little bit down there you go and by the way when one of these is active you can also use the arrow keys on your keyboard let me just show you this so if I click on this I can press my down arrow key up Arrow key left and right in order to size that a little bit more precisely as well but that's the basics for just maybe creating a web page layout and it just took me a couple of minutes using some shapes and features in Microsoft Word now you could go a step further and you could start to put in where mock text might be so let me do this I'm going to hold down my shift key and I'm going to select all four of these see I just click on the click on the first one hold down my shift key and I can select all of them and then I can change the shape fill to something a little lighter or change different colors there we go I'll go back to this kind of light peach orange color there and you could do some basic things if you rightclick on a particular shape you could uh add some text and you could Mark in this is going to be the uh obviously the top Banner you can't read that text so I will select it change my text color something a little bit more noticeable change the font size there we go so there is my top banner and I could put in sidebar and stuff like that if you wanted to give the illusion well gee what might my vertical navigation menu buttons look like let me just make that a little bit wider um I could insert some more shapes I'll do another little rectangle make myself a button or what looks like a button so okay I'm happy with that just using my control key just keep making some more I'm holding down my control key letting go of my mouse letting go of my control key and then I'm doing it again and you can spend a little time lining those up and let me show you one more trick that you might use with this um right now this is basically a shape and it's not as easy to add text I know you're saying well just right click and and add text but um let's try this anyway let's see what happens if I want to give a bunch of mock text ipom text I'm going to type in a word function equals and you can't read this so let me go ahead and make my font different looking so you can see that nice and clear I will change it over to a black text and go ahead and make it a little bit bigger there we go so you see that insertion point equals lauram parentheses I'm going to do 2 comma 5 closing parenthesis so what this means is I'm going to get some lurm ipsum text two paragraphs five sentences is each and as soon as I press enter there we go I've got that mock text and I probably could have gone a little bit more but I will select this I'll do left alignment and um and there we go so now you can kind of show this mock text and by the way uh print designers web designers whenever they want to do mock text this is a good way to go because then you can show a client or just yourself you can show a client how text is going text is going to appear in that web page without them being being distracted by what the text actually reads so that's why we use this kind of text and that's just a little feature built right into word so now you have a reasonable looking web page layout and you can print copies out of this show them to clients and just you could make little sketching notes to yourself about color schemes and there you go you got your plan now you got to head over to your web editor of choice and make this page come to life"

        "transcript": "now for something a little different everybody's gonna be wondering what the hell this is um there's lots of cool little things like this you can do around your house everybody's wondering what the is in my window okay this here is garlic okay if you got it sitting around it gets a little green dot like this like on the top instead of just letting your garlic sit around and go rotten and having to buy more just set it in some half decent soil look what happens that's like a day this one was only a few days not even a week look at them now i always cut these down i use them for cooking same as onions green onions whatever but you still get the garlic flavor and they will pop back out like grass well to a point they do only for maybe a couple weeks then they sort of croak off but you know it's not bad you know how to get wrong it's like what 60 cents for a tuba clumps of garlic this i got for my brother he gave me this tray he got one of those herb kits i don't know what the hell it is rosemary maybe he killed them all so we all thought but here it is it's alive it just popped out of the dirt so we got some bonus stuff we got some spices um in case you're wondering what these dead vines are well they're mostly dead that's my doing i left the stupid window open a crack to let fresh air in your hair it got super cold at night now the vines are having a connection fit and starting to die but typical you know you get one potato center got a couple eyes plant them take a look at these less than a couple weeks look what you got new potatoes check that out these are awesome to cook with or if they're still really green plant them or grow but then again you know it's one of those ideas you do you got something going funky planet instead of just let them go rot why not if i was to dig all this up like this is just two this is just two little ones underneath here if i dug all this all the way back there'd be like a handful of the mini potatoes you know like you get in a can really good now this i have seen so many sites trying to explain how the hell to grow these technically according to all of them this should be all green like all the way up the stem they're not supposed to be this uh advanced i guess for this many weeks they're saying three to six weeks just to get the seed to pop out nah oh by the way this is an avocado but as you can see it's got multiple sets of leaves already one two three four or five it's already starting to get dark on the plant like you know like the bark and this thing is barely six weeks period from starting it see i kind of cheat i use my own soil there was a little bit of nice potting soil but nothing goes away so all these vines they're going to get all dried out this is what i do make my own compost okay take some old dried out leaves like whatever just crumble them back over that's it do that before you water them look what happens unbelievable anything anything will grow in this stuff i've tried everything all different kinds of seeds and things and it's pretty amazing i don't know i'll keep you posted on uh how this sucker does i'm pretty amazed considering that it has all these shoots already because according to all the websites they're not supposed to get shoots for like what 12 weeks and they're saying when you do get these side shoots you're supposed to clip them and when these open i'm supposed to rip out the little center piece of leaves just at the top so it'll prop gate better get a lot bushier i have to keep you posted see what happens yeah avocado farm it's all good okay so check this out um i found one stray piece of something living in the dirt that's a blade of grass there's some funky grass it grows where i got the dirt for this dad with uh all the compost and everything uh if you look real close check this out see little notches right here i cut these off completely like with scissors because you know for cooking and this is like less than four days from here to there that's the garlic here's the other one you can see this one kind of better cut there look at that one a whole new one shot up now somebody tell me what this is i believe it's rosemary because i do a lot of cooking and stuff but it seems to be growing out like a vine hmm you tell me you guys i don't know it go out of the dirt dead dirt there's supposed to be nothing in it it sat for weeks dried out nothing was alive i started growing stuff and there it is now here's the avocado this is like two weeks later not even sorry about the light guys there's all the leaves now it's pretty healthy got some new shoots coming in the middle and one two three four five little shoots i don't know if you can see this in front of my finger little shoots all over it now everything i've seen every video i've seen every one of these at this height are like pure green i hope the color shows up on this mine's actually red stretched out speckles or green like it's going dark like kind of a rust color all the bark on it and the tips of the leaves they're just starting to change now they're getting bigger instead of being uh they were kind of a pale white like this young shoot here i don't know if anybody knows tell me i'd like to know so it's going though what i do is to keep it going healthy about every day every other day i only turn it like maybe no more than five degrees like about like that so the plants on an angle like this looking out the window as opposed to out at 90. because we pretty much only get sun from that side as you can see we're blocked in by uh big trees so there you go i'll let you know how it goes definitely if anybody could tell me what the hell tag me holy that's back in the day dude okay now this is ghetto when do you ever see this airbrush accessory here's what it adapts to you're gonna airbrush with the power of the pressure in your tire"

weeb family you know how I don't get one of anything usually one or two or three or whatever but go ahead and show you guys this is the setup see if you guys can guess what I got in here well a few of you guys probably already know but this is the setup it's going to have a lot of humidity I got this really cool um frog Moss it's like a live uh grass that grows in the bottom down here and when uh you put the go Earth underneath it and you keep it wet it feeds the grass and keeps the grass alive I thought that was pretty cool so it's all kind of live things inside of here and uh gave it some nice little um artificial plant it's pretty artificial plants and really cool background and uh doesn't need a UV but I gave him one just in case but uh I like the enclosure the enclosure I got from a good friend of mine Two Friends uh Ron and Melissa off of my Facebook page really great guys uhoh did you see what that was maybe maybe not well I'm going give you a little hint here you see in the background yeah that's what I got I got me a little crusties you know let's see what we can get look at them that's one of them uh oh the glass is still a little wet so you can't crawl too well but uh see if I can get him look at him there's a little buddy that's one of them now I don't have a lot of information on them so please forgive me uh I got these guys at my local pet store so I like I said I don't have a lot of info but um I also got another one uh okay you see him right here yeah he's bright and red thinking about calling him red because his color is just so bright and red in color but these guys are such cute faces I know you guys are reptile people so you know what I'm talking about but the crusty geckos are really awesome pets now I probably will breed these two are a breeding pair male and female but they have the most adorable little faces now they don't have eyelids excuse me they don't have any eyelids so what they do is they uh lick their eyelids so that's one really cool feature one really cool uh trait about them so if you like your lizards to lick their eyeballs when they need moisturizing get you a couple crusties you'll never regret it now um they're also very low in maintenance so you guys know uh a bag of crusty food could last you almost a year they don't require the UVB but I do give it to them just in case you never know they don't require any heat cuz they can live at room temperature you don't want to freeze them of course so you want to keep a little bit of a good you know temperature I keep them at um let me see what is it between 70 and 80 you know you don't want to get real real hot cuz then they can get hurt you don't want to get too cold cuz you can freeze them so a good room temperature is proper for them and the humidity I I don't know if that's all correct but trust me it's pretty pretty moist in here as you can see the glass has moisture and all that Moss does as well so it's a lot definitely a lot more moist in here and that's why I don't really like these meters I mean they're nice and all but they really don't give you an accurate description of what's inside your enclosure they're for $12 you can get a good UVB I I'm sorry a good thermostat and um humidity meter for like $101 at Walmart and they're digital they can be set they can give you readings of you know throughout the night they're really great but here's the little guy I haven't gave him a name yet so I'm still thinking but they're so cute so adorable I love how they they hold on with their little feet now fun fact about these guys they have um like Feathering hairs on the palms of their feet and their hands and that's what allows them to to uh grip onto most surfaces so that's one really cool fact about them they can get really sticky but they're really just a bunch of hairs that are allowing them to grip onto most surfaces but look at the look guys and luckily he still has his tail um you will find some that have the tail missing and stuff and that's not like there's a problem that's kind of a common thing oh don't let him go there please don't go back here I got to try to stop them no they keep going up there I don't know why find it to be more enjoyable there but uh they're really jumpy as babies so I try to handle them as much as I can but I probably won't be doing too much handling because of all the jumpiness and movement that they give but I love those spots look at how spotty he is if uh anybody out there recognizes they the they're more for their type please let me know in the description I'm very very new to these guys so I'm still learning look at this guy here what are you doing buddy what are you doing he's so pretty I love their little faces and their cute little eyes there got to be the coolest thing ever that they lick their eyeballs for moisture look at this little guy super red I believe they told me this is going to be a female cuz she doesn't have any of the uh gentio sacks I mean pretty sure you guys know about crusty you know how to sex them they're probably one of the easiest all around pets I mean they're the easiest to care for they're the easiest to sex the easiest to feed I mean oh little guy jumped down and luckily he land landed on a nice soft bed of grass no pain little boy you okay bubble or girl little mama got hurt nope she's okay all her Tails there I'm

happening beautiful people my name is Dirty Mike and welcome back to the dirty RTG we're building squads we're talking about trading tips and we're focusing in on that game play if we can smash 1 th000 likes tells me to bring back another Road to Glory series I'm leaving it into you all's hands and I know it's been a while and that was because of Team of the Year where I had to get the blue cards I was opening a lot of different packs my regular content shifted a little bit but we're back to that razzled Dazzle that mainstream we're going to jump into games today because I know there has not been as much FIFA gameplay on my channel so hopefully today goes amazing also drop a comment as you can see in the backdrop that's my fitness Squad I want you guys to provide my next squad for main team as well as my next Fitness team so I'm going to replace both in the next episode I'm going to take user created Squad so either a link a screenshot something that goes to FootHead Down Below in the comments right now let's get into this free pack hype Griezmann on the front cover can we can we make it happen oh we get Marlos a little bit of a Skiller 3412 falow Bena hamz pretty high rated team here hopefully we can get him behind on the the backline oh finish finish near post hey oh you can't start a game better than that Wesley Snider five star weak foot first minute first attack em n did the providing all right this is a good build up can you see him oh that might get through oh Diego my man across the body oh I think that was going wide Costa oh that was awesome that skill Run finish finish there we go two n penalty yes oh oh that's unlucky that's why I don't rock with Casas man I just don't think Casas makes the saves halftime we're on that bread and butter hype 3-0 we just got a coasted in the second half oh it's a thing of beauty how can you not like Douglas Costa how can you not like them oh and we get the finish what the toe punch from god wow I didn't think dieo was going to reach out for that oh finish oh and we con seeed constellation for sure oh we're gone chip there we go game number one couldn't have went better we were smashing and dashing from kick start to finish we always were in control of this match all right so we're heading into match numeral dose and we're back to the main Squad the 433 hopefully we can keep killing and Skilling and we've got another 433 might counteract each other a little bit pretty solid BPL slide oh that could get through come on come on finish finish oh penalty yes yes yes yes woo no that's a Miss oh I can't believe that thought it was oh Mike Benz you got some making up to do bud that's a great ball and finish oh the sweat yes there we go and we're back we're back okay one n Ben AR is making things happen benma there we go couple little Nifty ball rolls uh once you get to swinging those down the sideline they're hard to defend at half it's been a matter of efficiency especially in the higher divisions we're in division four right now uh you've got to finish your 1 v1s and we've done that thus far okay Griezmann little drag back action oh a little ball ref ref how how is that not something no corner kick oh no corner kick back to the net and he's back in it 4411 ebra the center Center forward inform lacazette this should be interesting Bale oh here we go that's a turn across the body ref oh I can't believe that's not a call can he's trap trap tra tra tra oh finish finish yes oh benzamin you hardworking son of a gun that's what I'm saying oh you need those kind of things that happen in the higher divisions where he makes a mistake he doesn't even have CTO he has Larice I thought it was Corto my mistake but there we have it that's beautiful beautiful that's how you assist yourself easy it's a good ball in the Middle come on he's wide open there we go Benzema this is great buildup how are we going to get to the inside little body faint ball roll yes sir body faint oh lay it off finish hey that's back to back for you all day and diabi gets involved the attack it was all made by Griezmann though very nice sideline work as you guys watch a lot of my live stream Dirty Mike Twitch TV you see this happen with the razzled Dazzle mixup and bam oh give it to him oh cross body benma test him yep whip it whip it whip it whip it real good whip it real good don't pass it this time whip it real good yes yes oh a triple body faint in close control are you kidding me double Burba triple body faint not messing with it game set and match division four oh we're foring and whing look at that bam bam bam bam bam bam oh God chzn that's terrible luck I got the beautiful goal and I concede something like that 3-1 and half time I actually think the stats look better for him than the he have been but we've still got a match here got to close it out why is he so open mike damn shz big save buddy oh shz again oh these Corners that's fine oh diabi that could have been so nice finish hey once you get on Ben ARA's left foot man he's got that that just that tease of class I've said he's got the juice that special something in FIFA I know he's had kind of a rough year uh in real life but he's got the little H whatever it is man the finishing touch or just that extra we got the w got a coin bonus we actually more likely have 50 60,000 coins at least to play around with in terms of squad building so remember to drop that comment and we're going into division three we're scooting and booting try to keep that momentum just flourishing just flourishing we're 38 4 and four and as you guys can see possession is a major Foundation of my play style and I wish it was a little bit more important sometimes when I do get beat or I draw a match I'm 60/40 in possession in my favor uh pass accuracy almost at 80% the goal difference 3 to one things are looking pretty good uh if you guys enjoyed the content make sure to drop a thumbs up subscribe to my channel follow me on Twitter and Facebook at Dirty Mike USA and have a lot more coming for you ASAP ASAP"

will cover that at the end Jupiter and we're going to start out here with uh you may remember Randy from Texas who shot the 11th lunar wave um I want to run this he's only had a telescope since uh Christmas time and these were shot with his handicam and he's already catching interesting things and I want to State for the record I don't vet UFO footage um if I see something that's a blatant fake I may chime in but for the most part it's my opinion that on all strange objects you start with human technology and work your way in but anyhow here's some interesting objects he shot with the handicam but this next footage um while I'm not vetting it it's a crazy piece of footage um the quality is not great but nonetheless you're going to be watching the left side here and I'll Arrow it out and box it in there's the object object right there keep watching it's going to travel across the next crater and uh you know footage like this if this was crisp clear highdea footage it would be something to see um unfortunately the quality makes it a bit tough to uh to go much further than that but I wanted to show this um Randy and I have talked about tips on what I've learned on how to get your quality up and a lot of the eye pieces these days are actually Optical plastic from China they're junk so you have to be careful with your eye pieces but at any rate his footage is getting better I've seen it but this is a crazy thing you know it looks like it's almost right there at the moon and uh to be honest I don't think that that's really possible with everything that I've come to think is probably true nonetheless here's this footage so I mean everything we get on film helps us learn something and uh thank you Randy that's a heck of a catch and man it's too bad that wasn't sharp HD because uh it'd be something to see anyhow I went out last night and I shot Jupiter as you remember uh I've been witnessing Jupiter turning blue happened uh back in 2013 I believe and then I posted footage recently so what I did last night is I did some experiments what you're looking at here is what you have to do when you're taking a still to get the moons is overexpose the planet otherwise the moons get lost because they're not bright enough to keep Pace with a perfectly focused and uh you know when you adjust your F stop when you get the planetary disc in the moons disappear so that's what this is now what I'm going to do is just show a still or two here the seing was horrible last night we're having kind of a Santa Ana here uh the wind was kicking up the air has been very warm but it's interesting to see moons in this way so here is Jupiter through a 12 mm eyepiece using a projection method where you project out of the eyepiece into the camera um and the seeing was so bad that um you're not going to get too much better than this on a night like this now here's video run with a 26 mm eyepiece and I ran it for a long time and I saw no color change although you will notice in The Stills and in this video the Upper Limb uh maybe from the 9:00 all the way over to the 3:00 position there is a very slight blue tinge on every image I took last night um it may be tough for you to see once this is encoded because it's tough to see in the raw video in some of them now here I have taken the 12 mm eyepiece in the projection s system and ran video and you can maybe um see the blue now all the way bowing around from maybe 9 to 30 over the top there's a slight blue ring and so it's interesting there's clearly a lot of blue um going on in these images and I'm just not sure what to think I messed around with the camera you know ad nauseum last night trying to see if I could force a blue change and I could not but nonetheless there is a slight blue lip over the top of this planet so what I'm going to do here in a second is load a clip so I can demonstrate to you what you have to do to see the moon so here it's Overexposed you can see all the moons I'm going to adjust the iso of the camera and the F stop and the moons will disappear and the planet you know the bands and everything on the planet will come into Focus or maybe I should say whatever the heck we're looking at here and so then I just ran this for quite some time to see and even here you can see a blue tinge around the upper area so here it is thank you Jim from Vegas he has gifted me one hell of a gift in support of my work um I will talk more about this lens later I don't want to say what it is until I have it in my hands um it's a hell of a lens and it's from an eraone by in this country when they made quality stuff I posted another article today uh in response to the New York Times who is spouting nonsense um so there it is please come check me out on the Examiner um it's really the main way that I have to pay for all the filming editing and everything else that I do basically non-stop um in the last couple weeks I've been working seven days a week some of those days have been 12-hour days so there it is thanks for following me thank you for the support thank"
