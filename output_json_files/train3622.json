because he wanted to play a big part in the game he's been brilliant in training making sure everybody's been playing their part disappointment now he's got a support from the side Luis Figo going past Angus Deon here some support from Pao Deano Sean makes the side at his feet clb a little ball this from diano just want to call around the corner Mar he wasn't quite on the right wavelength Jonathan wils sheringham a scorer of the only goal so Faron is celebrated his 21st birthday on Wednesday they really did celebrate by accounted in by Craig David Figo running away from Jonathan WIS he slid it past Dez Walker in front Romario and here's a chance now for Palo and it's one one and the Legends combin there no answer for that combination between Lis Figo Romario and eventually Pao Deano with only 14 minutes of soccer a gone it's 111 well that will make the captain feel better Gordon it's a super goal you know well worked Mario sees Deano on his outside and it's a really clever finish by the Italian just lifts it over David Seaman there a good reaction this from the rest of the world one n down having lost their influential Captain his name has figured in the um well the speculative betting list for the next manager of West Ham United he did once say that he wanted to managed the club he left in 2003 after four years there I think by his own admission he's not ready for that kind of post but he's taking all his coaching badges that's certainly his ambition to figure in the game and all of the rest of the world players have been saying what an influence and what a teacher the Cano has been all week here's Lis figer to Romario that's brilliant from Figo and they've outnumbered England here but the Cross isn't quite good enough from Cabrera brilant football by figer though Portuguese Master applied his trade at the likes of Barcelona Madrid now Inter Milan you can see why still got the great touches soccer R is raising funds for Unicef and partners so they can reach many thousands of vulnerable children worldwide do please try to help us by calling 0844 8 two 88 call Cost 5 P per minute from a BT landline mobiles and other networks were very bra has come on place of Des Walker in the England defense Des Walker really keeps himself in shape he was telling me that he's pretty much at his fighting weight he's the same weight that he was in 1990 when he played in a World Cup semifinal but he's tweaked a a cve muscle in his left leg gra lasso will play at Center back alongside Ben Shepard and that's not the tallest Center back combination we've ever seen at Wembley they can talk you to death for them too there's Brian Lara straight to Angus Deon now Danny Jones knew what he was trying to do Teddy shingham was in support look Lively hasn't he down js on this right hand side FAL running at Craig David oh it's jabbed into the path of Nikki burn but Jamie red one all the way back with him it's going to be a corner kick Jamie rnap is the first player in Wembley history to have played for a team managed by his father with his pregnant wife on the touchline I checked that in the record books today it's never happened before corner kick to the rest of the world and Alan sheer is back there defending it's wild from Deano we can hear from the aforementioned Mrs rnap who's speaking to the father-in-law so Harry One all you've just made a substitution are all your plans going according to plan or a bit to call with Dez Dez Walker just tore his car from us which is a big blow Dez is like he's a fantastic player for us at the back he's you know obviously next International okay so you're still feeling confident not oh now he can be carry on it's okay Romario just missed his sitter not it was a miss it was a Miss Happ to a celebrity chef or a leag guitarist we be having a real life must remember this is a man who scored over a th career goals how how Robbie well when you scored a thousand goals you would think that this is an absolute gimme sh mourin was leaving it to him wasn't he I mean it was right on mourinho's right foot he just have to S at him we' got Pina on the floor injured now he's in agony oh dear now all those professional footballers around the country have dreamt of the day when the referee fell over the most famous referee has just fallen over not sure he's going to get up again oh that was awkward he twisted his knee there is a big medical room here at wendley it's just as well so far because Gordon Rams and desz Walker are already in there and they're going to have to clear a bed for Pierre Luigi Kina now Caro Deano wasn't anywhere near there was he famous for pushing over referees Theo is famously infamously banned for pushing over a referee at Hills re was actually at that game and oddly enough when he his ban was through and nobody quite knew what would happen to poo Deano Harry redard signed him two goals so far"

        "transcript": "hello guys Kevin Rogers for the crappie Academy I'm here to talk to you today about the ABCs of crappie fishing jig fishing in general kind of a jig fisherman during the tournament Trails it's the way I like to fish I prefer to fish that way do it all over the country uh right now we're in the dead of Summer one of the best times to go crappie jig fishing um it's my absolute favorite time to go jig fishing because the fish are uh you can figure them out pretty easy there isn't cold fronts Rolling In and Out in the spring and fall time so if you don't jig fish during the during the summer months man get out there and try it today we're going to talk about the lead head size the jig head size for what I do for my jig fishing um note while I'm talking here all of our jig fishing is done in dingy to Stained water so may not pertain exactly to clear water I don't i' stay away from Clear Water here in Missouri Kansas Oklahoma Arkansas Mississippi where we do most of our tournament gra fishing the water is dingy at least you can find some dingy water I like the dingy water because here in the summer months even when it's 100 degrees you can still go out and find crappie in in five to 10 foot of water that's why I like the dingy water so for our dingy water crappie fishing um something that we do a little bit unorthodox than most cppy fishing we use large lead heads this lead head right here is a 316 ounce Bobby Garland MoGo head that is our number one go-to lead head we start every tournament day with this size lead head and very rarely do we go down say to a smaller 16 oce uh we never ever ever jig with a 16 oce Bobby Garin head or or any lead head for that matter we just don't do it um we like the feel of the of the the larger Siz jig head you can feel it you keep track of that lead head a lot better and I guarantee you those large lead heads um do not scare off the crop so if this is something you haven't done try these larger Siz jig heads you can feel that feel that jig on that 10ft jig and pole a lot better um we've also been known when it's real windy to go to even a larger lead head than this Barbie Garland makes this in 32 oun up to 316 oun we'll go all the way up to a larger lead head all the way up to a half ounce lead head we have actually won tournaments um in Arkansas and Kansas fishing this half ounce lead head and that just freaks people completely out they think that's way too big to fish for Crappie absolutely false I mean you look at the size of that that's no bigger than a minnow not even close minow's 3 in that thing's little so don't be afraid of a qu ounce or a half oun lead head for and crappie especially if you're fishing 16t deeper deeper you can actually feel a lot better than this than this um this 16 PB head the only time we'll ever use is if we're trolling um when we're spider riging we actually have a bell weight above it we're just using it for a hook we never jig with this um so our go-to bait is a 316 ounce mow head um year round this is our number one lure so um what something we do a little bit different than most folks um is we never use an unpainted lead head and it amazes me that people still use an unpainted crappie jig head I don't get I don't understand it um always use a painted head and something we do we try to mix up the lead Head color with the body of the lure this is a Bobby girl 3-in slab Slayer black and pink one of my alltime favorites tip that with shirt Tru regardless of the tail color you still got black and shre there it gives a different contrast a different color here's another example of that here's a brand new color called penny back by Bobby Garland 3in slab Slayer and I got it on an orange head so um that's kind of the size we use the ABCs of jig heads for us large 316 ounce is our number one go-to you can just feel it so much better so give that a try um try those bigger Siz lead heads and make sure you're using a painted lead head too especially if you're fishing dingy water one little tip uh that we do with our lead head that I'll show you here new for Bobby Garland last year see that blade sliding up down my line that's called a crappie Tickler from Bobby Garland that's just a little bitty Willow Leaf blade I slide on my line prior to tying on my lead that's a shre color they make them in four different colors they come in a package sorted package um try that thing out that thing's pretty cool I've been doing this for several several years um and uh folks Bobby girl finally started making so you guys can go purchase these now they were hard to find what that does that slides up and down that line gives a little bit of flash little vibration hits that lead head makes some noise something just a little bit different again those are crop detect from so try that so that's my ABC's um my basic standard jig fishing lead head um always painted 316 o I like the bigger size because of the dingy to Stained water we fishing so hey make sure you go uh on Facebook and like the crappie Academy's Facebook page uh they're going to be throughout the summer giving you a lot of tips and techniques just about the basics of crappy fishing along with some some serious heavy Pro techniques as well on trolling and spider egg and planer boarding all that great stuff so and then also like this page on um on YouTube as well thank you I hope this helps your fishing"

        "transcript": "hi there i'm jules and in this video i'm going to show you how to make my super simple zucchini cake or actually kind of how not to make it so um yeah in the video i have a bit of a mishap you can see what happens i forget the flour uh but yeah so that's how not to make the cake but it'll give you the general idea and in the recipe i actually i'm using almond meal because i've made the cake quite a few times and i really prefer it with almond meal i just made it um the other day trying some gluten-free flour and it didn't work out so well so i mean it was fine but it just wasn't as good so that's the disclaimer up front um i hope you enjoyed the video for my uh zucchini cake is prepared tin so i've got a um sprinkle spring fondant i'm just going to get the baking paper this just makes it a bit easier to get the cake out and let's you could use oil um to oil but i i think by this thing in place but and i've got some here it's been out since breakfast so i'll just use that we just want to give it a nice thick layer and that just stops the cake from sticking 250 grams and then i've got a quarter of a cup of vegetable oil here so i'm just going to actually that's peanut oil so yeah whatever oil you want to use we just want something that's a neutral flavor i think it's going to be half a cup so we might just add a bit more um that'll probably make it up to about half a cup very accurate here but i've made this quite a few times and oh yeah it looks a bit dry so there you go half a cup of oil nothing to see here and that's mixed grain i'll break them into a little bowl so so um just give it a couple of good chuck bangs and then it'll crack and where that could have been they just put your thumbnails in and you want to open it up like a book and the trick is to catch the yogic um there we go and then the other trick is to make sure you put the yolks in there white's in the mixing bowl and we'll repeat that with two more eggs stir those yolks which is a in sugar mixture so it doesn't have to be too don't worry about it too much and then um this is just one zucchini that i've i've grated using the food processors it doesn't have to be that fine it's up to you uh and i find it processor it's kind of like not getting it dirty it's creating that much sleeping you can be in your ass but feel free to feel free to do it by hand if you prefer that is stirring a pinch of salt here that just helps to stabilize the egg white and i think i just lost the recording of that but what i've done is the egg white's got to soft peak so you can kind of see some egg white there so it's foamy um you haven't you haven't mixed it too much until it goes kind of foamy and firm and then i've just folded in half the egg white and then i'm just folding in the rest of the egg white now um there we go so and the action is kind of to scoop it over you want to be gentle-ish but if you get bits that aren't breaking up you don't want the lumps of egg white in your cake so just kind of squish them gently against a bowl but you want to kind of keep as much or as much air as you can so i'm just going to carefully pour that into the tin close as you can see lovely pretty bits of zucchini in there and i mean you could add nuts to this play around with it whatever you whatever you want chocolate would be lovely if you wanted to add some chopped chips or melt some chocolate and straight through or some cocoa powder heaps of different options okay now we're just going to pop it in the oven on the middle shelf um 1ac uh it's 3k so it's not my day today i just realized i haven't put the flour in this cake um that's happened to me before but not for years so what we'll do is we'll just carefully this isn't ideal too bad crunchy grams i think and i'm using some just some gluten gluten-free flour so i'll pop it in and i'll just fold the fold the flour in which the flour should have gone in when the um after i mix the zucchini in so it's silly girl and i've made this with almond milk instead of flour and it's really lovely so if you need to keep it gluten-free and you don't have any gluten-free flour that will work or if you want to keep it cheap and and gluten is not a problem just regular flour plain baking flour will be fine or purposeful okay this is not ideal so we're losing air here so this cake isn't going to be as light as i would like but anyway deja vu here so you can see there's a few lumps of flour because we but i don't want to lose on my air so i won't won't worry about those okay in we go and back into the oven it's been in for about 45 minutes so i'm just gonna have a look and it's feeling um kind of firm it's bringing on the edges definitely test it with this skewer okay so this skewer's come out and there's no liquid kind of sticky stuff on it so i'm thinking my cake's done so we're gonna turn it off and just going to rest it let's let it cool down you"

i'm reading in the news today that uh by 2050 the poland ranch camps will melt they'll be completely gone that's the bad news the good news surf's up and i'm sure by now you can tell that i'm a player that's right i'm suave i'm hot some of you ladies may even be having palpitations well you know i like to go to parties and smooth and carry on of course and one of the first things that people will notice about me is that it looks like i'm looking over here when i'm really looking over there this confuses everyone and they try to accommodate me by moving to the right so i turn to the right they move to the right again i turn to the vine again and the ultimate conclusion looks something like this now there's no clinical term for this but i like to call it the white house effect and when i want to be abused i let them go all the way around i try to smile when they go by now i've asked my doctor about this and he says i have what's called astagnus it's caused by brain damage great i still have the rest of my personality something else you might like to know about me is that i wear a hearing aid you know for the tender delicate moments when recording a fine woman or marriage and of course i had to explain to my doctor well what can he do for me i mean i'm pretty nervous he said well you have social anxiety disorder great what can you do for me then he gave me viper now when i go to social events i have a renewed sense of purpose and direction because well peeing is a real challenge now when people see that i'm wearing a hearing aid they like to test my hearing so what are they saying can you hear me now extra challenging they say a familiar response might be uh some of you may know that recently i got married uh i got married uh almost a year ago and uh prior to my marriage i was actually very shy and i would talk to ladies and i always had this fear that at some point in time they would mumble something instinctively i said what now if i say what they might think i'm distant blue stupid or maybe i'm just not suitable for me so i've been developing a comeback for example that sounded so beautiful could you please repeat that this worked great with the ladies but with the guys i got very concerned look last summer well actually in 2006 i went to vietnam and that is where i met my wife you see and no one told me that i would have to go to vietnam to get married but then you know i'm a geek i'm a nurse and that might explain some of it but i had a really great time in vietnam and one of the things i learned about vietnam is that it was really hot and of course the time that i went was in july and 2016 had this heat wave so i missed the heat wave but you know what when i was in vietnam i loved it because you know what i could sweat while sitting while thinking well just minding my own business but i didn't have to exercise this way and people would ask me really relevant questions like so scott are you hot well yeah and when i went to vietnam i met my wife alice and she wanted to show me around to all of her friends and her family which i think is a tradition in vietnam and i went to her sister's house her sister's name is ham which is not a normal name that would consider in america for a woman but in vietnam it's quite common so i was hanging out with him and i met her family her husband and her four or five kids i lost count okay they're very busy in vietnam i got to meet their dog little white fluffy thing gap yeah all over the place and the dog was checking me out and i thought okay the dog likes me and i i made a little announcement to the family i said you know your dog is checking me out and alex would you please translate to that to them you know and she explained everything and i said where your dog is going to come by within 5-10 minutes and he's going to sit on my foot and they're like oh yeah right and meanwhile they asked me wonderful questions like so have you ever wanted to alice but meanwhile we're watching the dog the dog walks up to me and he looks at me and he runs away and then he walks to the other side comes around walks up to me looks at me and runs away again and then he comes around for a third pass and he weighs his butt over my foot like he's not really sure if it's okay and then finally on the fourth pass he came and he sat on my foot and the whole family got really quiet and right then there i knew i'm in and that worked out pretty good now my wife is really coming along with english and one of the things that i notice at that from time to time uh i might not hear what she says now with an american woman she might become offended because i might be distant almost stupid and maybe i'm not suitable for maybe but with my wife it's just practice on the other hand my wife likes to play games and she has a great sense of humor and one of the things he'll do is to say what you say like i'll say what do you say and she'll say what you're saying why do you say what i say is there an echo in the room is there an echo in the room and then i'll say do you actually ride one of clay council what a great friend"

        "transcript": "what is up guys it is two pro for you games and in today's video I got the PlayStation 4 design it was just unveiled literally like seven eight minutes ago and it looks pretty good like it's it's not a great great looking console I thought when the PlayStation 3 came out that thing was freaking sexy but this thing it's in between it's it's not horrible I I just think it's good I think it's a good design I don't think it's the best I don't think it's horrible I think it's a good design now the top part of the console as you can see in the picture in the middle the top part of the console is that shiny black that the original PlayStation 3 was on the PlayStation 3 first came out it was like really glossy shiny black now that's the top part of the console looks like and then the bottom part of the console is just flat out like it's just black and there's a blue light separating those and really what what it looks like the best way to describe what this looks like is imagine if you have two pieces of wood you put one piece of wood on your table you put other pieces of wood on top of it and you take that top piece of wood and you just slide it back a little bit that's pretty much what the PS3 PS4 looks like and like a space in the middle I'm guessing where you can put the disc and maybe some USB ports we didn't really get a really good look of it they only had uh some pictures up on the screens and then he was holding it like this and it was not it was pretty hard to see but overall like I said at the beginning of the video the design isn't horrible it's not the greatest but hey it looks it looks okay to me and I could almost guarantee you guys that they're gonna be coming out with new designs for the PS4 just like they did with the PS3 in total for the PS3 where there were three different designs so I can guarantee you guys that there's gonna be some more designs coming out for the PlayStation 4 but for now it looks pretty sweet I'm stoked there's a ton of new games in the comment section below let me know what you think of the design of the PlayStation 4 and what you like better the design of the Xbox One or the PS4 be so"

        "transcript": "guys I need your help oh what is this I'm glitched inside of you I am glitched I can see your nose and your eye guys I need your help come on four four of us there were four of [Music] us so right now the record for me for the most amount of people in an elevator on Caspian border is in fact four as you saw in that little clip there it was really funny whilst we were doing that glossy was just on his own on the battlefield taking out all the enemies he was getting really annoyed at us but we were just seeing how many people we could fit in the elevator anyway today for you I've got five tips which you might not have known about Battlefield 4 these are pretty random I'm sure there's more out there but I thought these five were pretty cool and you might enjoy them anyway the first one is Battle screen now in case you didn't know battle screen is this cool little feature which is new to Battlefield 4 and is um via the Battle Log and it only works on next on PC but what it is is a nice little mini map you can get on your tablet or if You' got a dual monitor PC set up you can use it on your extra monitor now how you use it is when you're in a game on Battlefield you just go on Battle lock and then at the bottom where it says choose your load out look at your um server you're on or there's even an option for battle screen you click the battle screen one and then your whole map will pop up and it's really cool to use I wouldn't recommend using it as up from your alternative to the mini map as like it isn't as good and as detailed but it's good to see when you're playing conquest or something where all the enemies are or say you're playing rush and you want to know which objective is going to be the easiest to take you can just have a quick glance at it see where about all the enemies are and then you can um plan your battle um kind of situation after that and go in and try and get the kills it's a really nice thing to use I personally just use it on my iPad have it next to my screen or even just underneath it and then I can have a quick glance at it see what's happening on the battlefield then I'm go and choose my options accordingly now my next tip is about the rangefinder and whenever you are sniping you um normally don't put the range finder on or you or you do I don't know how you play but personally I don't I normally just have like the um variable Zoom or something else or laser sight I don't like using the range finder because I don't really feel that I go for many long range kills but sometimes I might be playing and I see lots of enemies by a far away objective and I want to snipe them all out but I'm really I'm missing all my shots and I am I'm feeling pretty bad so how you get a rangefinder as well as your normal attachments is you just go into a game you find battle pick up which has a rangefinder INB built pick it up and then drop it and then you'll have your Rangefinder inbuilt to your normal weapon as well as your secondary attachment in the clip here you can see it happening so um yeah just to understand how to do it but it is a real nice thing to do it is a glitch in the game but it's one you should use um with pride because you can just pick up the weapon then drop it and then you will have your inbuilt Rangefinder and you can go for those Ultra long range kills now my next tip is about your mega XP boost now normally you know about your XP boost I'm sure you've all got like 100 25 XP boost I know I've got quite a few with all these um Battle Packs we're getting every single day I've got so many to use and um whenever I'm playing I always make sure I've got a 25 or 50 XP boost available now um what you want to do is if you do get 100 or even a 200 XP boost you want to save these and wait for a double XP weekend now um during February we did have one every single weekend but normally if you're premium you will get one every single month so that's pretty cool and I do believe when a DLC is released um the weekend after that does have a double XP boost so um you just got to remember those and then once you do have those um available then just put on your 200 or 100 XP boost and you're going to get so much xp every match it's going to be great now my fourth tip which is kind of linked to the third tip is the ultra XP crme now with this tip you can be getting around 300,000 XP per game now when you do have this implemented whereby you are using your 200 XP boost as well as a double XP weekend what you want to do is make sure you've got quite a few weapons with um around 199 or 99 or around the 99 Mark kill whereby you've only got to get one or two more to get to the 100 Mark and then once you do get the 100 Mark you're going to be getting one of those medals or something and with that you're going to get loads of XP plus with the double XP and the rxp Boost you're going to get so much xp it's going to be great you're going to be racking up the levels I've done this once and I just leveled up so much did it on PS3 though have yet to do it on PC but on PS3 I just racked up so much it's a great tip to you use now my final tip is um something you should take note of cuz it is really annoying um something we haven't really seen in the FPS before or of my understanding we haven't seen and is the aim down sight hip fire now when you are hip firing you normally get that well you always get that really bad um accuracy I know if you've tried it like if you're going for a longrange kill hip firing isn't going to really work it's best to do it at Close Quarters but say you're going close close quarters you're hit prying and then you're using your lmg so you can carry on holding down that trigger but then you see someone at a long range and you aim down sights now your reticule might be directly on them and you might be thinking you should be hitting all the shots but you're not now the reason for this is the game is built so by when you do aim down sides whilst you're hit firing your shots will be still will still be in the hip fire mode so what you want to do is um when you're shooting when you aim down side just take your finger off the trigger and then put it back on once you're fully aimed outsid this will make your shots 100% more accurate they'll be going where you are aiming at know just make sure that you will be taking out the targets you should be taking out now that is it for all my tips for um just unknown tips that you didn't know about Battlefield 4 I'm sure there's more out there like I said before but I guess those would just be there for you guys to find out but these were just five which I thought you guys could um use but anyway I be hope you have enjoyed this video if you do like those cool little intros where I post a clip with me playing with a few of the other guys then just tell me in the comment section below but apart from that thank you guys for watching and as always I'll catch you on the battlefield"

        "transcript": "cousins I'm worried Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comes out August 8th and that's a subject that I've been talking so much about on this channel that once it's out I won't have any more to say about it that could be it what other popular franchise that I like so much we'll ever get any more movie information that I can actually talk about on camera hold on a second Power Rangers gets writer and executive producer I'm back in the game baby [Music] of course I was going to talk about Power Rangers what you think I was going to talk about Thor being a woman you don't know me hi I'm Andre and I'm a black nerd so a while back it was announced that lion gate was going to be heading up a Mighty Morphin Power Rangers reboot but of course hearing that a Mighty Morphin Power Rangers reboot movie was going to happen even with Lion's gate name behind it you could be like okay whatever wait for hell to freeze over before that gets produced development hell but this news came out recently that they actually got an executive producer on board and writer so that means all right this is going to be a thing we're going to have a mighty more from Power Rangers movie it's happening at some point in the future but it's happening it's real yo now the executive producer they got is a guy named Roberto Ori or ory Orco I'm going to call him Orco Ori has writing credits on The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and seen it and a lot of you still keep telling me Andre you got to go see Amazing Spider-Man 2 you got to review it even though it's been out for over 2 months you got review it Orco he worked on Spider-Man 2 whole Spider-Man franchise was supposed to work on Spider-Man 3 and Venom left that to go work on Power Rangers Spider-Man American Icon been around for several years stanle classic excelr Power Rangers been around for like 20 years on Fox kids network and Nickelodeon and jedx Spider-Man Sony Mark web Andrew Garfield Emma Stone Jamie Fox leaving that for lion gate to work on a Power Rangers movie it's official Power Rangers better than Spider-Man shots fired Arco is going to be developing the story along with two writers Ashley Miller and Zack stin now here's the types of movies that they've worked on in the past Star Trek all right Star Trek in darkness all right Transformers oh God admission impossible three okay okay he brought me back he brought me back Thor thumbs up and X-Men first Class H well X-Men first Class is not a bad movie per se it's just if Darwin is any indication from that movie of how we should expect the mighty war from Power Rangers movie to be uh I'd be worried if I was the black Ranger oh and Transformer writer behind this too oh Jazz and Darwin Oh Black Ranger you're going to die in this movie of course saon is going to be behind producing the film because I am saon and so is Allison Shermer I like to say her name Shermer who oversaw a little film franchise known as The Hunger Games what I hear that's big still hadn't seen it one day one day y one day and she's also doing the liveaction Cinderella which is makes sense because that involves people unlike the live action Dumbo I've already talked about that now say what you will about these people and the movies they written you know some of them I like some of them I'm like like eh but it does bring up one good thing they are taking this seriously they could have easily gotten like some TV writers from Power Rangers to just be like all right you're going to write a featur link version of it but the fact that they're getting writers from X-Men first Class Thor even Transformers the fact they're getting people who have written big budget movies proves to me they want this to be a thing to where whether you're a person who has loved Power Rangers for the past 20 some years or if you are Vaguely Familiar with it or watch Nickelodeon version or if you're just brand new to this thing that you can watch this and accept this in the same way as you would accept any comic book film now look I'm not expecting Marvel quality from this thing come on let's be real here I mean I love the Power Rangers but let's admit it's cheese I'm not expecting the next Iron Man here but the fact that they've got quality writers I'm just hoping that these are the people that did the good things cuz there's there's good things in all those movies listed I'm just hoping these are the people that did the good parts of those movies and not the bad parts of those movies but of course this still leaves the biggest spots left open who's going to be the director of this movie and who is going to star in it who will be the cast and let me just clarify some rumors right now okay stop telling me that you've heard news about the cast of Power Rangers no one has been cast for this movie okay what happened was MTV wrote an article when they got announced that they were making a Power Rangers movie and they thought for fun they would make a cast list of who they would like to see as Power Rangers and then some other blogs who can't read didn't realize that it was just them having fun and trying to promote that stuff as fact and then I get freaking emails and tweets and Facebook messages every single day going hey Andre did you hear that Liam Hemsworth and chlo morat are going to be the new Power Rangers they're not it was something that MTV made up the same article said that Merill Street was going to be Rita repulsa and K and Peele were going to be bulking skull you can't take that seriously just because it's on the internet it ain't freaking true one more person sends me some article talking about how Michael B Jordan is the new Green Ranger I'm going to slap you with my dragon dagger and you can take that leral or figurative or in your window however you want it but either way your face going to get slapped with something that's dragon dagger in size shape and scale that's pretty much it that's all I have to say right now just again I'm just glad that they're actually taking this seriously I hope this ends up being a good film my fingers across with how this would work out the big question is going to be how hardcore will it be is it going to be like a PG-13 dark gritty thing is it going to be aim more towards children but just be a little bit more serious I mean is it going to be very comedic you know will it be kind of funny silly wacky um we don't know I'm very curious to see what turns out with this but it's just nice to know that they're not just going hey let's get the guys who wrote mega force or Samurai to write this thing cuz that would made me concerned I mean no offense to those shows they're great for Nickelodeon but we talking big budget movies here you're playing with the big boys now playing with the big boys now oh that's pretty I just made a prince of Egypt reference go me so what do you think cousins is the news that these writers and executive producers who have worked on other big budget films now working on Power Rangers that just excite you are you concerned based on their past writing credits how does this make you feel who do you think should direct and who do you think should be cast in The Power Rangers movie leave your thoughts in the comments have fun thumbs up this video and if you're new here tickle that subscribe button I make new nerdy videos all week every week I love you like a play cousin I'm add 5000 chain chomp It's morphin time yo"

started okay the first question is thing you cannot leave the house without um the one thing that I probably couldn't leave the house without would be my phone I go everywhere with my phone I mean I can't really leave it at home I feel disconnected from the world but um yeah so the one thing would be my phone U next question favorite brand of makeup well I think I've stated this before in one of my other questions videos but um my favorite like drugstore brand would probably be Revlon cuz I really like the quality of their products L'Oreal hip collection's pretty cool too for a more upscale brand I would probably have to choose Mac of course because I love Mac what's your favorite flower my favorite flower would be the Orchid I love the Orchid it's just so unique and they come in so many different colors and they're just so pretty I love them favorite clothing store Forever 21 most likely I love all their clothes and it's really reasonable prices and good quality clothes favorite perfume I don't really wear a perfume that much because I feel like it never stays on me for some reason like no matter how much perfume I put on I feel like I don't ever really have a scent when I put it on but maybe that's just me um but if I did have to pick one I would say Burberry Brit I really like this smells it's not like a fruity smell but it's more of like a spicy spell and I usually like Fruity smells I also like um Victoria Secrets love spell I love that smell it's such a good smell okay heels are flats I would have to say heels I'm only 53 so I wear heels all the time because I prefer being taller um I have really short legs so I try to make my legs look longer all the time uh yeah I usually wear heels very rare occasions I'll wear flats I mean unless I'm like going shopping at the mall or walking for long periods of time I'll wear flats but if I'm not doing that I'll I'll wear heels all the time do you make good grades um yeah I made pretty decent grades in high school that's all I have to say about that uh favorite colors my favorite color has to be green most likely it was purple when I was little um I also like pink I really like any color like lately my favorite color has been yellow so I go through stages do you drink energy drinks I used to drink Red Bull like all the time I was like living off a Red Bull um but it started to make me really anxious and like the caffeine yeah it makes me really anxious and jittery and I didn't like that feeling do you drink juice I love juice I love like any kind of juice orange juice I've been drinking cranberry raspberry juice lately it's really good I get the light kind cuz cranberry juice just the regular kind is kind of harsh um I like the light kind do you like swimming I love to go swimming swimming um the only time I really go swimming is in the summer and if there's like a lot of people with me um or when I'm laying out do you eat fries with a fork okay that's a really random question no I do not

too thick it uh protects your skin from the sunlight and um it's non-comedogenic and it's fragrance-free so it's really good for like sensitive skin and I really like it a lot so that's the moisturizer that I've been using for my face for a body moisturizer I've been using this Ginger Citrus um body butter and this is by a brand called Arbon right there and um I'm not really sure I don't think you can purchase this anywhere in stores but if you go to the website I know you can get this this is actually their only um body butter that they have so it's only this scent but it's really thick and creamy and the smell is like unbelievable I love the smell it wouldn't like ginger Citrus doesn't really sound like it would be a really good smelling body butter but I really like this body

        "transcript": "hey guys um today I'm going to teach you how to do the four actually three basic um stitches for sewing and how to sew on a button first we will start with the running Stitch the running Stitch is probably the simplest Stitch there is so at every string you want to tie a knot at the end and when you thread it through the needle automatic Neal threaders really help with that you want to leave a bit at the end okay so I'm going to start on the top just so you guys can see so you go all the way through with it until it hits the knot and then you flip it to the other side and go through again and pull it all the way you want it to be tight so like this and then you go back again on the other side sometimes the string will get tangled so it starts to look like that and then you'll flip it to the other side again and go through so this is probably the easiest Stitch there is and it's also the one we use to do the Jean purses so there's that that's the basic running Stitch it's really simple and really fast to do and now we will sew on the button so we have a full four hold button and so we'll start from the bottom oops so we want to place the button and hold it on you go through one of the holes sometimes the string will just get tangled everywhere so it's like that and then you can go diagonal or right beside like to go diagonal and then you go through another hole and then you go up sometimes it's hard to find the hole so you go up into another hole and you want to pull really tight and then you'll go down the last hole so that's how you sew on a button and do the running Stitch so we'll just cut this and usually you tie not but yeah we'll just cut it for now okay now we will do the overcast Stitch so I'm going to put it together like that just cuz when you're doing the overcast Stitch there needs to be two things together well mainly with all sewing so you take your needle this is the thinner thread we're using and you pull it through until it not hit hits and then you just pull it back over and go through again like that and you keep doing that so it's another really easy Stitch so that's overcast Stitch it kind of looks like candy cane stripes a little bit and now we'll do the blanket stitch so again you want to put it together with the string the blanket stitch starts out like an overcast Stitch you go through and then come back and instead you go through the string like this and you do that again I'll show you again take it and you go through the little Loop that's there and it has like a line over top if you can see it all these stitches are pretty easy so there it is again so you're going to go through the fabric put your needle through the loop and pull so those are the three basic stitches and how to sew on a button see you next time"

        "transcript": "for more information check out my blog thy.com follow me hey guys in today's video I'm going to show you this really beautiful but simple New Year's Eve makeup look I skipped the glitter this year because I know not Everyone likes to wear glitter and I personally am not a huge fan of glitter on myself I think some people totally look awesome in it but for me personally I just love High shine and glowing skin so if you guys want to see how I got this look please keep watching so I'm starting with my eyes I'm using this eyeshadow from Kiko which is absolutely beautiful I'm just wetting this with my Mac charged water so I get intense shine and I'm applying this all over my entire lid and in the inner corner I already have my face makeup done I have my Foundation concealer and Contour done so yeah that's why we're working on the eyes first I love this eyeshadow it's so metallic and I personally prefer super high shine metallic eyeshadows over glitter that's just my personal preference I think glitter is beautiful as well but on me personally I just really like metallic looks so after I pop that onto my lid I'm going to take this color by L'Oreal and pop this into my crease this is going to warm up the crease a little bit and add a little bit of definition and this is also a really shiny metallic color I'm using using this dry I'm not using it wet because I don't want metallic in my crease well super high shine metallic in my crease I just want a little bit of Shimmer in my crease so that's what I'm doing and that was me so excited over how metallic this is like I love it so much it's such a beautiful color if you have a Kiko near you you really need to get these eyeshadows they're awesome so just blending this eyeshadow all over the entire lid getting it into my inner corner and then going into the crease with that L'Oreal infallible eyeshadow that I talked about a little earlier this look is really simple you're going to be like wow this is so basic but this is something that I would totally Rock it's simple but I feel like it really packs a punch and now I'm just going to line my eyes with my NYC liquid liner and as always I like to start my eyeliner in the center of my eye first and then work on the outer and inner corner so I'm just creating a wing with this and building up on this um I'm creating a pretty elongated Wing um you can go as short or as big as you'd like and the thickness is a medium thickness it's not super thick or very thin then I'm just going to line my waterline with a nude color eyeliner because I want the eyes to appear big and doll-like next I'm going to take my pencil brush and I'm going to dip it into that Kiko eyeshadow that we applied all over the lid and this time I'm using it dry and I'm running it along the inner corner and the inner third of my lower lash line for a little bit of a highlight once you do that the entire makeup look is done it was really easy right um I'm just going to grab my mascara I'm using L'Oreal carbon black voluminous falsy be lashes and telescopic all product names and details will be in the description box below like always as well as a list of all the brushes that I'm using I'm not applying anything onto my lower lash line because I want to keep that pretty bare the only thing that's going there is mascara [Music] I personally like topheavy Lids when I'm wearing such a neutral look I think it looks really pretty you can apply the L'Oreal eyeshadow or even the kiko eyeshadow on your lower lash line if you'd like but this is just how I like to wear it so just working on my mascara you guys know I like three different mascaras and now I'm going to work on my face my Contour is already done I'm going to take this really beautiful baked blush by NYX and I'm going to pop this onto my cheekies this is such a beautiful color it's one of my favorite pink blushes ever it just has the most beautiful luminous glow and just popping that on to my cheeks I love this makeup look I like I said before this is probably one of my go-to makeup looks if I want something a little fancier I just really like how the skin is glowing the eyes are metallic it's really simple I feel like it's very doll likee and I just really like it so after I apply my blush I'm just going to blend it out a little bit so it's not so harsh then I'm going to take this highlighter by Le vaer it's slightly pinkish tone and I'm just going to highlight my face with this so I'm going to start off on the tip of my nose then I'm going to go between my brows above my brows my Cupid's bow and the high points of my cheekbone this is really going to add light to the face add lift and it's going to give you such a beautiful skin look like you are glowing that pregnancy glow without having the baby so just popping that on this is such a beautiful highlighter if you can get your hands on it I totally recommend it it's is stunning then once I do that I'm going to work on my lips I'm just going to take the foundation off of my lips and I'm going for a very matte lip because everything on my face is so shimmery and my eyes are so shimmery so for my lips I'm just going to be lining them with this makeup store lip liner and filling them in entirely with the makeup store lip liner I am not using any other lip products so just filling in my lips and lining my lips and once that's done we're good to go this is a really pretty color it's very similar to whirl by Mac it's just not as deep as WHL it's a little bit more pink instead of deep pink I suck at describing colors like terrible what am I doing with my life anyways filling my lips in as you can see here and making such a nasty face if you're wearing just lip liner I really suggest you put on a lip balm before you do so that your lips don't look really dry cuz lip liners can make your lips look a tad bit dry if you just put them on without a lip balm so once the lips are done I'm just going to apply some mascara onto my lower lashes my husband was making me laugh in the background and you don't make someone laugh when they're doing lower lash mascara it's just a crime so just popping on some mascara and once you put some mascara on your lower lashes the entire look is done I hope you guys enjoyed this video please give it a great big thumbs up if you did it really helps me out subscribe if you're not and I will see you guys in my next one bye [Music] [Music] [Music]"

        "transcript": "hey there everybody let's got her here today I hope you guys are doing great I'm out here playing with solar lights yay actually these are some solar lights and I realized you probably can't see me but you can probably see the light and these are some that mom had and she was gonna chuck them she was gonna throw them away because they weren't working anymore so I got to tinkering with them and got them to work it again and these are just the kind that you stick in your garden you know or on your walkway or whatever just you have a little life but I was gonna mention just real quick that these are probably pretty good to have because in a pinch in Abeka they will put out a little bit of light so if you ever find yourself in a power outage you'll have these that will work in the dark even in the daytime if you're in the house or something in the dark especially at night of course they'll work better so get you some garden solar lights because these are good to have as a backup now I'm not turn the light on here hey now you can see me we want to talk to you guys about today in this video is a buddy of mine his name was Lamar and he runs the solar cabin YouTube channel and Lamar has done a lot of research and has spent many years of his life studying off-grid living solar cabins survival preparedness and things like that he's got a great channel for you guys to check out in the link to his channel is going to be down below in the more info section Lamar has written a book and it is about solar living in homesteading and he has got a great deal for you guys that I wanted to tell you guys about and hopefully get you excited about it the book is written he's written a hardcopy book and I believe it's about close to 200 pages long and it has got plans in it for how to do all kinds of homesteading sustainable living off-grid living solar living and he's got some amazing stuff he teaches you how to build a solar cabin for less than two thousand bucks and you guys have really got to see this if you haven't seen it it is fantastic he basically shows you how to build a little tiny house it's about the size what I would wait till like a garbage garden shed but in that one size little tiny house it is a full living workable house and it's a great solution for those of you who are looking more into homesteading especially farther out into the wilderness it can be fully sustainable through solar energy and you can build it for less than 2,000 bucks now in the book he teaches you he gives you all the plans of how to do that he also teaches you how to make things like solar composting solar generators gardening equipment solar backup things just all kinds of stuff I there's so much stuff in it I can't even remember everything that's in it it's right off the top of my head and the reason that I'm telling you guys about this is because from now till April 28th so you don't have much time you need to hurry up and go over there on his website he is offering the eBook version of this is the downloadable full version of the book for one dollar PayPal all you got to do is just have a PayPal account send him one buck you get the full downloadable version of his book which is great price because the book sells for about $20 so I want you guys to run over the link is going to be down below and it's the solar living website and I'm going to show you guys that link down below and I'll put a little blurb about which one it is and you guys run over there and get this this is a great great tool for you guys to have for those of you who are looking more into the off-grid living survival preparedness things like that especially if you're looking more a little bit towards the future because because you want to have yourself prepared and your family prepared and you want a place to go or be where you can be maybe further out in the wilderness maybe up in the mountains I'm somewhere like that where you and your family will have a greater chance of survival should if and when things in the future get kind of hairy and crazy so visit Lamar's YouTube channel the solar cabin channel and then please do go grab your version of the e-book like I said it's one dollar PayPal but this is only gonna last until April 28th and then he's gonna pull it off and he's gonna start charging full price again and I believe full price for the e-book is seven dollars and the hardcopy book is twenty now if you want a hard copy book you can order that off of his website - I personally intend to work better with a hard copy version but a lot of people in this day and time work well with eevr with ebooks and the e versions of things like that because they can just print them off on their computer so but this is like I'd have one I'll have a lot of links in it - a lot of resources I know one of the things he also talks about in the book is sources for finding cheap land for those of you who were worried about land in the price of land he's got a lot of sources for finding cheap land for off-grid living for homesteading and things like that just ton of information in there Lamar's a really nice guy I've known Lamar through some of the yahoo groups that he and I are in on the homesteading front I've known him for quite a while good guy right information works with homesteader news they put out just a ton of information for homesteading survival stuff like that so check out his website and grab your ebook for a buck while you can cuz like I said it's going to go away on April after April 28th so you need to get it quick and I hope this guy helps you guys out I just wanted to share this information with you because I know a lot of my subscribers are into the homesteading thing and some of you are trying to learn as much as you can right now about it so go over there give them a visit grab his eBook and maybe get a hard copy of his book if you want as well and tell him I sent you you guys take care we'll talk to you later god bless and bye bye for now"

        "transcript": "what's going on guys Jos Q here and I'm going be showing you guys how to get Franklin's buffalo or any other single player car that you want uh into GTA online so all you're going want to do here is do what I'm doing on my screen and go over to the Los Santos customs um now once you do this go to uh pause go to online go to options and then go down to last spawn loc like last location and like make that your uh your spawn location and that'll make it so when we come back into GTA online you spawn right here and the Buffalo does not um disappear or any carard that you have next go to your character um like selection tool and go to the character of your choice for whoever's car you want I chose Franklin so you're going to spawn over at his house at least you should if you don't then either you could try it again or just drive to his house from wherever you're at you might spawn at like a club or something but you should spawn at his house if it's your like first time going in a single player for the day um so once you spawn here walk outside go next to your vehicle of choice mine is the buffalo go next to this I believe I get inside it um which is wrong I think I yeah I get inside but then you see I get out of the vehicle so what we're going to do here is uh you're going to press pause go to online go to GTA online and go to invite only session now that's the crucial part it has to be invite only and once you do that you should spawn back into GTA online and grab a vehicle off the road and uh or or it could be in the parking lot it could just be any vehicle that is not too hot to modify meaning you can put it into Los Santos customs and if you wanted to you can make it your own which we're not going to do now one thing I forgot to tell you in the beginning was you have to make sure that you have no vehicles outside right now um you have to make sure that all of them are either destroyed or in your garage I made sure all of mine were just in my garage so I fix everything first but you could either have them destroyed or um in your garage now once you're in here you're going to want to go to the Xbox gamer store and as soon as you see the screen that you're seeing right now unplug your ethernet cable or turn off your Wi-Fi from your router um and once you do that it'll come up with this message right here cannot connect to uh the Xbox or whatever press a and then it'll say this sign in Xbox Live and then it'll say return to GTA um Grand Theft Auto 5 single player or whatever you're going to press a and then it should bring you back to uh single player back to Franklin's house or whoever's house you were at in the beginning and now you bring his car to Los Santos customs again as you're seeing on screen once you get to Los Santos customs you're going to want to take the car and put it up inside the door but you want to do it like so it's not fully in just the front of it what this will do is it'll make it so when you go back into GTA online that the door will not be closed and you could actually bring the car inside and it kind of glitches it out so now you're going to want to sign back in make sure you plug you know your your uh Ethernet or turn your Wi-Fi on and then sign back into Xbox Live Once you have the car in position and then go to GTA online line make sure you go to invite only session again and then load up the game once you get here the car should be just sitting there because that is where you left it at and this works for uh the patch that we're on right now I don't really know I think it's like 1.09 so it works for right now I know that for a fact I've done it for a few people already tonight um so when you run over here like I said before it's going to be just sitting there with a door propped open it still thinks that you're Frank so it's going to let you go inside and that's why normally if you didn't leave it there I don't believe it would have let you go inside it's the bravado Buffalo sports edition one of my favorite cars it's just it's like a unique car I don't think there's any other like it like there's the Buffalo but it's not like this now when you do this you could put um the the protection on the car now I didn't realize at the time but when you put protection on the car it puts it in your garage right it like makes that a separate one and then if you start fixing up this car and you go put this one in your garage it gives you a second Buffalo so right now I've got two buffalos in my garage um and that's why you see when you get right here it's making me replace one vehicle again and I replace one of my adders which probably not was a which was probably not a good idea but uh I do that anyways and uh now I've got two of them which is kind of interesting so I've got two buffalos if you guys want to do this with any of your vehicles you can do with any vehicle from single player um like you could use the Trevor's Truck which has like the teddy Bur on the front so that's kind of interesting and unique one you can use it with the Buffalo you can use it with any vehicle you want hopefully this this helped you guys out because I know a lot of people did not know how to do this on the Xbox because uh people were making videos for PlayStation 3 so this is one of the first ones for Xbox hopefully this helped you out guys and if you

        "transcript": "all right let's take another quick look at the tashiba tg1 here we are on the main home screen I have found a few weird issues with this handset uh when I'm making a phone call for example if the screen does go black it's almost impossible to end the call you'd have to basically turn the screen back on which is a slight annoyance um also I found that the um tilt mechanism here you can f you can turn the phone on and find that the phone is is like that which is a little bit tricky for making phone calls you know you basically turn it on and you find that it's in landscape mode like that and you're trying to make a phone call and you have to wait for it to rotate back around and realize that it's actually um in portrait mode or it should be in portrait mode and it's a little bit annoying but um here we are with the browser this is a new version of Internet Explorer by the way we can use this zoom bar at the bottom here to zoom in uh you may have just seen that zoom in like that so drag it to the right and it Zooms in drag it to the left and it zooms out or you can use these buttons here on the bottom zoom out and zoom in on the bottom there um so that's a new version of Internet Explorer by the way it's it's a bit it renders slightly quicker and you can drag around a little bit like Opera so you can do that it's very easy to look at websites and find the necessary bits of information that you need um you can just tap in URLs here with the onscreen keyboard it's very easy to use this onscreen keyboard you can easily use that way or you can flick it around and have it in the wide screen mode and so if I just turn the keyboard on and we go to dubdub dub dot um google.com I haven't used the stylus in this demo because uh it's at home um obviously as I mentioned in the earlier video there's no way to put the St on this particular handset um which is a very very thin handset I must admit the Toshiba Hardware is um faultless I can't fault it at all it's a 1 GHz processor it's got GPS it's got Wi-Fi um it's very nippy indeed although the Tilt sensor is driving me slowly insane um you can turn that off with the settings uh and then system I believe it is and motion sensor settings here you can also activate the shake oper ation so if I turn that on you can shake it to go to the today screen or answer a phone call and you can turn off the autoc screen orientation change which is you know something that I would maybe want to do but that's a great thing about Windows mobile you can turn these things on and off if they do drive you mental um you got this video quality setting mode here which is set to fine as uh as as default but you can go to normal or turn it off and um we've also got power saving settings which I may have may change to uh make my phone calls work a bit better um best performance power saving customer temporary we've got uh the master clear button which just resets it back to default GPS settings um here we can adjust the motion sensor you see and we can use the g sensor and we can adjust it if it's not responding accurately so if you put it in flat surface and the ball is slightly off center like it is here I can press adjust and it will adjust it back to the center and complete the adjustment there we go we're in the center now so you can use that installed programs on the tg1 include obviously cor player which we saw earlier a contacts backup system here uh Adobe Reader for reading a PDF uh home screen selector which again I showed you earlier so we can either have that Toshiba system here or we can have the orange panel there um internet sharing orange orange Maps which I can't show you right now and we need to be outside for that and uh we got this photo base system which is what you may have seen on the demos where you can um sort of click on a picture if I click and hold on a picture there and you can zoom in pressing the plus button here and zoom out pressing that you don't use the zoom bar strangely enough the zoom bar sort of flicks you um from one picture to the other by the looks of it so you can zoom in and you can pan around photographs or you can set it to um do a nice slideshow so you can show people your photos um if you wish and that's a great thing about this it does play videos it displays photos very well it's because of the capacious screen um browsing the internet is just a dole really it's really nice to browse the internet on this phone um the I think it would benefit unfortunately and I have to say this unfortunately I think this phone would benefit greatly from having a different ROM uh and a ROM possibly with bits of HTC software in it uh I really have to say that unfortunately it would benefit greatly from having a different ROM because this unfortunately is Windows Mobile 6.1 with a a slightly cool interface on the front and core player and that's about it and we've got this orange video player here which lets us well it's basically core player so I can click on a video here we' got that video that you get on every Windows mobile phone pretty much plays MP4 MPEG uh WMV format we've also got a video editor so you can make your own videos with the uh camera around the back um and Windows Live we got Windows Media Player as well and that is about it unfortunately obviously you can install your own um software uh should you wish um we've got all the orange tweaks on here orange maps and TV and video here if you press TV and video it goes to the orange um orange World page which you need to be an orange customer and be on an orange connection to do that you can't do that over Wi-Fi and um we can obviously flick between these panels which I showed you earlier so we can go into my music my pictures my video we can have a look at the calendar and um my contacts Etc just press press it once and you can add your own stuff into there as well so that's a quick look at um the Tosha tg1 software"

        "transcript": "hi it's dorine and this is your weekly oracle card reading for April 6 through 12th I'm here in the organic garden that Michael and I started and I wanted to tell you that about 20 years ago the Angels very clearly told me to go organic and they had me at the time my kids were young get them on organic and we all went through a big shift in energy when we got off of pesticides the Angels taught me that pesticide really means kill and they said that was too harsh of an energy for those of us who are sensitive so I'm so glad I listened to them and another thing that they told me was that I was to grow my own organic garden and they said that as many of us as possible who can do that that the locally grown especially from your own yard synchronizes you with the timing of the world and they said the key to success is good timing and if you can pull a carrot out of your own yard and eat it they said it's like having a newspaper delivered to you of the news of your local area in terms of energy and it really as I said just synchronizes you and you know even if you live in an apartment you can still grow organic produce on your balcony or they've got Hydroponics very inexpensive online now it's really easy to do and it's some of the best foods you'll ever eat I eat out of this Garden every single day and it makes me feel so energized and because of that I wanted to work with the magical messages from the fairies oracle cards this week the fairies are what I call the nature Angels because it's like the old book of the talmud the old sacred text that says every blade of grass has an angel bending over it saying grow grow and it's true all of our plants all of our flowers they all have angels with them and so when you're outside in nature you're actually connecting with the nature Angels sometimes called the fairies these are trustworthy beings who are made by God to help us all and so I've got a deck of 44 cards here with messages from the nature angels for this week guidance for you what to expect and I'm asking the Lord to guide us all in help us to know what's up and how we can be of service and so I'm praying over these cards I'm looking for cards that are standing out that's Monday Tuesday and this one wants to come for Wednesday Thursday and then one more for the weekend and here it is all right let's take a look and see what to expect 6th and 7th of April do some research comes up there's a picture of a of a woman or a fairy on a stack of books and so they said some of this has to do with feeling overwhelmed because you're excited about some ideas they're saying that you're doing a lot of research online and you may also be thinking about writing a book and so that's coming up very very strong this is a card asking you not to go into overwhelm about these ideas you're excited about remember we've just gone through a very powerful intense Easter time where we let go of a lot in the beautiful pink full moon and so now you're all cleaned out you're detoxed energetically and so ideas are going to be just pouring in and these are ideas that have been there and you're going to feel a lot more confident a lot more excited it's natural but you know one step at a time do research that's laying the the groundwork of what's next and let's see how this fits into context with with the middle of the week you've got the power they're showing me that the picture and I've never actually interpreted this card this way is a fairy balancing on a very fine it looks like a spider web tight RPP and they said you've balance is key right now they said you can balance you've got the power to balance but you have to take your power to get that balance they're telling me there's still some more things to be released that are standing in the way of your total happiness and you already know what they are and it's time to let them go they said because life a lot of times is the path the straight and narrow where you are on a tight RPP like this walking on that narrow path you can't afford to have distractions so the distractions in your life right now at least have to be set aside and you've got to focus on the power you have a lot of this is because the ideas you're getting are coming from God and you enacting those ideas are part of the solution for all of us we all benefit from this it's interesting Autumn comes up as the weekend now of course our friends in Australia and New Zealand happy Autumn it's a new season for you so it's a it's a message about now about now this is also a message for those of us in the northern hemisphere to prepare for the Harvest so the Harvest is considered Autumn time when all the seeds you're planting will reap your reward so what they're telling us is that have patience and trust that every little step that you're doing right now is leading to those rewards to that Harvest it's just like when Michael and I planted this Garden we put the seeds in we we're tending the crops every day it takes patience to grow a garden and have that that reward of the food in this case but in your case it's going to be these ideas the patience is doing research the patients is getting rid of distractions and then trusting having faith that the Harvest is there for you so beautiful week of work but remember you've got lots of support every single one of us is blessed by God and has God's so much support if we will ask for it and more importantly if we will accept that support my prayers are with you I will be live on hey House Radio this week and I'm sending you lots of Angel blessings I'm all casual today because I'm out in the garden so I'm going to pick some kale and have some lunch and I hope the same for you that you will know that you can afford to have organic food we all can we absolutely can ask God for help with our healthful diet and it will happen I promise you please say it with me Aloha Angel blessings have a beautiful week

        "transcript": "[Music] hi guys so as you can see from the title of this video I went to Primark again and I did some shopping and I thought I would stick it in a haul for you guys because Primark huls tend to be quite likeed on YouTube I don't know I love watching Primark HS myself because then it makes me want to go to Primark and it kind of shows you what's in so I went to Primark a couple of days ago and I thought I would show you guys what I got it's not like a massive massive my cool but the first thing I got is this pair of shoes and they're basically just a tan pair of kind of loafers and then they have this like laser cut detail in them which I thought was really nice and these were only \u00a36 I probably should have cut these tags off before I filmed but I thought these were really cute and I thought they'd be really nice for summer just with like casual everyday outfits with like some skinny jeans or with a skirt and yeah I just thought they'd be a really nice casual pair of shoes so they look like this if you can see all the laser C detail and yeah like I said they were only6 so I got these I then got another pair of shoes these ones are quite a bit different but they're still flat these are a pair of black pointed toe pumps and on one side it's kind of uh goes all the way around and then this bit has like a cut out here so it kind of shows the side of your foot and I've been wanting a pair of black plain pointed toe pumps for ages and I saw these and they were only a FIV so I thought I'd get these as well and they have a kind of like really subtle um scaled snake skin kind of effect I'm not too sure if you can actually see um but yeah they have a very very subtle pattern on them but they're basically just plain black pointed toe shoes the next thing I got is pray of pajamas and these are actually super screwed up because I've worn them already but I just could not resist getting these as you can tell from my surroundings I really like pugs my whole duvet set got pugs on it this pillow as much as my duv obviously this is a pillow that I drew and then got printed on red bubbles so that's a little pug and this one which you can't really see that's also a pug so if you can't already tell I'm a bit obsessed with pugs and I saw these pajamas and I just had to get them this is the t-shirt it's just gray and this is absolutely huge by the way they only had medium left but I wasn't just going to get the bottoms and not get the matching top so I got size medium and I think it's kind of oversized anyway so this is like huge on me but it's basically just a gray t-shirt and then it's got a little pug with glasses and then it's got this pink and white bit around the neck and then the bottoms which are my favorite look like this and they're white they've got a little blue kind of bow thing at the front and they just got these little pugs and glasses all over them some of them have pink bow eyeses and some of them have blue bow eyeses and then at the bottom they have this oh what's it called like an elasticated bit at the bottom which kind of goes in and these are so comfortable and yeah I just could not resist getting these pajamas and let me look at my receipt the T-shirt was \u00a34 and the bottoms for \u00a37 so I thought that was a pretty good deal continuing on from the Pug theme I got some of these like footsy socks um and these have the creepiest looking pgs on them I've ever seen there was another pair that came with this but they're in the wash but this is the second pair so it comes with two pairs um and the other pug was actually creepier but this pug looks so creepy I don't know they just look really funny I need some more pairs of these anyway just to we up with my Vans and stuff you can't see them when you're there in your shoes so I just thought i' get the PB ones anyway cuz I thought they were really funny and they were \u00a32 for two pairs so next I got some makeup bits from the PS Love range um I got two lip liners this one which I'm wearing now it's this kind of really pretty it's a kind of like dark mauy color um it's really really pretty and I do actually really like the formula of these so this is the first one I don't think they actually have names oh this one is apparently number nine and then the second one I got is basically just Brown lip liner um and these are both really like Kylie Jenner lip colors um yeah this one's basically just like a straight up brown lip liner and this is number 10 and they were both a pound each so there are the swatches there so here are the swatches um so this one is the brown one and the second one is the ma one that's on my lips right now I then got another pair of these Salt Tree eyelashes because I had a pair of these before and I do actually really like them so I just thought I'd get another pair for a pound I then got some nail files which to be honest I didn't really need these but I just got them because they had flamingos on them and I thought they were really cute so you get four in a packet for \u00a31 which I thought was a really good deal and I'm probably going to be putting one of these or two of these into my 5K giveaway which will be hopefully soon but it will probably be in quite a few months time but yeah I'm going to be putting some of these in there just cuz I thought they were super cute so next I got one of the PS Love baked wet and dry eyeshadows and this was \u00a3 2250 and this is in the shade 14 dark brown um and it's basically just a shimmery kind of baked ey Shadow and I just thought it was a really pretty color it looked in the shop light it looked kind of like a ready brown but now I've taken it home it's more of like a chocolate brown but it's still really really pretty and yeah I do really like this so far it's pretty pigmented so that's what that one looks like on my hand so the final thing I WR in Primark is completely not sumary at all it's one of the oh yeah and I put it back on the hanger so badly it's one of primark's classic Tartan scarves and last year I was looking for one of these for so long in the winter I literally went to so many different Prim marks trying to find them um and so when I saw this one in there even though it's July I thought I just needed to get it now because by the time it gets to Winter like I have no idea why these were already in there they seem to be like getting a few Autumn winter bits already but I saw it and I was like mine I just I just shoved it in my basket and yeah this was \u00a37 and it's one of their huge blanket scarves um which has a few tassels at the bottom it's just Tartan which is I love Tartan stuff and then on the inside it's got hounds tooth which is quite exciting but the thing I have about this scarf is it's so huge and I'm like pretty small well I'm really small I'm 5'2 so this kind of overwhelms me and I have like quite small features and quite like a generally small person and this scarf is literally like absolutely huge so I just don't know how to wear it so if any of you guys have any suggestions how to wear these massive blanket scarves please let me know down below so that is everything that I got in Primark and I hope you guys have enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up if you want to chat just leave me a comment and it would also be amazing if you would subscribe if you have enjoyed this video so you can can like see the rest of my videos when I post them so yeah I hope you guys have a good day and I will see you in my next video bye

I mean spots where it's you know that's exactly right and then\non this side you can kind of see where it's starting to shoot up this way you\ncut it right there in front of that that's going to give you for peace if\nyou're desperate you could cut it again here but probably won't leave this piece\nalone and then what do you do with the leaves that look so so when you cut it\nyou leave them on there till new leaves come on nucleus I don't ever take off\nthe leaves I always leave it on the plant will absorb the nutrients and\nthyme is even with the believes looking Krunk on like an Amazon sword where you\nwould want to take off the leaves and new leaves would be coming up exactly\nmyself I've always just left them on there because they're so slow growing\neven a leaf like this is going to do some good on a new visa Commission so\nyeah keep cutting man show a little this all right so we got that on this one\nhere the plant started growing off on its own little angle here so we're going\nto split down here at the base and pull another piece there you want to\nmake sure you're leaving roots on all these pieces if you take a cent that\nmany roots it's going to be a lot harder if you get it going again and then what\ndo you do with the roots bro would you keep them long because I'm a trimmer but\nmyself I like to leave them longer I guess you could trim them but the plants\nalready grown to absorb nutrients I wouldn't really want to take them off of\nthe anubius since they're so slow yeah all right this one here is kind of\ndifficult because it's like a big game SG seeing you know we've actually got\ntwo plants here together I think and for me I just be yanking of the bride's like\nnow I get a razor blade to a right so yeah and there's there's mixed debates\non that some people say like certain plants you want to cut and certain you\nwant to rip this plant here was already two pieces this wasn't even show that\nall right by the way these will be going out and some orders here in a little bit\nso good for you yeah dude we got this show that and then I want to talk\nabsolutely turn that into one two three four yeah alright peace here can still\nbe split in half so that could still be going but I mean you guys get the idea\nthey're coming along I mean that we just you know break that I made it stand so\nthat's how you do a newbie Asst I want to talk about the other species here I\nwant to talk about Kleinert bar swords which by the way is available on\naquaticjungles right now I have a piece of paper somewhere I wrote down with the\nvariety between the two our hotel right there here we go it's a cross had to\nlook it up it's a cross between account of doors Bart the eye and condors\nj\u00f6rgen insists I don't know if I pronounced was right and frankly I don't\ncare but Connor bar sword I like these swords listen folks if\nyou've got a dirted tank like you owe it to yourself to get a big six sword you\nreally do because they're big heavy root feeders love eating all the excess\nnutrients you know are not excess nutrients they're they're big heavy root\nfeeder hence the heavy roots and I've got a\nwhole big thing on roots I'm going to do here in a little bit but on this plant\nas far as dividing I'm actually not going to cut it but I just want to show\nthis would be one that could be cut if you needed to really do it see\nhow it's kind of got and point out kind of what I'm talking about here so where\nwhere would you cut this briar we've got Kyle we're talking about maybe cutting\nit here kind of getting this piece off here exactly I pull the leaves out a\nlittle bit you can kind of see where the plant would match the natural breaks\nthat's what you're looking for and if you don't have it don't do it like it's\nlike we're not I don't want to cut this because I don't want it's not ready yet\nso it's actually connected but somebody's going to get a nice fat sword\nin a couple weeks they can put in a two but that's how you would with breaking\nit up I will set in anubias a a Condor bar sword or any Amazon swords check out\nvideo 3:30 3:30 - I can't talk today 322 I did another species Sunday on a bunch\nof swords a while back I like the Conor barb sword available on aquaticjungles\nexcited about it have these real red leaves in the middle and these will\nactually once they get into a good substrate become the main center all the\nleaves to come out and then once they get older they have like they keep the\ngreen on the ends you got any thoughts on the carnivore sure to keep them herd\nout of it a real big one for awhile didn't he is that an ocelot they get\nbigger the guys along yeah so person that's what we're doing and oh by the\nway we're getting the 125 roll in here we got all these plants over here we got\nsome onions in the face right here onions on aquaticjungles now I'm rocking\nthis kind of jungle Val I'm real pumped about it so I'm just having a real good\ntime I wish the temperature would either stay hot or stakeholders I'm like back\nand forth being sick so that's what's up people having a lot of fun cut up your\nanubias cut up your kind of doors if you can later"

City at St Mary's and tomorrow evening's tight at anfield against [Music] Liverpool one player who had a huge influence in that win against the canaries was versatile 18-year-old Jake Flanigan he's made the transition between Center Midfield and right back this season and could return to the middle of the pitch against the Reds on Thursday he made his under 21 debut in this fixture last season and is relishing the chance of playing at a stadium steeped in history like it's a great Stadium obviously playing against Liverpool there be fantastic experience like not everyone can say that they've played at anfield so yeah I'm definitely looking forward to it and I'm sure all the boys are looking forward to playing there as well good memories for yourself last season a 43 win at the Academy as well yeah definitely that was my debut for the under 21 so to get thrown and playing 90 minutes and get a 4-3 win against Liverpool on TV as well it was a great start to the season for me and yeah like I said it's a good experience will that be something you'll draw Confidence from you know good experiences like there yeah definitely all the boys will just like a sort of breathing a confidence playing at our fun stuff everyone will be excited to place and show what they can do about after your performance against n how about you been RAR to go again you know bet the break's been quite long isn't it that two weeks yeah unfortunately like last season there's a bit of breaks between games so I think everyone's just ready to just get back playing you know start playing in the league again but me personally I'm very excited to play at anfield you've had a couple of games at right back recently how have you found there yeah I think I've just grown to it and took to it naturally like sort of more suited for me I'm like like defending and sort of getting in stuck in and stuff so yeah I've enjoyed it do you feel like you know that's more of a useful like factor to your game you know if you can play more than one position do you feel like you're more useful to the team for Martin yeah definitely it's always good to be versatile like if there' be more options for me in the first team if I'm if I'm ever needed but yeah being able to play more positions I find is very helpful how would you feel about slotting back into that Center in position though you know really trying and dominate against Liverpool once again yeah I'll be looking forward like as my main position so hopefully I I'm comfortable in there again but no I do look forward to getting back in there sort of getting more involvement within the game Thursday's fixture represents a chance for Saints to Leap Frog Liverpool in the Barkley's under 21 Premier League table they currently Trail the Red Zone goal difference but Liverpool do have a game in hand last season Saints edged a seven goal friller at Kirby Academy a first half brace from Omar row and Jake Sinclair strike saw the score fre all at half time Sinclair's second was the only goal in the second half to see Southampton take all three points and Hunter is confident the players can repeat that for at anfield road so Martin anfield on Thursday a new but exciting experience for all the players yes I mean it's one of the uh shrines in football to play to anfield so everybody's looking forward to the game and uh if it's anything like the training this morning they'll uh they'll be okay you say it's a shrine of football we played at a couple of stadiums recently is it something a bit different you know maybe from the white heart Lane trip and the Upton Park trip it is I mean obviously the history anfield and and the actual location of the ground and how tight the crowd is to the pitch gives it a real uh Buzz a real good atmosphere you had quite a strong Squad last time when it came to the game at St Murray's against Norwich how are you looking Personnel wise this time are you expecting to be a little bit younger this time well we'll uh we'll speak further you know later today about that so we'll see what players are available and then we'll uh we'll do our match preparation tomorrow and then travel uh tomorrow afternoon up up up to Liverpool do a a light training session on uh Thursday morning and and then uh you know prepare for the game you've had a long time to wait since that game for this to come rounds I bet there's been a lot of preparation you know have you really built up on that momentum game from that Nar game well there is I mean this morning we've had uh quite a few of the under 21's training the first years have trained this morning because the second years have got their uh their PFA they're doing the level two coaching so that's uh they were in the classroom this morning so it's a good chance to look at the Improvement that the first years are making with the with the likes of macka and uh and and the other um under 21 boys it's also very pleasing to see Bevis back in full-time training and and gapy so that strengthens us how are B and Dom doing so far yes I mean they they've had a bit of time uh behind Clos doors in a game and uh they're now training you know regularly W with the squad so Fitness is is not an issue match Fitness is obviously uh going to be the thing that they LA but we'll we'll wean them back into the the uh the team will that start on Thursday do you believe with either of them they'll be up there uh both will be within the squad on Thursday but we'll have to see about the starting 11 later today and will you look to reshuffle the side in any way shape or form I mean for example you had Flanigan at right back for nor game again that'll be dependent on on players that are available but he's he's done particularly well at right back we know he can play in Midfield but we want to give him more more strengths to his bow obviously if he can play in two positions it's uh it gives you a better chance of being picked"

and new ones row I think it's the Gold Coast Hawks and the poorly named Murray steamers on the frame seriously there's one mascot you don't want to get down with beyond that it's all systems go last year season ended in a kind of sort of controversial manner there was some controversy I don't want to draw on it there isn't a sadist all investigation going on and there wasn't bubbling at the after-party but this is a great sporting encounter and you want to get involved look out for Jack Attack so Jack Attack it's at your local club it's the same form of the game they're playing up at Club pine rivers which is ground zero for the grouse sporting encounter I've never seen it any chance that that that will famous stand up and Peter Hillier could get a job up there you'll be like a war esau figure up could you get coming off a long run I'll leave my phone at home is that it's so slow and calm does it ruin it we've got the speed it doesn't because there's room for everything this is like the 2020 version of the game but still my favorite thing is going to a bowling club which to me is like an outdoor cathedral a great little green oasis in a desolate urban experience and as you point out 1972 prices it is great I mean obviously everyone's aware of how much of a fan you are obviously through things like cracker jacka they're both members of the same balls club I haven't always been in the country carrying down there and a great bunch in there and they're actually for something that like you think is is mainly for all the people they're so welcoming of new people coming in they really do get down there for some barefoot bowls on a Sunday it's just a great family experience these things they're a little epicenters of the community and they take all comers you'll be surprised I love it along by the hymns nights and the you know because there's a lot of them happen at balls clubs by the end of it they'd be like alright girls and now Westco burger ball stop my convenient kit legends down there and we had their wakes at the bowls club and we ended the night but it's barefoot bowling and we doesn't point where we forgot what were there to be honestly one of my favorite clubs is Clovelly in sydney because it has the bowling club and then it's right on the cliffs and it's beautiful that immediately next door is a graveyard it's kind of appropriate it's like that like a Hall of Fame football I'm like it opens on a balmy brain if I turn up I generally get well received it as anyone would if you travel anywhere go to country Victoria curb call the bowling club just get out go and have a look and you'll have it you'll be surprised at what you learn about your own country and your culture and I'm always fascinated by what people have looked on your bowl you can have a little symbol of something do you have anything personalised skull-and-crossbones no like me and I'm an old traditional so I go for the colour bowls which seem to reign supreme today and I'd like to keep chatting to you we've got 10 seconds left so I just want to be able thank you can we"

        "transcript": "hi everyone uh today what I'm going to talk about is how to type in Babi so how to get it basically up and running on your computer and then uh like what the actual keyboard layout is like and uh yeah just getting you up and running with that so that you can actually use the real G Moi alphabet instead of typing in English all right so here we go uh you go down to start menu open up control panel you go down to uh Regional language settings there now I'm using Windows uh Windows Vista here but Windows 7 is similar so here you see this keyboards and you open here are all the keyboards that I currently have installed so you can see English Hindi uru Punjabi click on that button and look you've got all these languages ready to be basically enabled because uh Windows Vista Windows 7 Haven come with all these if you've got Windows XP you may need to have your windows disc ready to install them you see you just check the boxes like I have checked and that actually uh installs the keyboard itself here are the key commands for switching between what uh you're using to type so you press alt shift and you'll switch from English then to like Punjabi then back to English if you press alt shift again it's really simple really uh easy process so let me show you an example here yo there you go yo again and there U here here Babi so yeah thanks it's it's really easy uh really easy to figure out here but actually typing in bab you may find a bit more difficult so here is the actual layout uh I'll give you the link here you can click on to get to this website now you see what you have is the basic Keys here right when you're holding shift and when you're holding Control Alt I just think you have to hold alt that's all I I do and uh so from that point you know here's all the basic thing as I said when you're not pressing anything you've got all these vowel Matra signs which you know if you can read Hindi or Panjabi you add on to the consonants to uh give a different vowel sound uh it's pretty logical the layout here is according to the Indian style here's the uh actual full vowel signs down here and some alternate characters uh everything here's laid out according to the corresponding kind of sounds in the Punjabi alphabet okay not English down here you've got some of these dotted signs these are these perso Arabic sounds like these things but you don't actually have to use these Keys uh you can use another sign which actually just adds a DOT onto any letter this one here so you don't actually need to use these uh as custom characters or is necessary for alt that's you're going to have to use a lot of for so there you go I mean the one problem is punctuation you don't have all the punctuation keys so let's like type a question here right so like you know K right you want to add a question mark you got to press alt shift and switch back to English because look do Punjabi it's not a question mark so there you go that's what you got to do all right now you may be wondering how you can learn the layout and become a quick typer um if you don't have keyboard stickers well I showed you that uh layout and you got the link for that so you can take a look at that at first forgetting fast it's all about practice that's really it um you just you know sit back turn on some music and uh get some sample sentences and type them out for 15 minutes you know twice a day and within three four days you'll be typing I mean not extremely quickly but you know you'll get a natural instinct for where the keys are so now you uh you know how to type my next video is going to be about learning to read and write for anyone who doesn't know G Moki I'll talk a bit about shami which is basically Babi written uh with the Arabic type script but it's going to be focused on goodi so that's what most of you guys want to learn I think so that's what we'll focus on uh I'll give some tips and all that that were useful for me next I'm going to talk about how I learned Punjabi like my own experiences in Punjab my own history how I got to where I am now uh and the third video there pronunciation tips my pronunciation is not not perfect uh no one can get a native accent in a foreign language uh well some can but that's actually like a developmental Talent you your brain's not supposed to work that way after you're a child but some people are lucky uh but I'll give you like tips for an English speaker because there's a lot you can learn just by thinking about how your tongue is moving in your mouth so basically yeah yeah you should be thinking about your tongue it's important and I'll talk all about that so all right I'll upload my next video in a few days see you guys soon"

        "transcript": "hey was that a folks text we're not one here and I'm going to go ahead and complete this Browns playoff collection this is my first collection completed I wasn't to the Panther one but you guys already know that one's kind of impossible right now so much luck has to go my weight I'm not about to make that happen so I decide to go into this Browns collection which might be the easiest one to do if you guys are looking for a collection do this one might be easy if you have this 94 overall Joe Hayden with his own defense medical chemistry the guys are in luck going for 50 case if you guys want 50k go ahead and sell it but as of now I'm a I'm gonna make so much going on this collection it's not even funny like it is one of the best collections for money I did so part in this game right this is Ron 50k per already had it so I'm cool on that his Buster scrying was like like 2000 coins this guy was around 8,000 this guy was pretty cheap as well so really doing guys weren't for a lot was is Joshua Gordy and he was around 10k this where's the Phil Taylor was around 5000 coins you have to loop around 15k some guys here going for like seven thousand coins out of this guy but other than that like I spent about what is it let's say about sixty seventy Canada's collection that's not you Bennett may get 25,000 points back and right now the Josh Gord is going for right around one hundred ninety thousand coins so this is gonna be great profit but this collection is pretty nice as well considering that I don't really have to or you don't have to put any of the base gold cards from basically back in that and first came out all these car to row to the playoff content so unlike the Cowboys unlike the other cards in this game Cowboys liens that's the only collection I know as of right now that checked that doesn't not have any of the base gold car that makes it a lot easier on you to get the collection done so you guys want to get this collection done price it out sandwich it'll cost how much corn is going for it might make you some coins so that's pretty much what I want you to tell you right there but here is the Josh Gordon know this guy whoa this guy is stacked purple team MVP 98 overall wide receiver Josh Gordon man 96 speed 96 agility 97 catching 88 awareness good catching in traffic spec catch and release this guy is the best receiver on my team sent his car they're active let's go to compare this guy to Dez Bryant we also got C Smith Jordy Nelson is reliable himself so that guy is really a stat loaded I should keep I should keep him but I'm not going to because why why hey why are you keeping right now settle miles phrases hot bottom back once prices low so go ahead and shake this guy real quick Josh and Gordon right I gotta get that guy's car that guy's is this amazing it's not that different from his 97 fantasy cards if you guys happen to have a car do not go ahead and react negativity negativity negatively City we won't coming out of Coulson stand up with one speed boost here and one drink there but then that is pretty much identical that speed wise he's pretty much on par with Dez Bryant or Nothing Stewart you still heard one else on the see now he's cool now our joy Nelson come up a compared to getting bitter comparison by the same height not the same speed six foot three and ninety six feet as a hard combination if I write they're good strength can break those tackles good agility gonna keep going good acceleration that he said it's top speed fairly quickly high awareness he also has himself in 93 loosen it that's pretty nice for a big tall physical wire receiver going keep going 82 stiff arm but the best on 10x is Steve Smith get spin move good carry I'm sorry terrible carry I'm catching Wow 78 carries to leave he might fumble the ball get dead okay yeah that's my kit so 60 carry a dead shouldn't be going wow that's awful right there great spec catch great release 95 jumping so six foot 395 jumping good combination right there can catch the fade route that's cullenburger would say wouldn't keep going as a 40 taco that should be higher Brandon wins no more throwing throwing interceptions so that should be a lot higher than a 40 around like a 75 keep going with housing pass blocking pretty pretty bad like really good run blocker looks like for the high 50 stats there and he has a really slow injury but other than that the card to really stack so I like this Josh Gordon I'm obviously not gonna keep it because the coins is calling me right now with this guy's car there's barely stacks like I say if you guys want to do a collection and you like in Nancy you know which collection start with if you have a lot of the Browns players and you reserve silver gold you can either sell them off or do the collection like I said I'm gonna make at least 200,000 coins off this collection which is really nice so that is pretty much the video folks thank you guys for watching hope you enjoyed the Browns collection please in the picture without low but it's Josh Court is a beast please"

great damage yes she does if you get her into a middle of a mob and your and teammates help so glad everyone's safe yeah problem she can pretty much decimated an entire especially since I haven't really skill boosted it at all she was a hunter close yeah she's a hunter oh let me skill boost that thing I like that come it's a great skill for now it's only three wow almost maxed it out already H yeah I already maxed out a sted slash which one's that uh oh burning finger yeah I tried to Juke it well you did a very poor job at it we must make the most you don't Juke it by running into it Dam it yeah no offense but your old uh Edge kind of hurt more damn it yeah her thing is kind of random very very random well your damage is pretty not impressive right now as it is so well his his added didn't really put much in Blade and that doesn't skill that well it's great for setting up a skill chain combo because has a multi head huh multi- hit yeah it's great when you uh boost it but okay run around other way running around at this going to say go through that other part where there I know I tried to be the smart though how is that being the smart must make the lingly responsible oh crap yay a you freaking jert face ruin my combo oh I think you're getting hit when your com oh come on really me out of the corner how are you getting pinned down by two guys with an entire team there myti

weather now see that's a pretty good question right there you know it really depends on how bad the weather is maybe it's just like if you made a couple bad choices you know a little misguided wet or whatever then i just said like a body in there like black cloud or something like that you're the little fresh one in the back of the precipitation and say hey buddy straighten up you know why is it

know you're gonna end up doing five years of state or something like that if it's real bad weather you know like a hurricane or something like that would be a real thorough hurricane i mean that thing's not stopping until like every trailer is down you know what i'm saying for that type of thing but you gotta put together some guys and go in there you know surround them a little bit some guys are going to work on a body he says one guy in the middle gal just flip an eye out you know if there's no eye of the storm they can't see what it's doing and they need to push it out in the ocean you know watch it just spit itself out like a little hyperactive kill that's where you handle something like that though sometimes you're going to rephrase it down though something it's like whoa like you know like you remember tony killaroni from back in the neighborhood you know that kid was just like all off it's something like that you know damn that's a pure evil winner i mean there's nothing that's right about that you know like a scissors which is like a blizzard except instead of snow you got possessed sizzles whipping around i mean that's the type of thing that even i'm like okay you know what that's a little bit too much for me when you got big league bad weather you gotta call in the big gun of course i'm talking about the wind he's a buddy of mine so i can say that not the brightest car in the tool ship we're a good guy don't get me wrong real good guy yeah anyway you gotta get to win the game hey wait you know why hey you know what the storm is just you know with the

        "transcript": "I'm Oscar and I'm here today to explain you how we make port wine as you know port wine is only made in the douro valley in porto this is our winery these are some of our vineyards and all the grapes we grow in our vineyards come to our winery just right in front of me so we are in November but I I decided to I try to find some some bunches than were left in the vines to explain you all are we make port this pretty simple we have three kinds of port white port which is made with white grapes and rosy and red port which is made with red grapes like this the red port can be divided in two types in ruby port which is bottle age and the tawny port which is barrel aged so the difference between port wine and the regular wine is in the fermentation for port we stop the fermentation when it has run at the mill so we had a kind of a brandy which is it which we have here 77% alcohol and adding this brandy the East will die so I will try to explain a little bit how we can make it in general the fermentation can last for three four days depending on the temperatures we have we we ferment the the Joyce in contact with the skin to get more structure so we almost always we take the berries out of the out of the bunch so we disclaim it but today it's not not very easy to do it so let's put all the bunch of grapes here then it will crush it so let's try to crush it not easy so this was this is what our crushing machine that just crushed the berry we crush it you can see then we already have a little bit of color pretty light yet at scrunching this actually then the juice is pretty cold today this morning we had zero degrees I guess now it's around four or five the daughter is getting schooled and called November and so I'm pressing the berries we already have a little bit of juice so Kim's in the fermentation tank absolute moral keen more skin good so every hour over two hours with we we pump it over so we take the juice from the bottom we put in the top just keep moving it this is to help us to mix them demamp and also for the east to to go through a similar fermentation in all around all over the tank so after three four or five hours they eat will start eating the sugar they will multiply theirselves and will start increasing slowly the alcohol content in the mass and reducing the sugar level and when you get around six seven percent alcohol natural alcohol in the mask we do something like this we have the brand in seventy seven percent alcohol pretty strong we had around 20 percent we put it in give the round 24 a little bit more we want from the east to stop and now we have around 20 percent alcohol in the must and with 20 percent alcohol is cannot survive they stop eating the sugar and all the sugar and is still left in the mask will continue and will agent with the wine so the fermentation is right now stop because of the the alcohol and then we decant this we take the juice out of course we put in the barrels and we we will age it for five years or 50 years depends on what what you want to do is wine so this is pretty simple and the big difference is in the the sweetness of the wine port is a sweet wine so to keep this sweetness we have to add a brandy around 20% to stop the fermentation we kill the east and we have port wine mate thank you very much if you have any questions just email me Oscar at cavero port wine calm hope to see you soon bye"

        "transcript": "sight in the game see the boxing.com live here with Antonio Tarver Antonio I guess the first question I want to ask you is uh is it going to be a little strange get stepping back into the ring and having your colleagues critique you this time I I've done that before with Showtime I mean it won't be strange to me I mean they got a job to do and I'm sure they're going to be consument Pros uh I expect them to uh but you know this is what I do man this is my uh this my passion it's my love and I got a one big enormous dream left in this final chapter of my illustrious career and that's become the oldest man to ever win the heavyweight championship three Division champion I mean what else can you say and so uh we're embarking on a a a hell of a Magic Carpet Ride in the next year and a half is there uh some sort of game plan or blueprint written out on how you plan on overtaking the heavyweight division uh obviously Cunningham is first what would be next and I know Fighters don't think ahead but obviously you know wanting to be the heavyweight champion the oldest heavyweight champion you we have to move quickly well you know I'm going to have to it's going to have to come by process of elimination I'm going to have to eliminate everybody else out there uh the same way I did in the light heavyweight division but you know after Cunningham it can only be either Wilder or klit go but I know they're not going to hand me klco just like that they're GNA make me earn it so I may have to go through uh Deontay Wilder to get that shot and if that's the case so be it man I'm ready for whatever and I'm going to show these people what boxing is all about I'm going show them what the game been missing and I'm going let them know that boxing is about what's up here not your physical physique and how many muscles you got now there's been mention of Wilder possibly fighting Chris arola what do you think of that matchup uh do you think it's too easy for Wilder or you think it's just right to keep him undefeated give you enough time to beat Cunningham and square up in the ring with him I really can't really tell you about what his career in what direction his career is going in all I know he got a belt and with that belt that puts a Mark that that puts a mark on his head so you know I'm coming at that Championship man but everybody know I want greatness you know and that's what I've always been about setting unbelievable goals and unreachable goals for some but uh you know until I defeat Vladimir Klitschko I mean I don't know what else there is to you know to do everything falls short of that he is the L heavyweight champion so um in order for me to be considered the best in the division I have to go through klit go that's the fight I want we come from the same era we come from the same Olympic team there's only three names from that 96 Olympic team that still resonate in in boxing that's Mayweather Tarver and klits go I want that Showdown but you know it'll be too right for them just to hand me klits I never had it that easy so I'm going to have to beat everybody in my way and right now Wilder is is in the way of klit so I think that'll be my my path to klit now you you keep mentioning Wilder obviously you're not afraid of the challenge but how do you match up with a guy with so much power man everybody I face has power but power is only uh only works is when you land the power I fought a lot of guys with power a lot of guys said they was going to come knock me out I mean but you can't hit what you can't see and and I'm never I'm not afraid of no man I know I believe in my ability I believe in my skills and I believe in God's promise and it's bigger than just boxing man that's what people don't understand I'm on a mission I'm on a a destiny trip they're just in the way I'm coming through though and they ain't going to be able to stop it do you think you can do it again we are always going to remember you for what you did to Roy Jones Jr a legend a lot of people's hero do you think you can do the same thing to Vladimir Klitschko or even Deontay Wilder I just told you I would I mean you wasn't listening that's the problem people hear me but they never listen they take me for granted I they taken me for granted my whole career five times I defied the odds six times going to be a charm now you've obviously passed down the jeans uh the boxing uh Heritage to your son uh what are you expecting from your son on his uh upcoming fight here on this ESPN debut of PBC I expect great things from Junior you know I mean because he put in the work I can't fight for him but it's in him if I've ever seen it before if I've ever sat ringside and seen anybody before I'm telling you it's in him it's a blessing man I can't I can't understand why I get these blessings I can't understand it but I'm not going to question God I'm not going to question it I'm going walk to my destiny and he's going to walk to his my career may be over in two years but his career is just going to be starting so the name Tarver is going to ring loud and clear in boxing for years to come years to come well thank you very much champ"

        "transcript": "side number two kicking off right now Envy off the split is going to send nameless to capture their home flag everyone else searching forward and let's see what Rambo's up to here coming from the white side he's going to go straight for a off the start so we asked what is his strategy going to be actually is not going to go for that flag tries to come on the flank nameless gets one Rambo gets the other can they get b control Rambo Falls but study and MC are still up that was a big defensive kill there from Rambo he was definitely going to go for that a push decided to back off and try and cover that ref flag you recognized would have got immediate control of it he's still neutral for now D nice pick from him he's going to try and jump on that flag puts the tropy system down three here they got this yeah this is a cap 100% nicely played by SB and now every single second they have this two to one cap Advantage they are building upon that lead that they had in that first side apy now on your screen and we're going to bring up Oracle mode for you Saints feeling the pressure knows he's the last man standing needs to get some big kills there's some help as dto and Saints are going to combine for two sensor and apathy now now need to keep Envy off that flag apathy is going to make sure that happens sensor with another assist and sensor now going for that sneaky roll needs to win this oneon-one and he does yeah really big pick up there as he's pushed through towards Envy's base and I really like this play you know he's going to try and just get a couple of kills off spawn as those eny plays are rotating towards B hasn't seen anyone just yet but now potentially could actually go for that neutralize on C you can see there on your mini map he's completely by himself at C his teammates need to hold on to that b flag there MV decided to drop back One play actually now they're kind of just leading him to cap that flag and that's a risky strategy cuz right now M they're going to get trip capped wow so sensor will force the trip cap apathy getting taken off spawn Saints spawning all the way back in the left corner and B uncontested EnV will secure a now they will be slow to the middle of the map Saints should have the advantage here Saints picks up one he knows the second's going to be around there he sees him juk back in baby gets the jump kill on nameless nicely done shutting the door as well but a couple of mvy players now have started to rotate towards a that's probably going to be Rambo Y no surprises there to see him but he has a gun fight that he needs to win the NAD are going to fly and this is going to be it can he pick it up yes he can and that's going to give mvy just a little bit of momentum now little bit of Hope as he does capture that flag another gunfight any second to his left but Saints comes out strong and he should be able to cap that flag right back and they look like they're pushing for the a flag again or C flag again excuse me that's going to be sensor I believe will he be able to get it for a second time two players helping him they're just going to flip sides of the map here they are going to keep b control let sensor capture C and now it is going to continue to be a two to one flag situation Envy running out of time now looking at the clock there's just about 130 seconds left to play here in Domination Envy down big 17 points from the first round and about 20 here in the second yeah we need to see Envy really now push for that trip cap but it's going to be very difficult to get a trip cap when you're getting out Slade you know Saints to be fair to 10 six he's been getting some crucial kills sensor and do as well they've been picking up those important kills on those flags and they've really neutralized Rambo again and you know it is that time where if you Rambo you have to try and do something a little bit different in this last two minutes nameless getting picked off as well he was the star Slayer in the first half now it's MC trying to go big at 12 and S but no one supporting him study 6 and 8 6 and 8 for nameless despite the three caps on the other side Saints has been the lead Slayer with dto backing him up in that kill column but a a very uh kind of slow game here not as many kills as we've seen in some of the other series as these players are being a bit more methodical and sneaky as they're trying to move around the map yeah you can see now the way the SP have really realized that this is their game to lose and as we approach the last minute they know they have such a big lead at this point that they can just do that overextend strategy just put pressure on the enemy's home flag sensor was he able to neutralize it yes he was so at this point every second counts it oh and it looks like you're going to have another player back at the base it's Saints trying to keep a contested meanwhile censor is going to make sure C is back in their control Envy does have the two cap here and they brought it within 7 seconds in the second round but running out of time the final 45 seconds left on the clock Andy needs the three cap now yeah they need to push and that's exactly what they're going for you can see on the top left of your screen but sense is going to try and counter that with a very intelligent push towards a and there's only going to be one mvy player there to try and defend it R's going to get shut down so that that is going to be mathematically imp possible I believe in just a second as those flags are held a still neutral and that's going to be FB taking up that first map big kills by Saints on the defensive end cleaning up study and then Rambo who are trying to overextend Saints is going to finish this one at above 15 kills looking for number 16 and 17 there's one there's two can't get it his teammate though sensor will clean it right up actually that was dto in the kill feed but we're going to have sensor jump on B just to finish the objective strong with apathy nice game from strictly business they are continuing on their perfect streak here at fale University the US championships they are now seven and oh yeah they are just playing very very well and you have to give mvy a little bit of props there you know they started a little bit of a comeback and but sadly it was just too much too late I guess you could say you know they they did leave it a little bit late for that overextend pushing for the trip cap and then Rambo was unfortunate enough he didn't actually pick up The Kill to enable him to actually go for it but you know this Strictly Business lineup do not look like you can mess with him right now they are very good can I say something brutally honest right now I guess when sensor and This Crew got picked up by an organization known as strictly business I was shocked I was like why is an organization going after this team then come umg Philly these guys break into the top five looked excellent there on the main stage and now they're proving that the founders of SB made a wise decision they are putting on a show this is a new Squad a team to look out for at the World Championships they're looking to keep up this momentum game two snd is coming up after this"

        "transcript": "what's your take on this delay of the Galaxy S4 I mean if I remember correctly there were delays when the iPhone 5 came out as well and if in fact it is a delay of only a couple of weeks or a few weeks it's really trivial and insignificant in the grand scheme of things Samsung is well ahead of any Peak sales seasons and so I think that as long as it does come out and all indications from the supplier channel is that it's will I I haven't heard anything uh overly ominous in terms of it being delayed indefinitely and so I do think it comes it's well ahead of the iPhone 5S or whatever the next version iPhone is and I think that does give Samsung the near-term end and yeah what about the reviews a phone with no soul that's harsh so I think that might be a bit extreme it's a beautiful piece of Hardware it does put the limits on display technology imaging technology it's got faster internal Hardware it's got the Qualcomm Snapdragon CP in it Qualcomm just reported a favorable number today and so I think that it is a move forward in smartphone technology I think it still is a revolution uary category maybe this is just an evolutionary phone within that we do see that so either way Samsung is giving Apple a run for its money I know you've been pouring through Apple's numbers from yesterday what's your biggest takeaway what do you think is the most important thing that we should be paying attention to from Apple's last quarter I really think it's execution and execution relative to the competition and so they've got two problems one is they're up against lower margin and more Innovative Android competition and the other fact is they've moved away from Samsung as a lowcost component supplier so they're getting squeezed on both ends higher component costs and lower cost competition that's the biggest problem for them and they need to turn that around with their own Innovation and maybe with new product or Market categories so let's talk about these potential new categories Tim Cook pretty much shot down the idea that they might come out with a bigger iPhone a 5 in iPhone saying they weren't willing to make the sort of compromises that their competitors have made in terms of resolution and power consumption is is that a mistake we've heard Apple make comments about smaller screen size tablets like that in the past and then doing about face actually our own research suggests that Apple very seriously is looking at larger screen phones we know definitively their Engineers are examining it so maybe this is a bit of a head fake from Tim Cook maybe it just means it's not this year but we do think apple is considering it has to be the numbers are simply too large in that screen size so what about the new products that are coming this year then he mentioned the fall specifically I've heard a cheaper iPhone could come as early as June at WWDC what's your take on the timing what I believe is an iPhone 5S was originally targeting this summer based on the comments from Tim Cook on the conference call 5S as in cheaper iPhone a nextg iPhone okay with potential now that it's pushing out to the fall and I think that there are iPhone models specifically targeting the opportunity from China Mobile's build out of the tdd LTE network whether that means they're cheaper or a variant of some sort becoming an iPhone Mini I'm not sure but I know they're going after that market and it is a more cons sensitive Market you know it's interesting because I was interviewing Kaiu Lee earlier today we're going to show a portion of that interview later in this show but he he used to be the head of Google China he worked at Apple in China Microsoft he doesn't think a cheaper iPhone is really the solution for Apple in China because there are just so many lowcost Android competitors how would you respond to that well if apple is doing its homework and I'm sure they are they will come to that determination on their own and that's why I say what I do know is they're going after technology that can capitalize on the tdd LTE 4G network there in China whether it ends up being a cheaper phone or a better phone or again a larger screen size phone because I do believe they are looking at that category that could be the answer for them so what about a smartwatch what about a TV when are these things going to happen he said fall are we going to see these things this year well I don't know if those elements that you're mentioning are that transformative there's a bigger picture here keeping in mind that iTunes a software move is what really launched this story almost a decade ago now and so does it come from some new software approach some new approach to the TV because Apple TV is happening in the background already maybe we get a TV but we already have Apple TV set toop boxes we have the content going out to its devices so these things are happening in the background I'd like to see something bigger than simply a new hardware variant on something that's already doing so maybe it's something like software services which you know other analysts have said actually Apple could vastly improve on exactly the execution here recently has not been great they stumbled with maps Siri was a little bit overhyped when it came out icloud's been having issues iclouds has not revolutionized the cloud infrastructure space so there's a lot of progress they can make just on some of those initiatives that they've already gotten started and then you'd like to think that Apple still has it within itself to dream up something we haven't thought of but there are other things going on for apple as well it's a vertically integrated story some of its competition like Samsung is capitalizing on using chips like Qualcomm that just reported and that's allowing them to get to Market faster them so maybe even Apple needs to change its business model and business thinking a little bit"

        "transcript": "[Music] in my first pre-road trip inspection video I went through the procedure of checking everything over in your engine compartment to prevent any problems when you're on a long trip and if you recall I paid particular attention to those items which could result in loss of engine fluid particularly coolant and engine oil and if you recall I I quickly mentioned about the radiator neck but I but this is so important I thought it would be good to come back to this subject and actually remove the upper hose so you can see what you should be inspecting when you're checking this so we're going to do that now and to begin with I'm going to go ahead and get a drip pan and drain about a gallon of coolant out of the radiator almost all Mercedes with plastic tank radiators have a drain plug under the car that allow you to drain the coolant on this car it's located on the left side I'm going to go ahead and get a drip pan handy loosen up this plastic plug and let the coolant drain and you note here it's coming out pretty slowly I can go ahead and loosen up the the coolant reservoir tank to speed draining now I can loosen up this upper clamp and let you take a close look at this plastic radiator neck and just loosen the clamp enough to pull the hose straight back oh man look oh man can you you believe this look at that the radiator neck is broken completely broken off I wonder if this owner has any idea they just dodged a bullet take a close look inside here it actually looks like the plastic has rotted out and you can see almost half of the neck has broken cleanly broken off here this is something I've been warning about on my website for years and it never ceases to amaze me that I continually see this happen on these older Mercedes now we'll switch over to the radiator itself and you can see how it broke off the radiator tank along with installing a metal insert in the neck I've also been recommending that people use the wider us style hose clamps I believe in this case it was the wide hose clamp that was the only thing holding this hose onto the broken neck and I mentioned dodging a bullet well let me tell you if you're driving down the freeway and this neck comes off off you've probably got 5 to 8 minutes before this engine will overheat to the point where it can destroy it and unless you're watching your temper temperature gauges all the time which most of us don't this can be a big problem and often leads to catastrophic engine failure what's the solution let me explain the old be radiators are the most prone to failure I think by the mid to late 80s they started figuring out this was a problem and some of these radiators even came from the factory with a metal insert installed some of the newer aftermarket radiators that we sell such as the Nissan's radiators they have a fiber reinforcement embedded in the plastic to prevent this from happening now if you do have an older radiator and it's not broken yet you can go ahead and install the metal insert we have a kit on our website which has the piece you need in the right size along with the correct epoxy to reinforce this neck before breaks if it breaks forget it do not try to repair it if it's already broken in this case I happen to have a used Radiator on hand and I've gone ahead and installed our kit because I don't want this to happen again to this owner this type of failure is caused by a number of things one I believe uh the use of the wrong type of coolant or lack of engine coolant will fatigue the plastic you have the vibration from the diesel engine which accelerates the problem and then the narrow hose clamps that come from the factory tend to put the load right on this part of the neck by installing this metal insert it spreads the load out and by using the wider hose clamp it even expands the load further so even if the if the plastic does crack you have this reinforcement in place which will prevent it from separating while you're driving I'm going to go ahead and notify the owner what I found here but I have a hunch they probably won't even fully comprehend the type of dis disaster they just kind of miraculously avoided by bringing this car in here to the shop I hope you learn something here if you have not already inspected and reinforced your old plastic radiator neck I highly recommend it that you do it now because let me tell you if you lose your coolant you will indeed lose your cool [Music]"

        "transcript": "what's going on YouTube this is the game 360 K man K man K theater mode got to get these games out the uh computer my laptop is filled with so many game plays from like level this is like level 32 35 some [\u00a0__\u00a0] like that I haven't even prestige in this this video gaml but I'm like Prestige 3 uh level 30 something some [\u00a0__\u00a0] like that but I got to get all these game plays out of here man I gota like just do the comment Aries or just simply upload game plays but I know you guys like commentary so I'm at to find the time of day out of my life and just do these videos stop being lazy what's going on YouTube uh hope you guys have had a Happy Thanksgiving you know I've been on Worldstar hip-hop a lot and I seen a lot of [\u00a0__\u00a0] happening but today is no time for stories today I'm going to show you guys the way to Greatness to way to have a high score per minute uh give you some tips gave you some tricks my own sleeve uh how to have a good kill death ratio a good win loss ratio out of the two that you want also a score per minute so actually it's out of the three you want well actually it's not a tips and the tricks video but it's more like a a lesson that I've learned from myself so I can only pass down I can only pass down you uh you you grunts these lessons that I went through in the past up to now even up to now CU sometimes I do get [\u00a0__\u00a0] on I I'll admit you know I might be the game 360 yes but I'm also human human beings make mistakes sometimes I do get [\u00a0__\u00a0] on I'm probably one of the first YouTubers to admit that I'm not always perfect I do lose games you check my stats but at the very beginning of Black Ops 2 beginning of my career uh [\u00a0__\u00a0] uh I was struggling I know my kill death ratio was below uh Point uh one was below one my win loss ratio was like a 50 and I somehow done regained my my strengths I started raping kids taking everybody sneakers and I had my own Foot Locker but now it's starting to get back to that feeling that I'm playing like asses but today it feels like you know I'm getting back in it so right so right now it's a little bit of on and off what I have noticed about the game is man look this big lag conversation also so I I'll think of that also with the time the time period I'm playing usually in the mornings through the mornings or the afternoons that's where you get the easy lobbies you get the uh low level people I don't go Lobby hunting or anything if I stay in one lobby if I get in one lobby I'll stay in there unless I get forced backed out lag conversation lag whatever so you'll want to play around like in the morning time through the afternoon it's your easy lobbies now uh night time everyone gets out of school where uh grown men stop getting high and you know skipping out work calling out work at the end of the night that's where you getting the try hard lobbies what I try to do I just equip a Sil there I'm not playing with a full party out of equ silen cuz one too many try hards they start camping more camping more camping the most camping you ever go seen out of anything equip the silencing on since there's a lag conversation the bullets won't hit y y whatever Rock the low kill streaks when I first started playing I used low kill streaks first I couldn't get dogs I couldn't get the veto warship couldn't get the warhog couldn't get I couldn't get orbital so actually I I first started off as the uh start UAV hell storm missile and I start off a lightning strike the low the low kill streaks especially in objective game modes like domination I play a lot of domination the sentry gun and the lightning strike works most effectively out of everything you can even Beast like higher up players higher up lobbies uh parties all that stuff you know if you use a lightning strike it it might carry on to your next kill streak so you have lightning strike s gun use a lightning strike you'll kill like four or five people and that most likely get S gun right off the bat you probably get like one or two kills so you going have probably work for that UAV so right now I'm using uh actually right currently I'm the level like a level three Prestige player so I'm using to uh unlock a lot of things unlock the Swarm so I use a swarm now but sometimes I do go back and forth so I use the orbital cuz I can get the kill streaks now so you play with low kill play with low low kill streaks first get used to it get used to how the game plays take your time to things it's not the game for you to rush in like I said before it's a lag comp so you can't really rush in how you really want to rush in use the weapons that you're most comfortable in me I thought I would use the assault rifles because Black Ops 1 the assault rifles were more were more balanced than the other weapons but this one I had to use the SMGs the submachine guns gets me moving I like to move fast Plus most of them are pretty damn good in this game all I do is all I do is add a weapon attachments of FMJ UAV weapon attachments some people most people use the uh the target finder sit back we use Target finder cuz it works so well works so effectively and a lot of people don't use cold blooded me so you can use Target finder I use FMJ the most cuz I like I like my I like my bullets that have high damage going shooting through walls so to me actually works out pretty good use the weapons that you most comfortable with so if you see someone dominating in the game if you check out their weapons or their perks and you might be like you might think to yourself hey I might use those uh perks and attachments and weapon setup because he's using it and he's doing really well with it I'll say that's completely wrong not every YouTuber would tell you to use his well he probably tell he he or she might tell you to use this type of setup because they using it and you might see get good uh you might see them get very good game plays that's not always true so use something you most comfortable in shotguns snipers anything you want to use wherever's getting you the most game plays most successful game plays keep using that you don't always you don't have to change up anything someone someone might be like use something different I will never do that you know so uh so the kill streaks go the start with the low ones first keep working your way up uh the UAV I I was strongly advise UAV first then go with the hell storm missile or your lightning strike those those three kill streaks alone will probably get your ass uh [\u00a0__\u00a0] God damn this game is over with already [\u00a0__\u00a0] I might to make a part two of this video so part two is coming up pretty soon it's your boy e peace"

        "transcript": "yo what is up everybody and welcome back to another NBA 2K14 My Career game as you can see we are up 30-0 on the maveri you see down bear immediately start the game off with a bang but that might be his last slam of the Season who knows it depends on how this game goes because if they lose they're done we just sweep them and as you can see the western conference is upside down as I accidentally take a 3/4 qut shot there that was not good I didn't realize I got the ball and I would just you know spam the x button and that's what happens you take three quarter court shots so not the way you want to start off the game I definitely not start off strong but Kevin lost start no he did not we didn't start off strong at all we were bricking everything but um yeah the western conference is kind of inlux right now because the Warriors are up 20 two1 under the Thunder and then the Rockets are up are down 21 to the nuggets as you see Danny T doing it behind the back pass to Kevin Martin and Devin Harris getting this tough shot to go and you know they were they were bringing their try hard pants out here for the most part in this game they're finishing tough shots I it was frustrating I know game three I definitely did not play good defense this game I I knew I had to step it up and that's was that was my thing I was my Mo I had to step with my defense but you know it's Hall of Fame and sometimes they don't really care what you do look at this Shane Lin contested Shane Lin doesn't care so um we'll just have to combat with offense and here Derek Williams bringing this Hammer there and that pick and roll I'm not sure that s skill actually worse that pick and R Maestro but all lights up so maybe it does have something to do but I know is Derk Williams that was a nice finishing here to beat the buzzer here at the first quarter we give it to Chris Johnson and he gets fouled and goes to the free throw L I think he only made one but it's better than nothing right and here we give it to Cory Brewer Cory Brewer gets that to go and you know once again I have pretty much no points I have four points right now I go sit down and it's like I'm not really doing much it's Kevin Love that's basically carrying us right now sure I have the assist number so I'm definitely contributing still it's not like I'm doing anything as I get the steel and the alley you that was intended for Derek Williams but at the same time you know I'm not bringing the scoring at all you see shooting 40% not good right before the end of the second quarter someone misses a putback of BL brand and right and Denny going to throw some mess up to beat the buzzer and it's good Denny Ty holding that form there you see Denny just holding it up like it's good it's good it's good that's probably easily the worst shot I took in the game and it went down it's like okay and when that shot went down atin I was like you know what maybe I got something so I start pulling up three-pointers at r i just like all right time to pull up another three-pointer here this time not a three-pointer maybe step back now I find Pekovic here and Pekovic unfortunately can't get that to go but then he gets the rebound and yep a three-pointer they're not on me and I knocked that down that's one thing I learned especially being a point guard you know I'm not going to get putbacks like offensive rebounds and putbacks right afterwards so we get a nice contester and bring them right so what I do is I immediately run up to the three-point line and usually they can't catch up to me and I get a really good shot and look at this Denny Ty again setting the feet and banging the bucket home that's another three and we're up 19 points the Mavericks can kiss their playoff hopes goodbye as Denny tys is starting to percolate and you know game two I had a little bit of a moment where I start heating up but this time Kaboom Denny Tyson is on fire and there's nothing you can do about it bringing the ball up Court SW to the left three-pointer up three-pointer Down Danny TI cannot be stopped right now six for six as a team in the second half Denny TI oh man just trying to continue the heat check you know eventually one of them wasn't going to go down but you know it was a good streak while I lasted God damn it up to 24 points after having four points right before the end of the second quarter there you see Devon Harris pulling up the three-point there Harris gets a three-pointer of his own after fall asleep a little bit there I mean I have I'm not a perfect Defender and sometimes you know I try to save my energy on defense as we get the block that was definitely not saving energy that was going all out and Lin there try to get the steel missed the steel and then got the block but um yeah sometimes you know I'm not exactly going to you know contest my guy too much because I have to conserve some off um some energy from my offense and I don't want to lose stamina as we hit a little Showtime right there could have easily taken that for a layup but I was like I see you trailing K LOVE I know K LOVE has been scoring you know at will against these Mavericks nobody on that front line can stop them so you know I've reward him and there kov gets the rebound as he does in real life a lot gets a great all pass to Ty who throws the alley to Gerald Henderson and we're just styling on the Mavericks on their home court once again right for the end of the quarter Shane Lin to Brandon right Brandon right though guess that they're going I get blame for it but now 2.6 seconds left we're going to try to beat that buzzer again I run up that he TI pulling up but it can't go down it was just as good or as bad bad I should say as the one to beat the second quarter but just didn't go down this one does though nice inbound pass there a little bit of a you know awkward um thing there a little awkward pass but it's all good Denny Tyson is able to finish you see like I mentioned I have been jacking up the three-pointers but you know it's helping us out since they're going down 6 for9 in the second half there Kevin Love putting up one himself and rattling that one home K love with 23 points and a nice contribution on the boards with six rebounds Monte Ellis putting that three-pointer up and Monte is trying to make sure his team is not going to go home a loser tonight doing all he can but look at Danny Durk may not be on the floor I'll just do my best Durk impersonation though and here Kevin Love in the corner again good you already know K LOVE was just banging on that bucket and you know Monte has not been a key contributor in the series as you know the Mavericks would hope for him to be with Durk out but you know now he's starting to step up but it might be a little bit too late because Denny once again a sharpshooter from downtown that shooting percentage is definitely up and this is easily the best game of Denny Tyson's short playoff career that has only lasted a little under four games and we are a little under now 2 minutes away from taking this first round Series in a sweep but Devin Harris trying to keep hope alive making it a 13-point game now he's pushing the ball up court and I Tred to get the strip there and instead it's a shooting foul okay 2K okay and here getting double team and I kick it out the K LOVE who puts it up but he can't get that shot to go and the Mavs now all of a sudden are only down eight points with a chance to make it six Monte cannot get it to go and that's the thing though the Mavericks needed Monte and Monte is just not that kind of player so you know looks like the Mavericks are about to get swept and we'll definitely take that 30 something seconds left Denny Ty putting up a three-pointer and can you say dagger Denny TI one more time from downtown actually make it one more time right now and that's the last one I promise Denny Ty just spraying the three-pointers on these Maps Monte a half court heave no good doesn't matter and the wolves are going to the second round then he ties Kevin Love and the Gang who are they going to face as you guys are going to see on the brackets we are going to be facing Tony Parker Tim Duncan Greg papovich and the Spurs so hope you guys leave a like on the video If you enjoyed it subscribe for more 2K14 game plays as we go into the second round and I will catch you guys next time for game one"

        "transcript": "you know it's true when when something exceeds your ability to understand how it works it sort of becomes magical and and that's exactly what the iPad is it's hard to see how something so simple so thin and so light could possibly be so capable the iPhone was a revolution and we learned so much from it and developed so many amazing Technologies all the applications the multi-touch user interface it was truly an incredible breakthrough product we wanted to take all of that and apply that to a whole new class of product the iPad is the best web surfing experience the best email experience the best photo and movie watching experience it's going to change the way we do the things we do every day the face of the product is pretty much defined by a single piece piece of multi-touch glass and that's it there's no pointing device there isn't even a single orientation you know there's no up there's no down there's no right or wrong way of holding it I don't have to change myself to fit the product it fits [Music] me we looked at the device and we decided let's redesign it all let's redesign reimagine and rebuild every single app from the ground up specifically for the iPad and and with this large a display you get apps that aren't just a little bit better than their smaller counterparts you get apps that are in order of magnitude more powerful iPad is the best way to browse the web for the same reasons that it just feels right to hold a book or a magazine or a newspaper in your hands as you read them it just feels right to hold the internet in your hands as you surf it and with a screen this large you can you can just see more of the web as you're surfing it and take the New York Times you can see all the top stories they're all just right there if you see something you just reach out and tap it it's completely natural you don't even think about it you just do iPad is a worldclass email client that's incredibly fun but very productive you can go through huge quantities of email really quickly and it's fun because you're doing it all with your hands when you want to compose a new message the keyboard automatically slides up from the bottom and this keyboard is practically the same size as a laptop's keyboard if you want to focus on a single message just rotate to Portrait and everything else gets out of the way so you can concentrate on the content you care about iPad is absolutely the best way to view and share your photos you see every one of your albums there as just a stack of photos and you can just pinch open to peek in a stack or just pinch it open and look at all your photos if you want to share with a friend you can just flip over the iPad and the iPad automatically flips the photo to the correct orientation this is an unbelievable device for a watching video the user interface We Built For This is just fun when you see something you touch it with your finger and it starts playing there's no delay the quality of this video is amazing you can double tap fill the whole screen we also built an incredible Maps application on here it's really fast and we created a calendar application like nothing you've ever seen on a computer before another app we're really excited about is called eye books when you couple books with a high-res color display reading an ebook is just such a pleasure that not only can you read books on it but the UI actually flips over to reveal a bookstore behind it and with a tap of your finger you can purchase and download a book and immediately start reading it so now we have three phenomenal stores on the iPad the iTunes Store the app store and now the iBook store we built the iPad to run virtually every one of the more than 140,000 apps available on the App Store as well as the ones you've already downloaded onto your iPhone so the apps you use every day and all the games you love playing will run on your iPad right out of the box plus with the release of the iPad SDK developers will be building apps specifically for the iPad so there's going to going to be a whole new Gold Rush for app [Music] developers the iPad is the most advanced piece of technology that I've ever worked on at Apple the innovation in the product really starts with multi-touch itself this multi-touch is the largest that we've ever built in a product and it's on multi-touch of this size that you really feel the power and performance that multi-touch can offer by putting well over a th000 sensors in this multi-touch design the level of multi-touch accuracy that the customer will experience is unprecedented when you take the product out of the box and hit the power button the display immediately comes to life and I think our customers experience with that will be wow this is a really vibrant display the back lighting system is LED and led is what gives you the crispness and color quality in the display itself beyond that we use IPS technology IPS is a premium display technology that gives you not only a great experience looking directly at the device but also off angle when you're sharing the device with someone else the reason why this product responds so well and you really feel the performance of it is because of the custom silicon that we designed for this product that silicon is called A4 and it's really built by our Hardware team in concert with our software team and what that gives you is a level of performance that you can't achieve any other way it also gives you the efficiency to achieve a battery that lasts all day long Apple's the one place that you can really do this we build Battery Technology we build chip technology we build software and we bring all those things together in a way that no one else can do it one of the most important features we designed in the iPad was an affordable price PR usually when you get the brand new latest technology it starts at a high price and over time gets more affordable Works its way down we wanted to do it differently we wanted to take all this advanced technology of hardware and software do everything we could to get it to the hands of as many people as possible right from the start the iPad starts at just $4.99 and that's really exciting the iPad on one hand is clearly way bigger than just a new product this is a new category but yet millions and millions of people are going to be instantly familiar with it they're going to know how to use it in many ways this this defines our vision our sense of what's next"

        "transcript": "hi everyone my name is heather and i'm the person behind happy puppy truffles and today's a tuesday and so today i was going to do a little book review for you guys um from my personal collection of books that i have or that i've happened to come across uh whether it be through the library or uh stores of course and i really when i was thinking about stuff to share with you guys i know i shared the uh noah's magazine because i just received it but really when i think about origami and who my favorite artist is i'd have to say my favorite artist is tomoko i've loved her boxes and this is the first first book of hers that i ever got and it's just such a fun book and i think i actually bought it in japan at a bookstore but it's in english so um but it's it's just such a fun book and has has so many great fun designs i'm if you're familiar with tomoko fusay's designs she does a lot of modular work and um i can just kind of show you guys the designs here uh she works with basic squares hexagons heptagons octagon shapes and then just with some modular pieces putting them together and then just changing up some of the ways that things are folded um with the pieces initially so that you get different kinds of really cool pinwheel designs really colorful finished pieces and the thing i like so much about it is that her directions are super easy to understand there's really clear illustrations that go from step to step also the folding itself is not that hard so it's not that discouraging to a beginner to try to make one of her boxes i also think that um you know it's the fun part of it is that you're doing a modular origami project and you might need 4 8 10 12 15 16 pieces of paper but it doesn't feel like i'm taking as long as it does when i try to make a kusudama for example you know making kusadama just gets so tiring you're you're making millions of seams of irises and then it's like yay i'm finally done good lord this took me forever her stuff makes me feel like i've actually accomplished something so um i'm also a huge fan of origami you can use i love feeling like things i've made have become decorations and useful things in my house so i love the feeling that i've created something out of really pretty paper and it's finished and then i could put like my watch or my rings in it on my nightstand those kinds of things just seem to be really useful fun projects and uh you know what better fun than around christmas to make cute little boxes to give gifts in um and these you know you get started and you get used to making them and they go fairly quickly so um i would definitely say that these are this book and she has made so many different books uh not just about our uh boxes she also does some great ones about uh kusudamas as well so she does a lot of modular work um i don't think this particular book that you're seeing here this joyful origami i know the japanese when they make a book title they always have weird names and words for it um but i don't particularly think this one is available anymore actually um it was copyrighted in 1995 but i've seen i don't think i've seen it available on amazon i'll look at the links and show you guys just a general list of all of her works that you can get um but uh the models that are in here are repeated in other versions and publications so there's certainly you know so many different kinds of choices for her stuff so this is one of my pride and joys and i just enjoyed making her boxes so much and i think from as a beginner and just looking at those really clear easy to follow descriptions um the only thing i think i would give any argument to is that some the description of how to piece things together is maybe not as clear as it could be and that's where certainly videos come into play so much and i just wish that the whole world of origami was a little more open to sharing that world through videos because i think it's so hard to visually in a two-dimensional drawing description show how to complete some of these origami projects and uh you know having a video to show how the assembly works is so helpful but as many of you know tomoko fousey asked me to remove her work and so i have done that to respect her requests of course there are some other people up on youtube who do still have her videos up maybe because they have been given permission or don't know about that whatever it might be don't let that discourage you from enjoying her work she's an amazing artist and really one of my favorites so that's just a short introduction to joyful origami boxes and um just some really fun and easy stuff the isbn numbers here i'll make sure to include it but i don't know if you're gonna find it by this way but it's zero eight seven zero four zero nine seven four three um and like i said i think there are other choices too i'll try to put together a collection for you guys to look to peruse on amazon and see which ones might be of interest to you um i chris personally in my library of books because i had to limit a lot of things that i moved i don't have anything but this right now but i do hope ins in the future to buy some more so i can share them with you guys so um if you have any comments or questions please uh let me know i think tomoko says one of those artists who has published so many books in other countries and in english especially that you'll have no trouble finding something by her there are some other artists i've done tutorials for in the past whose books are only available in japan in that case i can help you try to purchase them but her stuff you're going to probably have no trouble you'll have better luck better prices finding it in your own country probably but if you have any questions you need help finding them please let me know and i hope to talk to you guys next time bye you"

        "transcript": "[Music] what is going on everyone this is neri and today for you what is this in the first place what global thermonuclear war this is a this is a mod game though guys ladies and gentlemen this is a modded game of the month for two and there's no legitimate way to play this in a public match there's no legitimate way to set this up in a private match the only way you're gonna play this game mode is with some sort of mod or hacker infection or something of that you know some black magic like that now you guys are may already be familiar with this game mode um during mod for two's hey dave there was some videos about it but they're kind of few and far between a lot of people still uh to this day don't know what global thermal nuclear war is uh they when they when they hear that phrase they basically you know just picture it as the title that you get because there is a title you get if you call them two nukes you get a title it's got like a fiery background that says global thermal nuclear war uh but this is actually game mode and they actually you know implemented it into the game like the announcer actually says a global thermal nuclear war like they were actually thinking about having this as a game mode and i kind of think that'd be a great idea um this is actually a game that i would like to see in other games i think it's actually a great game with the minus the fact that it just simply does not work in my warfare 2 uh because of danger clothes i mean we're playing i'm playing with subscribers and my brother and some of my brothers friends in here because uh okay to give you guys a backstory do you guys a backstory of how we're even playing this game in the first place um my brother and his friends they were looking for like mod lobbies on mall for two i don't know why they were just doing it and while on this like modding website they found a link to a guy who was hosting a global thermal nuclear war and so they went in they played a few games then the guy ended the lobby but apparently it's like an infection it's an infection in the sense that um once you back out and you go to a private match it's automatically set for global thermal nuclear war so my brother actually hosted this lobby that we're playing right now but you know just the temptation to not use danger close is just it's just too it's too great everyone just uses danger gloves in the in this because uh the whole point of the game would actually let me go to the professionals i ain't gonna go to to the professionals who will describe this game up for you i'm going to call of duty.wikia.com which is basically a wikipedia page for call of duty and they define global thermal nuclear war as an insufficiently hidden multiplayer game type in call of duty model fair 2. each side fights to capture a tactical nuke in the middle of the map once the team has captured it the countdown begins and when the countdown is done nuke goes off nuke explodes killing all players on the map and winning the game for the team to actually capture the nuke uh for a team to capture the nuke players must lay within the area of the nuke and mind you guys the nuke is basically a bomb site and for every second that a player is in that area a point is given to that player's team once uh players have been wanting to play teams has scored 100 points or 100 seconds laying next to the bomb then the countdown begins uh it's a game mode only accessible through hacks or using them on a device and it actually even says on the page during the game type that teams are most often resort to almost exclusively using explosives to get the enemy off the tactical nuke which is pretty true it rains very very true um back them off reduce heyday like i said you know when like infections and mod lobbies and stuff like that were actually going on uh quite rampant uh every time you got like into one of these lobbies nothing with rpgs nothing but one man army tubes like it was almost impossible to even capture the nuke luckily we're playing with subscribers right here and it's basically you know uh only a few people were actually running around like teacher cars and stuff but it's a good game mode um reasons you know why i think it's a good game mode it's essentially drop zone but with the drop zone constantly being in the middle of the map and the enemy team's spawns being consistent if that makes any sense it's a consistent spawn like in drop zone obviously with the drop zone changing and like obviously it's model for three so the spawns are just everywhere uh we spawn especially here on high rise we spawn our building they spawn in their building it's a fair fight getting to the thing um if your team is the better team and you guys push up and you guess up around it while like let's say one or two people actually are capturing the nuke everyone else sets up around it it's a game that can require a lot of teamwork and i like that aspect of it another aspect i like about it is your team is not going to win unless you move which and java's talked i've talked about it in a couple different videos about like team deathmatch and how a lot of people enjoy team death match which that's fine if you guys like team deathmatch that's you know more power to you um the reason i don't like it is because with no set objective in the game it seems to me that people don't move as much and it's a lot more campy it's a lot more defensive style and i just don't enjoy game modes that don't have an objective and so obviously i'm gonna i'm an objective guy i like i like the objective i like objective game modes and when i see this i'm like this is a fun new objective game though because you know i play capture flag i play demolition i play headquarters i play domination i play sabotage i play search you know i play every possible objective game mode there is and this is a new one this play is completely different than any other objective game that i've ever seen ever and it's pretty fun man it really is fun and um i think people will enjoy it i think people enjoy it if this were a c see how he gets delayed right on it'll say capturing nuke i'm about to go on a giant death streak because i noticed you look the score in the bottom left-hand side of your screen 90-73 we're getting close actually winning actually capturing the nuke that's what i was worried i'm just getting on there trying to get my teammates and points best i can because like i said every one second that you're on there you get a point but let's say you have three teammates on there then every second you're gonna get three points you know it's better to have more than one person actually trying to capture this thing so it's definitely i don't know man like i said it's a fun game mode it's a different game mode uh it's gonna get to play completely different than you would play like say domination or headquarters or anything because the nuke never ever moves and zombie pigeon 45 you see right there he was laying out he was the first person to lay on it and then it wants to hit 100 since he was the first person to lay on he got credit for calling in the nuke the nuke is going off and yeah here's the end of the game guys we get the ranger kill at the end right there and the newt goes off and we win how awesome is it as a game mode that the whole point of it is to blow everyone up with the nuke and whoever gets to blow up everyone with a nuke is the one that wins the game but what i like about it is uh it's a very fast paced game mode it's very fast paced and people like drop something because fast-paced and it's kind of uh it's easier to get sniper clips so check this out you can get sniper clips in this game but too mind you these aren't this is anything special this was just from one game i figured i'd show it to you guys um man man man man if i wouldn't have gotten a hit marker on the second guy there were a nice little quad feed at the end but you guys see that though like a lot of people like you see a lot of like phase numbers big montage guys like they'll play drop zone because of fast-paced game mode people are always moving and uh somewhat somewhat easier to get clips because everyone's actually moving uh drop zone would be the ultimate one because there's actually consistent spawns it'd be fun i would love to see global thermal nuclear war in a different call of duty chances of that being in black ops 2 slim to none very slim to none uh but what you're looking on your screen right now is the games i posted up yesterday you guys may have missed uh this is actually a 102 kill for death m16 gameplay which i think you guys will enjoy but if you guys go ahead let me know in the comment section below what do you think about global thermal nuclear war if you have if you've played it let me know about your past experience with the game or if you haven't played it why do you what do you like about it judging based off what you've seen in this video if you guys go ahead let me know about that i'd definitely be interested to read about that uh that'd be pretty cool but if you're interested in this 102k m16 gameplay you can just click your screen right now it'll take you right to it you can also click the text right above you that will allow you to subscribe if you haven't already and just in case you're on like a mobile device or something like that which i care about my mobile viewers you guys are cool too there's a link in the description where it'll take you to both the subscribe module as well as as well as the video the 102 kills so hope you guys enjoyed remember the video hope you guys all have a wonderful day"

        "transcript": "[Music] [Applause] this is futsal it's not a five-a-side pocket-sized version of the beautiful game it's a thrilling sport in its own right over the last 20 years or so futsal has developed professional leagues in a number of countries full of skillful stars employing cutting edge tactics and the seventh fifa futsal world cup proved to be the perfect showcase [Applause] [Music] the event was hosted by thailand the third time the competition has been staged in asia with two venues in the capital bangkok and another three hours drive away in nakhon ratchasima the field had been expanded to 24 sorted into six groups with the top two and the best third place finishers moving into the knockout stage the thais opened the tournament against costa rica it was the fourth time they've participated and on the strength of their second place finish in the asian championships they had hopes of making progress a 3-1 win helped them qualify for the second stage although that was as far as they went the japanese included one of asia's finest footballers in their lineup at 45 years of age kazumura's career may be winding down but his presence at the tournament attracted a great deal of interest [Applause] the most important thing was that i was recommended strongly by coach miguel and by a number of members of the association it's a whole new challenge for me i want to contribute to making futsal more popular in japan and i think that by playing myself i can draw a lot of attention to the japanese futsal team that way our foots our family will widen japan failed to get beyond the second round but the interest generated by miura's role will surely stock up plenty of domestic futsal goodwill for the future [Applause] but for some teams participation was an end in itself the solomon islands are the dominant futsal nation of oceania four times champions yet they found the leap to world competition rather tough however they did have some assistance in their preparations for bangkok it's been extremely difficult the biggest advantage that we had coming over for the world cup was um the helping hand that came from this spanish football federation we had two weeks training in spain but um given that there isn't really a futsal caught in the solomon islands um the boys have had to train a basketball court which is far smaller and it takes time to adjust into playing in a regular sized court the solomon's opened with a 16 nil defeat to russia which was actually a major improvement as the same opponents but over 30 past them at the last world cup another double figure defeat to colombia followed so by the time they met guatemala in their final group match bags had already been packed then the game turned into one of the most memorable in the tournament guatemala for whom a draw would have guaranteed progress took an early lead but while the solomons may lack experience they're not lacking in skill and goals from stevenson and bula gave them the advantage at half time with guatemala still training 3-2 with less than five minutes left they decided to move their goalie to an outfield position but lose possession and it's a dangerous thing to do it gave the solomon 16 year old keeper anthony tallow the chance to seal his team's first ever world cup victory but while a place in the last 16 was the goal for many for brazil only the title would do they'd won four of the six previous world cups including the last in a penalty shootout and were determined to complete their own penta a fifth world title to stand alongside that of the outdoor seller sound it's one of the most played sports in brazil it's been played since 1950 and it's used in brazil as a tool to develop players some of the best footballers today players like neymar robinho zico ronaldo they all started with futsal and as it's one of the most popular sports it's not surprising it's uncovered many great talents but not all young futsal talent ends up playing outdoors the one true superstar of the indoor game is brazil's talisman falcao he's 35 now and has been on the national squad for nearly 15 years in that time he's played over 200 internationals and his goal in the victory over panama was his 337th for the indoor salasal giving him the international goal scoring record across all the games versions ahead of big soccer legend nenem but his body doesn't always do what it's asked these days a calf injury restricted his tournament to a series of second-half cameos has always been my greatest passion i used to kick a ball in the street with my friends and in brazil like in many other places around the world i suppose there's always a futsal court in your school i used to take a yogurt to school and after i'd eaten it i'd play by kicking the pot around always playing football i go back and forth between football and futsal but futsal was my choice because i always have the ball at my feet i always want to play and i didn't have enough patience to play football ever since i was a child i always wanted the ball at my feet futsal was my choice and i don't regret it facing brazil the quarterfinals were argentina in 57 previous encounters the argentines had won just two but no argentina team is ever intimidated by a brazilian shirt and this turned into quite a match quite against the run of play argentina took the lead [Applause] and then scored a second before half time [Applause] but then the second half saw brazil's half-bit superstar rise from the bench to change the game he helped prompt the first goal and then scored the equalizer himself and in extra time only one player could break the deadlock brazil safely through to the quarterfinals we'll bring you the rest of the tournament later in the programme"
