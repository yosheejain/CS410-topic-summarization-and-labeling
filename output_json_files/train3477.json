Tyson did you see who bought it from who's the next guy to buy it was a TV marketer named Paul Monet he's the I bought it for 1.3 million in 1999 he never lived there uh he has something in common with Mike Tyson convicted a conspiracy and money laundering charges 2007 he'll be in prison till 2018 well okay well in 2018 he has a grand probably graffiti steam room shall we and these a so I mean I just finally got behind paying the taxes on the property that's what began is that's what began as buddy problems it just reminds me of if any others you seen Foxcatcher been help me out with what the guy who Steve Carell's character that's like the creepiness of the open it back at the Foxcatcher right yeah that's literally the game again yeah it's like when you have those pictures and the pictures obviously make that connection to it because there's the snow on the ground you treason is dead it creeps me out like I couldn't imagine if you don't have 50 people to live with you any much of what Mike Tyson is doing just if it's just him in this and that I would I would most of all everybody everyone tonight is the same thing we could all stop we can all forget about buying it because it was sold at a sheriff sale again the guys in prison you know he never lived there sold at a sheriff's sale in 2010 to a health club entrepreneur named Ron hamilkar for $600,000 plus the back taxes that's what it went for six hundred thousand plus back taxes whatever they well sounds like you know we probably hundred thousand he never lived there either so as no is anybody ever been live here no cuz it's amateur he donated the property December 30 is a 2014 2014 to the living word sanctuary Oh which plans to turn the party pad into a this is from USA today into a house of worship and youth I never thought well I mean I suppose it might Dyson town his life around and becoming a poetic figure it's K it kind of comes full circle that his house is now going to be a spiritual place because he's now a spiritual guy later for his first soon those are photographs are taken by a guy named Johnny Jew 24 years old J Oh jasmine has to be clear uh-huh they just call him Johnny Jew that's an amazing story that nobody's lived there since 1999 and that's incredible that's ridiculous so for 1.3 million and 600,000 back taxes then donated just a cool thing to tweet about be like I I bought Mike Tyson's house once yeah no big deal yes definitely gained some photos yeah you have to is that a thing is that I think young people say I bought like I went in there and shot like a pop-up shop tonight you should be used to that Miami queuing xmn you were with me alright guys I like that so that's the future about Mike Tyson's of ranch ocean clean"

        "transcript": "how everyone this is Ellen akshay giving you a view of Sonic own age for ps3 and xbox 360 first things first let's talk about the story story is pretty simple dark regnum fix sonic into the kind supersonic and slows his power and harnesses it to break about the planet in the race an ancient being called Dark Gaia and as a side effect song turns into what they call the werehog yeah it's a stupid name enough and whatever it's night time he turned into that sonic me to flying Chihuahua named chip who's lost his memory and they travel all around the world looking for the temples of Gaia to a store plans pieces back together and get chips memories back along the way they meet tails Amy at a new character professor pitbull and that's pretty much it I think it's one of the better storylines and the stock series due to its simplicity although personally i prefer chaos over Dark Gaia next let's talk about the graphics the game is beautiful in both the cinematics and the actual gameplay the cutscenes especially in the beginning and the ending of the game are amazing it's not much of an exaggeration to say it's nearly pixar quality as for engine stays in a date stages everything is detailed pedigree it looks very bright but realistic at the same time the nice stages they don't look quite as good it's still pretty music is also fits the theme for each search properly like the themes and the possibilities better than it's pretty good now let's get on to the actual gameplay starting with the daytime stages the base ninjas are really perfect don't really have any to fight about this Intel sonic should be created as classmates palm rails running such antibodies and intricate platforming sections we can constantly transitions from Brady to Timmy tee we went back to life if that's so very similar a favorite daytime stage of AD bag I don't really know why that just seems really fun one thing I should know however later in the game some of the stages for a gremlin and you will die a lot there are also accident aren't necessary to beat the game but you can play whatever you want it will honestly kick the cotton so you hit fake number I like that where the games have challenged these days so slow yo you guys did it right this time you really did however the daytime stages aren't the only thing in the game you will also play through nighttime stages as the werehog where the game shape its feed her beat em up style gameplay and more thought-out platforming and fuzzies all I've heard from the major websites IBM and GameSpot is that these levels are so horrible the ruin the whole game you know I know where her levels are actually made pretty well they're nowhere near as fun as a daytime stages by any means they're not horrible it's in the ball feel the beat em up game play against such as part of war or having a sword and flat for me on this from games like prince of persia at the sands of time there are several combos you can pull off become rock but leaving experience points that you get by defeating enemies some of them are hard to pull off whatever and it makes this part of the game more of a button masher than anything a little later in the game if you have high enough stats you can do a special over to pull it down triangle on the ps3 or Y on the xbox 360 and you can take out most enemies and a single hit which is very useful the game lags a bit when there are a lot of enemies on screen but shouldn't hinder the gameplay any so the hare werehog stages not as good to stay not horrible and is a somewhat enjoyable experience at the end of each stage is a box very usually sliding Eggman in sonic levels one of Thark guys monsters and the werehog levels it feel big and out I think in both of these new day losses you pretty much we run around on a set track and so you get chance to attack and then night thoughts is you have to figure out fossils witness let's a kit that way they're pretty fun that's boring anything but in the final boss just awesome it's what you'd expect the final box if you like it yeah singapore about pretty well also between this stage is a hub look it doesn't really serve much of a purple they're nice to look at what the pulao ting times in them with them a bit and with that I'll go into the one major problem Evans drinking it Sun and Moon medals the hidden every stage for a certain number of huge new area they're just a pain to find when I first played this game had no idea I needed to find them so I had to end up playing a bunch of old stages over and over and over again until I can finally get into the next stage I honestly didn't want to play the game of our while because of this almost ruined it for me seriously almost did so just remember to look for those during the warehouse stages so you can save yourself a lot of frustration on all Sonic Unleashed is a pretty good game and I recommend buying it if you're a fan of platformers and if not at least it's rented you see I you like and give Santa kameez a 7.5 5 10 good job [\u00a0__\u00a0] well I hope you all enjoyed this to hear this is your own and shades sign up"

        "transcript": "greetings from Land of Canon my name is Matt and today I'm doing secret spots on OverWatch now this first jump is an extremely hard strafe jump that you can make over to this it's like a small piece of ledge sticking out because there's like an invisible barrier everywhere but on this tiny little like you could see it I'm going to walk up uh against it and then it ends right about there where I shoot and then maybe with good Sprint jumping or whatever you can make to the one across the way but this is a great spot for infection cuz they're just going to be jumping down and everything it's hilarious also there's this this spot I mean obviously anybody who's seen the map for more than 5 Seconds knows about this map this spot but I just feel like it's obligatory otherwise someone's going to mention it like dude how did you miss this spot and I'm going to be like yeah go [\u00a0__\u00a0] yourself now here uh you can see that there's actually uh a press a to climb when there's not really one and you can get up here which is actually pretty cool although you can't actually [\u00a0__\u00a0] get anywhere here because there's like no no place that you can jump up and anything this is another great spot uh you could just go here and the thing is if you just regularly Sprint jump you can jump over to the top here and then continue on going to the other side I can see this being a great route for Search and Destroy once people figure out that it's doesn't actually work running down the middle and also here what you could do is you can actually just Crouch over on B and one of these uh in one of these edges and it's actually gives you a lot more cover than if you were just to be out in the middle so that's a cool spot also here what you can do is you can jump on this ledge and you can just regularly jump over to here and uh that that easy way makes this a bad spot but there's this way way where you can actually jump on the pallet and everything and it gets you up here which is a pretty cool spot and everything it's kind of useless but I still think it's cool also what you could do is you could Sprint jump over to this uh this thing but then because uh Activision's [\u00a0__\u00a0] they put an invisible barrier there and it's just completely useless also here what you could do is you could strafe jump over to these boxes and it gives you a weird line of sight I mean normally people don't really expect you to be here so I guess there's that uh next up on the on the crane you could do is you can actually just Crouch and move over to the right here and you can get under here which is amazing for infection and maybe good for one or two kills in online and then once you're done what you can do is you can just stand up move on over to the side and you can just jump right back up and you can continue on with your game which I thought was pretty cool I don't know if they put there on purpose but still I thought it was pretty cool and also here what you can do is you can just jump over the ledge and there's like a little thing here they could lie down maybe call an air support but also here this spot is got to be broken for infection like say that they don't have throwing knives if you sit here you're Invincible if they do have throwing knives you sit back here and you have this for cover from throwing knives they can still shoot hit you from below though and also what you could do is you could Sprint jump from here over to the top of the crane so there's an alternate way of getting at the top which is pretty cool and then over here since this is a complete copy paste of Modern Warfare 2 you can actually just inch over here and you got like this whole spool of wire that protects you from zombies gunfire whatever you know it's actually just a pretty good spot in general and then uh moving on to the next spot I just want to point out that you can get on all of those you can actually just shoot it and jump from here or you could just like maneuver your way in and out of all the panes of glass but this is the easiest way but this this side of the glass is not that great but this side is amazing because what you can do is you can shoot that window out and then stand on this ledge Sprint jump over here and this in it itself is great for covering a but then what you could do is you could pull one of these and you can just sort of inch off the left and you can land on this and look at that this is a great spot for infection you could probably kill anybody who's trying to jump down it's also great because I don't really think anyone's going to expect you're coming like to be here if they're coming from a you got to move slowly when you're on it though because you will fall out off if you move too quickly like that I was moving too fast and I just fell off also here this is a little WTF spot I found if you just jump on this generator and then jump over to this green portal potty you can actually stand on it but then they put an invisible barrier halfway up it's like what why would you do that that makes absolutely no sense so I thought that was kind of pointless but still cool and also like this is the final completely useless uh spot you know you can just do this if you want but I just want to say that this was a pretty cool map for secret spots I mean there's I bet there's some stuff that I'm missing just because the map's been out for two days I'm sure some other spots will be found so if there are I'm probably going to make another video on them because this is a really cool map I really like it this was one of the better Maps they've made for the DLC and yeah thanks a lot for watching guys peace and go check out oh yeah and go check out my old secret spots there's like annotations on screen and everything it like it like brings you through all of them it's pretty it's pretty awesome I designed it specifically for people on PC or Mac just basically desktops because on iPods you can't exactly have annotations it's just dumb anyway hope you enjoyed peace"

        "transcript": "hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to episode 32 of my starting from scratch series and look how lucky I was I came up against this guy with 41 chemistry and it's always an absolute pleasure to play against people like this um you know 41 chemistry although he did have Neymar up there so that was a bit of a threat but there lens picks up his first goal for the squad um he's the inform one and I quickly want to discuss uh just a little bit about him now one of the big decisions I made yet last night actually after yesterday's video that I uploaded which you know you guys are it's really awesome to see you guys getting so involved in this uh Road to Glory because you guys are leaving comments on what you guys would like to see what players you'd like to see me bu and I'm literally getting hundreds upon hundreds of comments every video just letting me know what you guys want and what's so awesome is that um I'm not doing like tons and tons of games ahead I'm usually about one one episode ahead of where I usually am as far as games go but you know one of the big things that someone recommended and I was like you know what this is this is actually a really good idea is that I should um sell informed lens and purchase RVP now one of the one of the main things you guys said was Cal you're wasting away inform lens on the right mid um position you know he he cost me just over 30k and he's being wasted away in the right mid you know at least if I was going to have an inform lens have him playing rightwing but unfortunately the formation that I run doesn't Supply it doesn't um have the rightwing position only has right mid and left mid so you know I I made that decision and I believe probably as this video is going up there'll be my um inform lens up on the market um I I'll probably sell them for around 33k and that's what I bought him for I'm sorry bought him for um but I I I should be looking to uh sell him and you know buy RVP it'll have to be the normal one because the upgraded one is like 60 odd, coins for the Xbox 360 so that's something that's a that's a pretty big decision for myself I'm going to replace that right mid with just the normal lens and here Sig um that's what I decided to call him another guy left a comment was like you know what Cal I don't blame you for not being able to say this guy's name so uh you know just go call him Sig so I was like right okay I'll just I'll just I'll just call him Sig and that's the plan so you know with that coming in unfortunately there will be no inform guy in my team yet because I really was hoping to have an inform player um in this team but RVP playing a striker is just going to be so much much more beneficial because I'm not going to lie with you guys I am struggling with this side I've never played with a side like this whatsoever and this formation isn't one that I'm too familiar with but I have seen air Japes anyone who knows air Japes um will know that he loves the 4411 formation and it looked really good in his video so I thought I'd try it but here I pick up castanos I think that's how you say it but this guy castanos I picked him up pretty cheap his long shot oh my gosh you guys will see a couple goals coming up here um I mean I scored long shots with well not long shots but you know just solid hard long drives that's what she said so um it'll be really interesting to see how he does and once again he's just there to um you know take over from duate if he's losing any Fitness and um it's important that I keep the depth of the squad and I have to take ellia there out just in case make sure you know Fitness is up there and uh you know keep rotating the squad and with the coins because I spent so much money on lens I didn't have enough to you know depth in the squad make the squad so that I could easily interchange players so I had to put like random bronzes in you know places that I really just didn't want to put them in anyways I come up against this Uruguayan Squad and uh it's got Forlan there Fernandez I don't know who that other Striker is but he's got the wrong position and formation um you know foran in this game he is good he's just a little bit too slow for my liking uh he is just a bit slow I I don't know if that reflects him well in real life but as far as FIFA goes he's just not quick enough for me and uh Sig there oh that's so dirty Sig you filthy animal that was a really nice chip and he is a good Striker I would like to see a bit bit more Pace on him uh but unfortunately he only has 70 something or low 80 is one of those two um one of the things I'm worried about with castanos though is the fact that his touch isn't the best it really isn't you know when you do fake shots things like that the ball tends to really drift away from you and I'm a complete fake shot Massacre player you know I will abuse those fake shots in and around those box whether I'm looking for the penalty or just looking for a way through um it's such an effective uh skill move it's simply to those of you who don't know to any of the you know you're a pretty new player if you don't know how to uh do the fake shot but it's simply you press um X and then a really quickly back to back and you can just roll your thumb across to do it and it's such an effective move and it's easy to do as well once you uh practice it a little bit but I I mean that's twice my keeper there Tyson has been beaten now one of the other uh comments you guys left you guys just scream Stenberg for as a goalkeeper so that player I completely forgot about him I completely forgot he was a Dutch player and you can guarantee that he will be on my shopping list because I know that when when I used my sria team he was Unstoppable he was an absolute beast and he he's up there with Joe Hart in this game those are probably my two favorite goalkeepers in this game um so effective so good and just you know Stenberg he's a big guy as well he plays for Roma to those who are interested and he's a cheap uh goalkeeper be just because the Syria is a pretty cheap League to be honest with you um but they are you know the guy gets a penalty and things were going back and forth back and forth but scripting it FIFA had written the script before the game had started there was no way I was going to win so he picks up a goal there in the 90th minute I hope you all enjoyed this video and be sure to check out vssg on the weekend Sun uh next Sunday um at 8:00 p.m. and I'll see you guys all later [Music] bye-bye"

        "transcript": "in the garage today we have a 2005 Chrysler Town and Country with a little over ninety four thousand miles on it it has a 3.8 VIN L engine the owner is concerned because the check engine light is coming on intermittently after she has been on the highway for a few minutes we checked the trouble codes found code Pio 406 this indicates the EGR voltage is high this vehicle has a digital EGR valve the only test procedure we could find for this code involves activating the EGR valve with the factory scan tool the problem is that most technicians do not have the factory scan tool at their disposal so what now after looking through the repairs on identify we have a 98% probability the EGR valve needs to be replaced but it would still be nice to know if the part is defective before replacing it we decided to activate the EGR solenoid manually and scope it to try and find the problem the pinout looks like this pins 2 3 & 4 are power and grounds pin 6 the activation control and in one is the EGR signal we first check the power and grounds they were all 4.9 5 volts this looks good so far then we connected the red trace of the scope to the number 6 pin the EGR control and the yellow trace to the number 1 pin which is the EGR signal we then tapped a grounded jumper wire to the back probe going to the EGR control pin 6 this action activates the EGR solenoid look at the resulting scope pattern we have a nice digital pattern showing the activation on the red trace of the yellow tray signal which should also look digital is uneven and broken this was done on a warm engine and now proves we do have a problem with the signal portion of the EGR the entire EGR valve is defective and needs to be replaced but what is going wrong inside the sensor portion of the EGR valve to cause this problem a state-of-the-art automotive testing lab at our disposal sure does come in handy we took the defective and a new EGR valve to the lab for testing first the wiring harness was connected to each of the EGR valve terminals and slipped through a hole in the side of the oven this harness will allow us to control the EGR valves why they are being heated then the valves are placed in the oven which is set to 141 degrees Celsius or 285 degrees Fahrenheit this is done to simulate the heat generated under the hood of the vehicle after about an hour of soaking in the heat they were tested at a zero to twenty nine percent duty cycle and 128 Hertz this is the new EGR valve signal as you can see it is a crisp clean digital signal this is the defective EGR valve signal and as you can now see is very uneven and choppy but what is going wrong inside the position sensor we carefully disassembled the sensor from the defective EGR valve and took it apart to find the answer after examining the board under the microscope we found the conductive silver has worn through at the point of contact and it is also separated the problem comes down to a design flaw in the pressure context and in the curing process that adheres the conductive silver to the board at Wells we are continually looking for ways to improve the original design of vehicle electronic components our engineers are developing a fix for this problem right now we are totally committed to all for the best parts available here's a tip when removing the old or installing the new EGR valve remove the top bolt and loosen the bottom bolt then tip the EGR valve down to hand remove the bottom bolt there is a tight fit that you can get the bottom bolt out and back in without removing the Ultimatum see you next time in the Welles garage and maybe one of our labs to you"

        "transcript": "well it was interesting because I was doing a doctoral dissertation on organ music and I knew that Fanny had written one organ prelude in F major and I figured there had to be more so I sort of stumbled on her music when I went to Barbara Owen and she suggested all these women composers of organ music who might be worth pursuing Fanny's music was the best of the lot and it was really excellent in a way that was very surprising to me and the first songs of hers that I came across were leader she'd written in 1846 that were just so exquisitly beautiful and I had to copy them out by hand from the library in Boston because they wouldn't let me Xerox them but as I brought them home and played them um my husband and I just were both amazed at what a very important and beautiful compositional voice this was uh very original not like Felix and yet of that school um you hear um the early 19th century you hear Beethoven and Schuman en list but you also hear a woman and a woman who is strong and has her own um identity beautifully portrayed okay well I met the music through Vicki um I I think Vicki and I met and she knew that I had done some work with women composers and she said have you ever looked at the piano music of Fanny mendleson um and so I started to look at it and what I was so astounded by is how first of all pianistic it is it lies well in the fingers there's two kinds of music one sounds harder than it is and one is harder than it sounds and her music is although it's very challenging it's very comfortable within the fingers there's composers like even brahs in Beethoven where it doesn't feel well in the fingers she lies beautifully in the finger so she must have been a Pianist was she a Pianist she she must have known what she was doing pianistically but there's a range to her music it's it's not derivative you you hear it and you you think it sounds like somebody but it doesn't it sounds like Fanny uh there's a range of strict tonality to a little bit of a toe into a tonality um and every piece has its own personality you and there are maybe a hundred pieces of solo piano music and for me to be able to introduce music to the public that is not uh has not been written yesterday I mean that I do dedicate a lot of my life to but to be able to introduce music where people can walk out singing the tune um is I think going to be Exquisite and to give pianist an alternative to the repertoire but she what an extraordinary personality she must have been to really try and supersede the obstacles of her day because you know it's it's it's difficult in any time that you live to listen to what Society is telling you you should and should not do to think think that you can do something different and then to have whatever it takes the strength or the determination to combat that because that's a lot of energy that's energy that people it's sort of the difference there when you're not fighting a racial problem you know we don't think about how they're that we we take things for granted and I think with men they in those days they didn't think about it they just went and they learned but women had to think about well Society doesn't want me to do this my family doesn't want me to do I'm doing it anyway so she died in May of 1847 and he died like November and he died uh after the summer yeah oh yeah so devastating but that's the kind of thing that happens with married couples who've been together for a long time that's correct that's correct and he did in the the few months that he had left he did go through her music and pick out the best of it that it's still not been published and saw to it see and I think that's his Penance I think so too yeah so that he saw to it that some of it was published that had not previously been published would that would there be a piece of music in the two albums that we've just recorded that you two could sort of agree upon as being something that someone had to hear one piece that would sum up what her strengths were which one would you choose I would choose yeah [Applause] this one oh this one that [Music] starts one I played and you said it's so sad is [Music] the pedal mix the whole thing [Music] and it has this whole stormy middle section and then at the end it comes back with that glorious theme again in octaves and then it's that wonderful thing at the end was the ped [Music] that's my favorite piece of everything [Music]"

John's course Tuesday May the 28th was the date of the very first race and the first winners were Charlie Collier on a matchless in the single cylinder class while R M Fowler won the multi cylinder category on a Norton Isle of Man TT is the greatest motorsport event of any kind in my opinion nowhere now or has the tradition of the TT no other motorsport event started as early as 1907 and has been held every year with the exception of war years since no other if no other current event has got a circuit like that man thirty seven and three-quarter miles on public roads and although they've improved them year by year they are still absolutely awesome and the thought of circulating the Isle of Man even now at an average speed of a whisker under 130 miles an hour is quite incredible to me my happiest memories of racing or of winning anything are the TT more than anything I've achieved in will sue bike it was TT that meant everything to me that's all my happy memories of racing the good times of racing there was look to the TT or a place he liked Ireland when I used to race you look at it you know it's not it's not just a role is it is it's by history isn't it it's not it's not just a piece of tarmac or a hill in Braille or the mountain course it's just it's just him CBS time begun isn't it and long it may continue didn't what would be an element I don't know I think I love man for the rider I think is the best is the back is the best victory it's like win the war champion because when you win an isle of man is is completely you have everything ahead of me so only only you don't have to think about about the danger [Applause]"

        "transcript": "to the pivot works steering stem replacement video in this video we'll show you how to install a pivot works steering stem bearing replacement set locate the bike on a stable platform and remove the front wheel and the forks from the triple clamps when the front forks are removed you can then release the front number plate retaining strap where it connects to the handlebars now loosen the triple clamp retaining nut this is the nut that attaches the triple clamp to the steering stem with the nut removed you can remove the handlebars and the upper triple clamp is one unit and rest it carefully on top of the bike we use a hammer and a punch to remove the retaining nut from the steering stem but you can also use a special tool several companies including honda make a special spanner for this nut once the retaining nut is free gently lower the steering stem including the front fender and lower triple clamp from the bike then remove the old bearings in the upper washer and all that's left behind is the steering stem bearing races and now for the important part a hydraulic press is required to remove the steering stem from the lower triples there is no other way to remove the lower bearing okay we're showing you what the shop does this is what the train professional does to remove the steering stem they apply some heat and using the hydraulic press they press the steering stem out of the triple clamps and along with it comes the bearing there's no way you should attempt this at home unless you happen to have a hydraulic press and some training in the use of that device the good news is that you can take your steering stem and lower triple clamp down to your local shop and they'll remove it for you for a nominal fee once you have the steering stem removed take the parts from the packaging carefully and keep the bearings and races together the bearings and races are machined as a pair as a match set so be careful not to mix them up and if you're doing the work yourself this is a good time to go ahead and freeze the bearings and now you can proceed to drive out the old bearing races from the steering head as you can see from the video we use a long special tool which is essentially a punch to drive the bearing races out of the head it doesn't take a whole lot of pressure to get these things out but you want to be careful not to scratch the inside of the steering head assembly okay in our case we had a little difficulty with the lower steering stem bearing race and since we were having a little difficulty driving it out we decided to remove the electronic box and apply some heat to the lower head assembly okay again we have a trained professional now applying some propane heat to the lower steering head assembly being careful to reroute the cables and of course keep the heat away from the gas tank with the steering head and the lower race heated up you should be able to drive it out as you see here in the video and we skipped ahead here a little bit we're already installing the lower bearing race using our bearing driver to make sure it stays in alignment and making sure absolutely certain that we have driven it in all the way this is critically important the bearing must be seated all the way in the frame and the same goes for the top bearing race if the bearing races are not seated properly all the way in the steering head they will loosen as you ride and the nut will continue to come loose possibly while you're riding resulting in injury or possibly worse so absolutely make certain to drive these bearing races all the way into their stop position okay you can see here from the video we're using a special purpose bearing driver that matches the outer diameter of the bearing race you can however use a large socket as long as it matches the outer diameter exactly the key is that you have to drive it in all the way and then it has to be even and you can see the bearing race here driven in all the way it's important to note that is below the level of the steering head now once you've got the bearing races in place it's time to pack the bearing with some good quality bel ray lubricants in this case some grease and install the tapered bearings into the head along with the sealing washer that goes on the top and the same thing for the bottom in the reverse order and the next step is that our professional has frozen the steering stem before reinserting it into the lower triple clamp and before applying the hydraulic pressure from the press and again we're showing this for reference only unless you happen to be a professional and own a press you won't be doing this part of the operation but this gives you an idea how it works and how it should look when it's reassembled you can see that the lower tapered bearing is in place and now you're free to reinstall it into the steering head assembly and put the nut back on the top of the steering stem and now we are tightening down the steering stem retaining nut using a punch and a hammer which is the most common fashion however if you have a special spanner wrench you can use that and the trick to this step in the operation is to tighten down the nut to the point where it is securely in place and there's no up and down play in the steering stem yet the steering head or the triple clamps are free to rotate smoothly okay what our mechanic has done here is purposefully over tighten the nut and then backed it off until he got exactly the right feel on the triple and the final step in the video is to reattach the upper triple with the handlebars torquing the nut down to factory recommended torque specifications reattach the forks in the front wheel and you're ready to go ride safe"

        "transcript": "all right fellas welcome to the first episode of the q a pvp guide for unholy death knight i apologize for taking so long to make this video it hasn't been taking me a long time it's just the fact i've been  really seriously ill for about two weeks so i apologize for that i guess okay so the first question is from daniel lager kiev okay sorry i can't pronounce that how do you hold up your dps in pvp is unholy what is best on julio frost now that's a very very generic question uh that's going to take about 10 minutes of explanation so what i'm going to do is there's a link in description from a pvp guy but in this video i'm just going to teach you some high priorities that you need to be you need to learn to improve your dps as an early dk okay so the biggest priority is keep your dots up keep the dots up on every single target in arena or rpg the second priority use an ability on every single global cooldown right this could be a rune it could be a death coil it could be horn of winter it can be crowd control could literally anything just make sure you're using everything make you make sure you're using the ability especially a rune and every single global card cooldown whenever the rune comes off cooldown because that generates power and ring power is extremely important because generates shadow infusions shadow infusions increase your pet damage okay it's not just like when you get five it makes him a big guy and does look more damage it's like it's like a steady thing like one death coil is a percentage another death core another percentage your pet damage is nearly half of your damage seriously serious amount of damage when he's in doubt transformation he's doing just as much as damages you so it's very important you always use your death cards as soon as they're available to get him in doubt transformation as quick as possible increase the damage okay um third one whenever target's obviously uh below 35 percent health i think it's 35 pretty sure use your soul reaper sorry but seriously good evan you kind of like have to do enough damage and health absorb until that sorry to do its damage because where saw reaper does the damage it is gg seriously because you're looking at 70k damage that's non-correct when it creates it is win because it's like 140k crit okay and lastly i'll talk briefly about necrotic strike which really does take too long to explain uh when it comes to death friends make sure you always have your death runs up when it comes into chronic striking um you know don't just do one or two try do for trying to free at the least you know 24 try and do about five six if you can make sure when you burst and all your necrotics make sure you can keep the stack up now to keep the stack up you're gonna be generating blood charges generate blood charges you have to use your runes to generate power then you use your reading power with death coils you use your death cards generator blood charges when you get to about five but you'll get about six then you use the uh the blood charge and you get back a death room to maintain that stack maintain the necrotic health absorb stack for as long as possible now yeah second part of the question what's better than holy frost um this each spec excels in different elements of the game more than you have now to put it simply in flag games in rater battlegrounds and templar kottemog katamogu whatever it's called frost excels because of a massive crit damage it can do um in sync with the damage debuffs from when you're holding a flag you know when you hold a flag in rate battlegrounds or backgrounds you take a debuff right so you take more damage when you start to get big crits and frost it's definitely going to benefit you more because you're doing some seriously big credits and that's going to score kills pretty quick and the same with temple cuts up kotamogi you could do like 400k crits you know you could just jump in the middle do a 400k crit there you go object go and pick it up gg that's why frost excels and those kind of backgrounds but the rest honestly unhears a lot better especially on king of the hill games like a rafi basin just spread aoe damage you're going to be doing because of those kind of maps it's always everyone's always bunched up together in big group fights you're going to do seriously amount serious good amount of aoe pressure to do tons of damage i once did or was it 70 million damage screenshot here i think it's 70 million of uh damage in our rafi basin and for arena well dk more defensive and it has more control simple as that so it's better for arena and that has better what's the word synergy with other classes okay next question is from malice molin what is best free comps for unholy dk well best i think the best comps debatable is phdk which is death knight hunter paladin right you can also play with a lock you can also play with an elemental shaman and yeah those three are like the surreal they're seriously strong comps now you can play things like tsg or vanguard cleave which basically rep paladin or warrior i mean they're a lot of fun but they're not as viable because it's really all about doing a shitload of damage there isn't really enough uh enough synergy for crowd control you know it's really lacking chain crowd control okay that's all we have time for for day fellas each episode i'm going to end with a tip okay today's tip is you can generate shadow infusions you know the ones that probably paying transformation by using death coil on your pets okay so if you can't do a death coil but you just want death call away from getting your pet into dark transformation make a macro here it i'll show you there it is um before death call that pet and use it then use on your pet pop them in dark transformation do some hell of a damage benefit from the extracurricular troll that you get from the dark transformation okay thanks guys for watching the video definitely more of these coming soon because it's so  easy to make um and show"

        "transcript": "today I'm going to show you how to make foolproof scones these guns work first time every time now all you need to make these full proof scones is four cups of self-raising flour two eggs 2 tablespoons of butter 2 cups of milk and 2 dessert spoons of sugar now for those of you that don't know this is a dessert spoon and two of those equals a tablespoon so two tablespoons of butter 2 dessert spoons of sugar now as well we're making scones you're going to need yourself that's gone cutter and they come in all sizes now the size I like the best is this size it's roughly the size of a narrow glass top so if you don't have scone cutters you can use a glass or another cookie cutter of around the same size these are cookie cutters on one side and scone colors on the other side and I think they cost $5 35 for the whole set so do yourself a favor and get yourself some of those now the recipe I'm doing today makes roughly 20 to 24 seconds depending on the size of this foam cutter that you are using so the first thing you need to do is just crack your eggs into a bowl add the two dessert spoons of sugar and then just beat with a fork until these are combined and just put that to the side the next thing you do is you take your saucepan you add your two tablespoons of butter just melt that on the stovetop so they're they're melted butter and to the melted butter what you need to add is two cups of milk so sift four cups of self-raising flour into the bowl add the butter and milk mixture add the egg and sugar mixture and then using a knife just cut through that mixture until it's all combined don't use a spoon it's very important that you use a knife your songs will be aerated they won't be tough and flowery they'll be absolutely beautiful soft scones which is the way you want it so just cut through like that continually turning your bowl around get the flour off the side and as you can see that's a really wet dough and I know you're thinking hang on that's a bit too wet for strong as well it's really not this is exactly what you're after so just sprinkle some of that self-raising flour on the bench and I know this looks like a lot better to have too much than to list because you don't want sticking on your bins and just turn that spon dough out onto the flour using a knife now I don't want to see a spoon anywhere near your scones okay the next thing you do is get plenty of flour on your hands and try pressing this out until it's around about an inch thick like that you don't want these scones to be like a bread dough you just have that very soft dough pushed out just like that then taking your scone cutter dip that in a little bit of flour and start pulling them out and as you cut them out put it into your greased baking tray so another thing with scones is if they really love company so just make sure that you push them snugly up against each other so there's your pan of scones it looks like we got 24 out of that batch exactly there was a little bit left over if you wanted to do a couple more you put it in a preheated oven at 230 degrees Celsius for roughly eight to ten minutes or until they're just starting to go golden on top there's no better way to serve sconce than fresh from the oven while they're still warm with strawberry jam and cream"

I\u2019ve entered the BP Portrait Award probably about\n6 times prior to being eventually selected for it. And on each occasion, the thought\nthat I\u2019d get in and didn\u2019t\u2026 And then eventually this portrait of Harry Patch was\nselected. It was quite topical at the time obviously Harry Patch, the last Tommy, had\nactually died during the run of the exhibition and so it made it even more poignant, and\nthe fact that the image was used as posters across the Underground. I did feel quite proud\nthat I\u2019d sort of caught a moment in history which I was, felt privileged to be involved\nin. Painting Harry Patch was probably the most\nmoving of situations I\u2019d been in, I think, probably in my life I think, because I\u2019d\nbuilt myself up to it for quite a long time. I\u2019d initially thought about painting about\n8 years before I did it. And I wanted to be the person to paint the last person to set\neyes on the trenches, and experience the First World War. And, for me, seeing him the first\ntime, he was at the time living in a retirement home and he was, he\u2019d dressed for the occasion\nso he\u2019d been wearing medals and things. I came into this area and he was sitting on\nhis own. And he just looked like a man who was entirely on his own, he\u2019d had none of\nhis contemporaries around him. The man was 111 when I saw him. So, it really overwhelmed\nme. And I think that helped for the portrait. Now, had I worked from reference from photographs\nand not met him, it wouldn\u2019t have worked. That, for me, consolidated the idea of having\nto be with the subject, and work with the subject and experience it. And then, that\nhelped me then make the work in the volume that I did. Successful portraits are ones which are ultimately\na good painting, a good picture. And that we don\u2019t feel as though we have engage with\nthe sitter. They become the portraits in their own right. Much like a writer would start\na story, from a particular experience and then go off on a tangent, something that\u2019s\nwell away from an actual truth about a subject, but that\u2019s underpinned by the subject being\na sitter."

        "transcript": "what's up guys my name is ace and today I have another great drill for you guys and this is designed to significantly improve your reaction time in a gunfight let's get into it okay so the entire purpose of this drill is to develop a neural pathway that allows you to instantly react to a gunfight without even consciously thinking about it this means we're essentially trying to eliminate the step between your brain recognizing that there's an enemy on your screen and your thumbs or in the case of a PC user your fingers making the movements to react to that with enough practice you'll begin to notice that you automatically lock on and start firing at an enemy without actually thinking to yourself there is an enemy there now move your thumbs and kill him this is just going to happen on its own and therefore at a much faster pace so to set this drill up we're going to go into a private match select a small to medium sized map that has somewhat of a round shape to it rather than more of a linear shape and I like to use strike zone or Warhawk or something similar to that and the reason for the roundish type map is we're basically going to be running laps around the map and these maps work best for that but we'll get into that in a bit for the game mode we want free-for-all and next we're going to go into the game options and set the score limit to unlimited and the time limit to whatever you want but I recommend doing at least 10 minutes and the longer you do it the better the results will be since like any drill this is all about repetition so now we're going to go down to the gameplay options and enable hardcore mode and then we're gonna disable kill streaks and field orders next we're going to go back up to the team options and it's really important that you set your gameplay options before this because when you turn hardcore mode on it will automatically add a respawn delay which we don't want so we want to set that to none moving on we're gonna set up seven bots and I like to use regular bots but if I'm feeling very confident I'll use harden bots and I'll explain why towards the end of the video so that's our setup now let's get into the class that you want to use I'll first list what you must have on this class and then everything else will just be up to you so first for a gun you want to use an SMG or an assault rifle and it doesn't really matter which one you choose just use one that you're comfortable with for attachments you'll want extended mags and then whatever other attachment you want now for perks you must have ready up marathon quick draw and scavenger and for the other perks that you don't necessarily need but I highly recommend agility or sleight of hand all right so now that we have everything set up let's get into the game the entire goal with this is to run laps around the map and only come out of sprint to kill enemies you also aren't allowed to come out of sprint until you actually see an enemy on your screen so no cheating and getting ready for an enemy that you hear coming first now when you run into an enemy you want to react as fast as possible aim and fire you want to try your best to ensure that you land your first shot but the focus is more on speed rather than accuracy so as soon as you see that enemy come out of sprint aim-down-sight and then fire if it's at point-blank range there's no need to aim down sight but in any other situation you want to force yourself to aim down sight because it's almost always a good habit to aim down sight at your target and your training for muscle memory with this so you don't want to develop the bad habit of firing from the hip in every single situation so honestly the drill is that simple just keep doing laps and racking up the kills and the goal is simply to develop a rhythm so that your brain can fall sort of into a trance-like state where it begins to react naturally to the situation of seeing an enemy on the screen and you don't have to think about it anymore if you die don't worry about it just keep moving and consider changing direction every couple of laps to sort of mix up the situations that you find yourself in if you're dying often I highly recommend lowering the skill level of the box until you can confidently develop a rhythm so now it's time to explain my reasoning for everything in the drill because I often get questioned about some of the aspects of my drills so first why all the sprinting and running laps around the map this is to maximize the number of gunfights while also ensuring that the enemies will almost always be in front of you also we want our brain to be busy performing some sort of a task when it gets interrupted to react to an enemy if your sound whoring or you're just aiming down sight around every corner for this drill you're going to be training yourself to prepare for a gunfight rather than react quickly and this drill is all about improving your reaction time so next up why do we choose hardcore this is so we can kill quickly and there's also a punishment for not reacting quickly because you died nearly instantly this drill isn't about accuracy it's about locking on fast and being the first one to fire in addition to this hardcore removes your mini-map so you can't really cheat and sort of prepare for an enemy that has popped up on the radar you always want it to be a surprise when you run into an enemy while doing this drill one last thing you may be wondering is why are we using regular or hardened bots and wouldn't it be more beneficial to use veteran bots this is somewhat similar to my accuracy drill these bots are designed to be targets to train on it if they're constantly killing you before you can realistically react to them you aren't doing yourself any good remember you want to develop that rhythm to really drill this into your head and if you're being killed constantly there is no rhythm there on the other end of the spectrum we don't want recruit bots because there's no real punishment for reacting slowly to them they just give you way too much time to react and this is why we want regular BOTS or if we're feeling like regular BOTS are way too easy we can go on to hardened BOTS so if you guys have any other questions about this drill please feel free to ask me in the comments below so that's the drill I use to improve my reaction time while playing Call of Duty if you have an idea for another drill that you'd like me to feature or you have some aspect of the game that you would like me to develop a drill for please let me know in the comments below if you enjoyed the video a like is always appreciated and don't forget to subscribe for more if you haven't already I'll talk to you guys next time

        "transcript": "hello everybody I I'm going to teach you a magic trick today and now this trick is called um the anvelope prediction so here are things that you need for this trick envelope one deck of cards and one replica of a card in that deck in this case mine is the eight of diamonds so first to start out this trick you take the deck put it over there now you grab the envelope what you have to do is you have to take this card and put it inside the envelope and then seal the envelope so next what you do is you just put that aside whatever you want take the deck of cards now as you can see I already put the eight of diamonds on the bottom so with the and then this is actually the same card that I put in here so these are both the eight of diamonds so now you take the eight of diamonds diamonds put that on the bottom so now you take the deck and fan it out now what you need to do is you need to get somebody to be able to do this to you can use and I would recommend you having somebody to practice it on cuz they can tell you like if they saw anything so what you do is have the deck and now ask them to tap a card so is say they tap this one now what you'll do you'll show them that card and then what you do is you can see it's taking me a little time for to do it because I'm actually doing something I'll tell you what that is in a minute so then take a card and then you show them what that bottom card was cuz you just cuz it was in here take the top half put on the bottom and it's here so eight of diamonds is there but you may be wondering how is the eight of diamonds there when it was Dr on the bottom so I'll tell you that in a minute and then of course what you do is you ask them to open the anope take out what's inside and of course the cards will be the same so now start over so take the card go inside the envelope seal put it somewhere like maybe somewhere secret or something so now you take the replica card it has the deck take this card and you're going to put that on the bottom so why it's there is because you're actually doing a secret move here I'll show you what that is so I'll do this trick at a different angle right here so now eight of diamonds is right here so show them the deck so what I'm doing is I actually pick up the card and I put it like this so you can see that it's the key of it's kind of half a little bit on the cane of diamond I mean Hearts but it's also on most of the rest of the cards so what this allows you to be able to do is once right there if they tap a card say this one and what you can do is Slide the that card the eight of diamonds over so that looks like they actually picked the eight of diamonds which of course they did not but that's what this whole trick is about this is the key move if you don't have this down don't do the trick so just practice this getting the C and while you're moving the eight of diamonds on the deck what you can do is you can um take it you can like make eye contact and talk to them cuz that distracts them from what you're doing right here when you grab it put it under so then they pick a card say this one and tap it what you do is just slide it over but this card is really the 10 of Hearts but you're sliding it over so it looks like it's the eight of diamonds that's why they tap it cuz if they didn't tap it they would take a random card so and you don't want that because that would be bad because then the trick is ruined so make sure that they tap a card don't let them pull a card cuz if they pull a card you're done with that trick so show it to them get it over have them take the card and now so of course it's on the bottom so now what you can do this is what I like to do so you can save the eight of diamonds and you can say well that card looks familiar I don't know why I've seen that before wait oh I know why could you please open this and then they'll open it and then of course they will pull out the eight of diamonds and they will be in amaz so that was the envelope prediction well thank you for watching oh"

        "transcript": "[Music] [Music] it's funny I look at this book that we call the Bible and I open it up and I flipped through some of the pages and from the outward appearance it just looks like any other book you know it has chapters that tell a story from beginning to end and for many people it is just any other book but the thing is it's different it's one of a kind in fact it's the only book on the planet where God himself is the author in which God himself Reveals His character Reveals His truth and reveals how he wants his creation to live taking this into account you would think as Christians today that this book would never leave our sides that we would read it day and night in fact the opposite is true you know stats say that less than 10% of people in the church today have read their entire Bibles we say we believe the Bible yet we don't take the time to read it which leads to the question how do we truly know what we believe which leads to the question how do we truly know who God is how do we know how he thinks and feels about things if we don't read this book you now we have all these ideologies about who God is but where do they come from you know our parents our teachers our pastors the world you know what they have to say may be true and it may be false but so often we rely on this middle man when we ourselves can go straight to the [Music] source it says in 2 Timothy 3:16-17 that all scripture is breathed out by God and later on you see him saying how it's profitable for training in righteousness and Paul addressing Timothy as this new leader in the Church of Ephesus and he's stressing how important it is that he's founded in Scripture that he's founded in the truth in God's word because there are people that going to come along the way to try and deceive him and lead him astray and it's so important that he's founded in God's word so he can stand firm and that he can continue to walk on the straight and narrow and it's the same in the church today it's so important that we read this book because it helps us to distinguish between between what is right and what is wrong and ultimately stops us from being led astray by false teaching and you have prominent leaders in the church today that say such things as when you become a Christian no all your problems will go away you'll be abundantly blessed you know if you believe this message if you believe these words if you're obedient if you have enough Faith then you'll be blessed with health wealth and prosperity and people hear these things and they believe these things but when they don't turn out the way that they were supposed to they don't question the teacher they question their [Music] faith it says in Matthew 4:4 that man shall not live by bread alone but from every word from the mouth of God and Jesus gives us this picture of God's word as this spiritual food something needed and something that's vital for us to sustain us to sustain life you know when we read the Bible we find God and that's where we find life because he is our creator the very source of life in Philippians 38 Paul says I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus he counted everything as rubbish in comparison do we have that same desire God is saying I'm right here in the Bible the Bible is an open invitation for you to know me if you would only take the time to read it so I say this not to condemn you or discourage you but I say this to encourage you and to challenge you to read your Bible to find God to find his truth and to find how we're supposed to live as his created beings ultimately as we begin to read this book can understand these things we can are equipped and we can begin to effectively share with others [Music]"

        "transcript": "hey guys welcome to uh workout c of thermogenic 30. after your body weight warmup you should have started the clock while you're doing your bodyweight warm-up we're getting into workout c right now there's five exercises in this circuit uh same thing 30 seconds each this time you're going to rest after 45 seconds so you're going to take a 45 second rest immediately after you've done these exercises and then repeat it one additional time you're going to start off with dumbbell split squats we're going to go 30 seconds on each side so i've got my dumbbells here pick them up one leg forward one leg back bracing my abs and much like the bulgarian split squats that we did earlier you want to focus all your weight on that front leg mainly the glute keeping your back straight abs nice and tight down and then push through that front leg that back leg essentially is just kind of acting as a kickstand so we're going to go 30 seconds on each side so i'll switch sides here for you chest out shoulders back got my abs braced okay so immediately after that we're gonna do a split stance shoulder press with a three second eccentric so the eccentric is the lowering portion of the exercise so i've got my dumbbells here split stance means one leg forward one leg back so slightly so if i've got my left foot forward here my right foot is going to be forward in the next circuit so i'm bracing my abs tightening up i'm going to imagine pushing my body away from the belt so that'll keep my shoulders down and back and then we're going to go three two one all the way back down push myself away and three two one and again three two and one so we've got that for 30 seconds immediately after that you're going to do a dumbbell romanian deadlift so i'll give you an angle focus on really pushing your hips back you need to bend your knees for flexibility issues and by all means do so but the most important thing when you're doing this exercise is making sure that you've got an arch in your back so you want to keep your back fully extended your spine fully extended come down under control and then right back up fire with your glutes and finish okay so right after that we're going to do 30 seconds of tricep extensions on the trx get this ball out of the way so tricep extensions on the trx palms are down embrace my abs really want to focus on packing my shoulders or keeping them down and back this will be as much an ab exercise as it is a tricep exercise we're going to come down under control and then fully extend our elbows all the way out 30 seconds here but really try to keep your elbows in and we've got 30 seconds so tighten up your glutes when you're doing that and that'll protect your lower back really give you a great strain in your abdominal so it's a good abdominal exercise and then to finish we're going to do 30 seconds of body weight rows and we want to keep our arms relatively close together so we want our elbows to pretty much brush our rib cage while we're doing this exercise so i'm going to set myself up brace my abs elbows nice and tight together as i pull up and we're going to go 30 seconds of the body weight row so you notice that as i'm rolling i'm really pulling keeping everything nice and tight together i'm not pulling out here and trying to squeeze that way i want to keep the shoulders depressed elbows nice and tight to the body so after you've done the rows you're going to rest for 45 seconds and then we're going to repeat that circuit one more time remember 30 seconds for each exercise and then we're on to our finisher okay guys so this is the final circuit this is like your finisher remember you're about halfway there now so you're going to do this circuit for the duration of the 30 minutes you're going to do this for the duration of the 30 minutes this time you're gonna be resting for 30 seconds uh between the circuit first exercise is going to be a low box jump so i've set my bench up here hopefully i won't jump out of the frame like i did the last time you're going to jump up and then step down so nice low box jump developing power immediately after that we're going to do a close stance uh goblin squat so i've got my dumbbell here get my hands underneath i've got a close stance so my regular squat stance will probably be about there i'm going to bring it in maybe a little a tad wider than uh how wide my hips are come down and then right back up and squeeze through immediately after that close square push-ups so elbows tight to the body really focusing on your triceps here so you want your elbows pretty much rubbing it up against your rib cage so if you remember the trx rows that we did before it's like the exact opposite of that and then really focus on that lockout at the top and then to finish we're going to do 30 seconds on each side of switch lunges so i'm going to cross my hands over my chest you can put them on your hips if you want as well step forward with the right then backward with the right forward with the right backward with the right and you do 30 seconds of those and then with the left forward and then back 30 seconds there immediately after that you're going to rest for 30 you're going to repeat that circuit as many times as you can within that 30 minute time frame right after that you're done and that'll be it for the tt thermogenic 30 workout for september"

        "transcript": "the 2012 BMW 650i Coupe let's take a look so under the hood of this piece we have BMW's all new 4.4 liter twin turbo V8 now we'll take off the vanity cover so you can see under here I won't touch anything because it's on but basically here the Innovative thing about the 650i's engine is that the twin turbos are in the Valley of the engine rather than on the sides so that means the exhaust and intake is reversed from a normal V8 engine so if you're looking for a 650 Coupe you have the choice now between three engines you have the single Twin scroll turbo inline six good for 315 horsepower you have this twin turbo 4.4 liter V8 good for 400 horsepower and 450 pound-feet of torque and of course you have the all-new BMW M6 engine which has just been announced and that's 560 horsepower now in this particular model all-wheel drive is available as it is with the inline six and so that makes handling much more secure than it would be in the m6 in the wet weather of course although the m6 probably does sound more exciting foreign 400 horsepower but the big thing about this engine is that it delivers all 400 of those horsepower from 5500 RPM to 6400 RPM and it delivers 450 pounds of torque from just barely over idle 1750 RPM all the way up to 4 500 RPM so the broad very broad torque range really helps the acceleration in this car BMW claims a 4.9 second zero to 60 time but we achieved 4.23 back to back without a problem in this model and that actually is just about as good as the Jaguar XKR or the Mercedes CL550 all-wheel drive now we should note that the CL550 all-wheel drive will do that rain or shine and the 650 with the rear wheel drive setup as we have here will really only do that in perfect conditions [Music] now acceleration is very good and it's met with some really great noises from this engine um you know again 400 horsepower really helps a lot the best thing about the 650i is that the handling is not exactly the best in the world I mean there are cars that handle way better than the 650 but what it is is very confident feels very good even in the two wheel drive version handling is very confident except for the wet BMW tells us their new 6 series is their first all LED car now it's all LED all the time that's high beams low beams turn signals fog lamps and yep even LED vanity mirrors trunk space and a coupe are convertible is not really a huge thing because everybody knows they're small but in the 6 series the trunk space actually is fairly good not quite as commodious as the CL that we reviewed last month but you know still nevertheless very good you can definitely fit luggage for two away here and that actually is good because you really can't fit back passengers which we'll look at right now so as you can see the BMW is technically a four-seater all of these rear seats are a hair cramped you know I'm six feet tall I drove the car here so the seats adjusted for me and I can't actually fit with my legs in the foot while in the rear seat and there's really not enough Headroom to sit upright however my spare sport coat over here in the back it feels very special right here in the padded luggage area [Music] so you can see in the BMW 650 here we have our upgraded leather Dash which is hand stitched which is very nice coming down here we have a full-size cup holder which is able to take this large drink from Wendy's we have our usual BMW joystick shifter our Drive controller and then if we go here to the center console uh you know we have our little storage cubby and then right here in the middle we have our iPhone dock now this one's specifically designed for the iPhone 4 docks right in there as you can see we also have our usual iPod cable which is over USB there now the one thing to note is you can't you can have another USB device plugged in but you can't use this BMW y cable with the little audio dock Jack there while you have your phone docked here now the reason for this of course is the BMW app so you can see right now my phone says it's connected to the car now once you have your iPhone dot you have access to your connected drive with BMW apps now if you want to know more about that just take a look at the 650i convertible video because uh we went in into that in depth over there won't take up any time here but what we do have is access to the multimedia options so if you go into the multimedia menu here we have external devices and we have plug-in which is new so we also have my iPhone up here which you'd also get if you plugged it in via USB because you can see my iPods up here my iPhone's here but it's this plug-in option that's new so we go to plugin and we activate and here what's interesting is we get iPod video out or iPhone video out so this interface here that you see in the center of the screen this is actually being generated by my iPhone and so we have access to our genius mixes um you know you can you can sort through your phone and your iPod just like you would on your phone so you can see playlists here um it has very similar look and feel to your iPhone if we continue scrolling down we get the letter selection there and you can go through now I'm not quite clear why you'd want this I actually found it to be less useful than the regular iPod interface for me because I don't care about accessing my genius list but also because if you use the steering wheel control here you actually can't see your playlist in the gauge cluster here which you can if you plug it in regularly via the USB cable you'd actually get a track listing there so if you use BMW's interface you get a few more features but you don't get access to the Nifty Graphics you know or the iPod video out but you do get improved functionality with the car foreign Beltline High dashboard and large center console really make a 6 series feel like a big car and it is actually quite a big car it's based really on a 5 Series 7 Series hybrid I mean it's neither one nor the other but it's also both as the 7 Series and 5 series share an awful lot of parts but that's a good thing for the six series The build quality is extremely high inside everything is exactly how you'd like it from the leather Dash to the wonderfully comfortable 24-way power seats so unless you like Corner carving in style the 6 series is probably not the ideal Mountain driving car for you instead it really is a comfortable Highway Cruiser because it is a GT at heart so to that end we have four suspension modes here we have comfort plus Comfort Sport and Sport Plus Sport Plus reduces the traction stability control behavior of the car and so I really haven't used that much honestly I don't want to run a hundred two thousand dollar car into a telephone pole BMW would be mad at me but out on the highway it actually is a very comfortable car now our model is also equipped with the four wheel active steering system which really helps the 6 Series be more Nimble in parking lots but does offer a kind of a strange feel when you're actually carving Corners in the six series I'm not quite sure whether it feels unnatural or natural or not it definitely feels different than the 6 Series without it I'm not quite sure also whether it actually improves the handling or not it's very difficult to tell in a subjective way but the system does really make your turning Circle quite a bit tighter in the parking lots and it makes a 6 series just about as Nimble as a 3 Series in many ways to park that's oscillated by our all-around parking system here and of course the self-paralleled parking system of the 6 Series has once again I'm Alex thanks at the juicybout cars.com and that's been our quick look at the BMW 650i check out the truth about cars.com for news reviews and of course the full review on the 650i coming soon thank you"

        "transcript": "All the painters that I knew when I was young,\nfor all of them, Matisse was a god; you know, he just had an astonishing impact on all painters\nin the second half of the twentieth century. In fact, I never thought about him as a man,\nand when I began to make enquiries, I came to realise what an extraordinary human being\nhe was.  Matisse was born in the very north-eastern side of France, just inside the border with\nBelgium. It's where the First World War was fought, in the thick of those terrible upheavals.\nThey were in his blood and in his bones; and of course, he grew up not to paint horror\nand destruction in the way that, say, Picasso did. Matisse wanted, in his work, a world\nof peace and harmony that he had never known. He sacrificed absolutely everything to his\nart. When his father said painting was crazy, he had to enrol at art school in secret. He\nran away at the age of 21 to Paris to become a painter, and everybody thought he was absolutely\nmad. He himself said that, you know, it would take 50 years, really, for people to understand.\nHe was trying to persuade himself that one day people would understand what he was doing.\nOf course, it was also very hard on his wife, who for a very long time was the only person\nin the world who really believed in him and his art, so it was not an easy life for any\nof them.  He made the first Icarus in 1943 what I think would be recognised as the\nfirst cut-out proper. France, of course, by now, was occupied, and Matisse was a bedridden\ninvalid, and when he cut that Icarus out, it was a time when shells were landing in\nhis garden, and Germans had commandeered the lower part of his house. He mounted it on\nblack and it's got what people thought were stars all around it, golden; actually, Matisse\nsaid they were exploding shells at the time. Of course, they were. Quite a lot of people\nwho visited Matisse did see him making these things, and described it. They were sheets\nof paper that had been covered with gouache colours. He sat up in bed against his pillows.\nHe'd pick up a piece and cut out the shape. His assistants, who had to paint the paper\nfor him, they had to pin it on the wall, because he hadn't the strength to do that any longer.\nHe'd say no, that won't do; shave a bit off there, cut a bit off there; and it went on\nfrom morning to evening. One of them said, he knew what he was looking for, but we didn't.\nIn his head, he must have had a picture of how it was he wanted it to end up, and it\nwas never like anything anybody else had ever made The Snail was a very late work, I think,\nand it's not even cut out; a lot of it is  actually torn paper He said what he was trying\nto do was boil down something, anything, to its essence without losing anything of expressiveness.\nHis whole life had been, one could say, a conflict between colour and line, and now\nhe'd abolished that conflict.  Matisse didn't really use words to express this; he expressed\nthese things with paint, but it is a kind of spiritual harmony and liberation and freedom\nthat he achieved at the very end of his life in his great cut paper compositions."

        "transcript": "hi there professor castro here and welcome to my youtube channel i received several emails inquiring about the different instruments that i use i decided to talk about each instrument each guitar in a series of web videos which i will file under the gear talk playlist on my youtube channel the first guitar i'll show you guys is this uh fender stratocaster it's i believe on either an 88 or an 89 made in japan 62 reissue i created a bc rich warlock for it the previous owner wanted something with a floyd rose i was looking for something a little bit tamer looks wise now i can honestly say that this guitar has been my constant companion throughout my guitar career today i've used it on pretty much all the recordings i've done back in the philippines and i've used it on conquest gigs for blues gigs this was my main axe for recordings if i needed a bluesy tone or if i needed really good clean sounds this is my go-to guitar now what makes this guitar special for me anyway is of the amount of views it's gotten it's also relic the proper way by playing the crap out of it all these crackles in the finish were acquired by roadware by playing it playing this guitar on stage in front of hundreds of people under hot lights and even hotter and very much humid uh philippines now despite the number of fears this guitar has been with me um it's really not heavily modified i kept the original vintage style tuners the bridge is original too the pickups the vintage style all niko emgs i think they're called svs or something sounds like a strat no hum so it's great the pickguard is fairly recent i got them from a company called q parts uh they make those skull knobs that you can see in the big ticket guitar stores here in the us now there's no fancy wiring modifications it's a straight strat setup you know so five-way switch tone knobs are wired to the neck and middle pickups um main reason for that is i like doing the hinges trick where you roll down the tone on the neck pick up you go for that pseudo y effect prior to relocating to los angeles in 2004 um i had to sell my guitars this guitar included to pay for the visa processing costs the guy i sold it to a good friend of mine jay he was in a touring cover band so for the next several years he played this guitar seven nights a week three or four sets a night that even put more mileage into this guitar a few years back i was vacationing in the philippines and he gave me a call and he asked if i wanted my guitar back and i said of course so i bought it back from him it just felt really really good to play this guitar again after getting it back from him um i took it back to the states i called up my good friend uh corey jordan of kojo guitar works these guys he's based out of joshua creek california and he's a really really good guitar cat i ship this guitar to him to give it the ones over make her sing again and the first thing that he told me was dude i haven't seen a guitar with this much use in my whole entire life you could actually gather dna samples because of all the crud that's accumulated over the years i never had it clean so there's my dna in there and then there's jay's dna and whoever else is dna one of the best things that corey did to this guitar is his refret job the original 62 reissue fretboard radius is 7.25 inches i think uh vintage radius and i like a fairly flat radius for the stuff i do since this guitar had two or three refrets done prior to this you didn't want to change the radius of the fretboard so what he did was he installed big tall frets and he radiused the threads and what that does is on the outer strings it feels almost scalloped because of the space between the string and the fretboard wood but towards the middle it feels a little flat it feels great i like it now going back to the tremolo for most of its life i've always played this guitar with the bridge flush against the body and i never used the the whammy bar because um one primarily it was a backup guitar so if i broke the string on one of my floyd rose equipped guitars i needed something that would uh be stable and if i broke a string on this guitar i didn't have to worry about a floating bridge going out of tune nowadays i'm using a floating uh setup for my tremolo i found a way of tweaking the vintage style tremolo to where it's very stable tuning wise regardless if i bend the pitch down or pull the pitch up and it doesn't need the locking tuners the roller nuts the nut juice or whatever other do that you need for a tuning stability as far as the setup goes what's involved is setting the bridge so that it pulls up a minor third on the third string a whole step on the second string and a half step on the first string now once you have that set up the springs in the back also require a little tweaking the treble spring is set up shorter than the base spring and the whole reasoning for this is because the base strings have more string tension you need to counteract that more with the spring behind it so this is a little more stretched out and this is a little more relaxed i just angle the spring cloth to get the tensions right and the result is perfectly stable vintage style trend i can still go back up to two well there you have it i hope you enjoyed this video i certainly enjoyed talking about my oldest friend right here if you're in the us and would like some guitar work done contact my buddy corey jordan of kojo guitar works so just search for kojo guitar works on facebook and he'll take care of you so until the next video peace love happiness good heavenly stuff you"

        "transcript": "hey everyone this is Kevin with divinely designed and I'm going to be doing a short video on using so calc to create a shaving soap so a couple people have asked me on my YouTube site and I was reading through Facebook the other day and somebody asked this question as well about how to use soap calc when creating a shaving soap because when you use a shape or when you create a shaving soap you're usually using some combination of both sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide so I'll be walking through that today now what this video is not is not the ultimate formula for the shaving soap right you will create that recipe what you think the most fantastic ingredients are for your shaving soap and in what proportions you use them I'm not telling you what the most fantastic recipe for a shaving soap is I have a recipe in here for demonstration purposes of using soap calc ok so let's get started when you go to soap calc it it's pretty easy to walk you through you can see there are numbers here and we'll walk through each of those steps on number one it will default to sodium hydroxide and that's what you're gonna leave it as right now we're gonna come back and we'll be using the potassium hydroxide one in a second but for right now you just leave it selected like it is and number two um I selected the ounces you can do this in however you want to create your recipe but let's say I want to make a three pound recipe so I'm gonna select 48 ounces of oils as my goal the water under number three it will default to water as a percent of oils of 38 and you can leave it just like this if you soap with a particular lye concentration you can certainly select that radio button and then just type in whatever like concentration you typically use for 4 you're gonna select your super fat it will default to 5 which is where I'm leaving it and you can also choose your fragrance amount if the 20.5 i believe i changed mine to 0.84 number five you don't need to do anything here you can just leave that alone number six is where you're going to enter your formula or your butters and your oils so here you can see I have a formula I have and I'm using a percentage formula you could also type in the specific number of ounces if you wanted to but for this demonstration video I'm using just my recipe and in terms of a percentage so my percentages need to total up to 100 to have a complete recipe so I have 50% beef tallow 20% stearic acid 10% castor oil 10% kokum butter 10% mango butter and once I have my whole recipe entered then I can come down to number 7 here and click on the calculate recipe button once I've done that you'll notice the button right below it becomes active or you can click on it and go ahead and click on that it will open up in a new screen or a new tab in your browser the recipe that you've created so here's all of my oils and everything and it will list it out in pounds and ounces and grams and above that is the water and lie so you can see we need 517 grams of water and 180 grams of lye in this case our sodium hydroxide so remember these numbers for now in fact if you're doing this in using soap calc you would write these numbers down so that you can remember them because we're gonna go back and calculate the potassium part right now so going back to soap calc I believe everything I've done exactly the same except I'm gonna come up here and choose potassium hydroxide I'm gonna then hit that calculate recipe button again and then click on the view or print recipe button now you can see my lye is my potassium hydroxide and now it calls for two hundred and fifty two point nine or and route up to 250 3 grams of potassium hydroxide now look that our grams of water are still the same 517 so that's the amount of water you're gonna use for this recipe is 517 grams of water but let's look at the amounts of the different types of lye that we're going to use okay now we have to do a little bit of math whoops pull this up so you can see okay so remember when we calculated for the sodium hydroxide it called for a hundred and eighty grams and when we calculated for the potassium it called for two hundred and fifty three grams now in both of those formulas we were using a hundred percent of each of those but what we want is a combination of sodium and potassium hydroxide now here on the bottom I've broken them out now I'm gonna use a ratio of forty percent sodium hydroxide to sixty percent potassium hydroxide now this ratio here is also something you need to figure out or you need to determine depending on your formula this ratio may vary for you depending on what you think the most perfect shaving soap is this ratio may vary for you but I'm using for this demonstration purposes forty percent sodium hydroxide and sixty percent potassium hydroxide you will change this to whatever you want it to be 80/20 70/30 65 35 whatever you think the perfect ratio is that's what you'd want to use so for my 40 percent sodium hydroxide I'm gonna take the total amount of 180 and multiply it by 0.4 to give me 72 grams and the 60 percent potassium I'm going to take the 253 and multiply it by 0.6 to get 150 1.8 or I'd round that up to 152 grams so remember our water amount was 517 grams of water we'd still use the hat to which I would add 72 grams of sodium hydroxide and 152 grams of potassium hydroxide and that's what I would add to my oils and butters to make the shaving soap now remember that this percentage is are these percentages over here must total 100% so no matter what the ratio is 80/20 60/40 70/30 you must total to 100% to make sure that your recipe is accurate okay that's really it there is another calculator out there and I will put links down below both to soap calc and this other my calculator which is called the summer belie calculator summer B actually allows you to choose the ratio of sodium and potassium but I'm not real familiar with that one I just don't have a comfort level of using it not that it's hard or anything but I'm just much more familiar with soap calc and I find this way very easy for me to understand you can put in that whole recipe run it for sodium write your values down and then just go back and click that potassium button and you get your other amounts a little bit of math and then you're all done so that's it comments questions leaving below I'll certainly try to answer any questions you guys have if you liked this video click that thumbs up button and if you're new to my channel click on that subscription button

        "transcript": "[Music] what is going on guys welcome back to another cartoon conspiracy as always with your host kmac time now I've already got a theory on this and I thought it was really good but I thought this theory is really cool too so I thought I would share with you guys so because I'm not seeing that first year I did in this I'll leave a link in the description and I'll leave an annotation in the video go check that theory out as well but let's go ahead and jump right into this cartoon conspiracy theory about Foster Home for Imaginary Friends now I know I say this about every cartoon it seems like this was a really cool cartoon I'll enjoy this cartoon as a kid both of what the theory argues is that Frankie who was the redheaded one our third gun familiar is Madame is a younger version of Madame Foster who was the old lady right there and basically the theory goes on to argue that Madame Foster imagined Frankie to be a younger version of herself to take over the house once she is too old to take care of herself she cares deeply about the imaginary friends in the house which cares deeply about their well being and she does that herself being so old will not be able to take care of it by herself for very much longer hence why she imagined herself a younger version of herself to take care of the in the future so Frankie is not a real person she is an imaginary character just like blue just like wilt or any of the other characters in the house she is imaginary and there's some pretty cool evidence for that as well and one of the strongest points of the theory is that Frankie never has any imaginary friends of her own nor does the show allude to any possibility of her making up her own imaginary friend now one potential counter-argument is this is as an episode where Frankie goes on a date with an actual human being and that could be you know kind of misconstrued a little bit but the facts are that she may be unaware that she's imaginary or what I like to consider is that she just likes humans you know there's several incidents in this show where you know imaginary friends have crushes on actual humans so this could just be another instance of that making this an invalid counter-argument to the theory and that's what I believe is going on here another important thing to point out is this would explain why Frankie is willing to work at the foster home instead of going on to college or pursuing a career here she's stuck here because Madame Foster created her and because of that she never does anything else doesn't really hang out with any other Hugh are human friends he doesn't really have a job right outside of this you didn't have any kind of dreams outside of this she's kind of just stuck in this endless loop of taking care of this home because that is what she was created to do again a very interesting theory but wait there's more there's a flipside to this theory that may discredit this this theory but have a different theory all entirely and it all is based around this next picture which you guys are going to see which is Frankie's driver's license might be wondering why would an imaginary friend need a driver's license she must in fact be a human well that comes to the do you think that's true which some people may have some people may not it brings up this interesting theory it's a different theory is that that Madame Foster is imaginary it's not too far-fetched to believe that that Madame Foster could have passed away due to old age and Frankie who was totally heartbroken may have imagined an imaginary Madame foster to prevent anyone from finding out that she was actually dead it explained why Madame foster is so childlike and energetic you know why she's always doing these crazy things he's always jumping on the back of things he's always playing games she's a very energetic and seemingly too energetic for her old age that would be because she's an imaginary version of the real Madame foster who is actually deceased this again would explain why Frankie cannot move on with her life you know go to college good job she's obsessed with the death of her grandmother she may want to make sure that no one knows that her grandmother's actually dead so she has to stay in the house for the foster care for all these imaginary friends and she has to take care of it that's why she never goes on to pursue any of our other dreams so you know there's a very cool flipside to each city or you know which one I believe I'm not not personally weighed towards either one I think they're both both very plausible very cool very very different insights on this let me know what you guys think down in the comment section whether if it leave a comment telling me if you think Frankie's real or if you think Madame Foster's real I'd love to see you guys opinion on this you know I'll maybe make a pull and see which side wins in the comment section but that's all we have time for this time Gay guys I hope you guys enjoyed this theory you guys could load and leave this theory like it'd be very very much appreciated as always if we hit that 500 like mark before the end of the weekend we will drop out next week's theory a day early that's why I went ahead and made this one for you guys a couple days early just because you guys have been killing on that lately honor get throw you guys

        "transcript": "[Applause] what's up everyone this cybernet 8610 and today we're going to have a trade binder update and playmat update so first playmats and see here the first three playmats I'm mainly looking to sell you can see uh those three those are mainly looking uh mainly looking to sell those and then after that these are like for trade or so we got Naruto it's kind of hard to see the whole play mats and all go the world championship one with insector there dragons Collide this is actual mat too not like paper or anything and uh two battle spirit ones all right let's just all right and now it's time to get to the main binder all right go and get this part off of it and there we go all right once list will be in the description and all uh sometimes I try for stuff that's not my want so you can go ahead and offer I remember to offer when you send me a trade and remember to keep reminding me of the offer because I wish YouTube would show like the whole conversation that way I could see the whole trade the whole time but yeah so just have to keep reminding me on the offer sometimes I trade for other stuff too other card games and stuff too just go ahead and offer on that sometimes I'm out for Pokemon or a card fight uh even traded you know for like Digi VI and stuff too like older stuff like that even like the old Power Ranger morphers and stuff you know just cuz I like some of that older stuff just the collect uh let's see uh blue eyes white dragon that's ghost so yeah if you don't know what a card is of course just uh ask me in the uh comments and if you want to trade don't leave that in the comments if you want to trade you have to send me a message the new uh YouTube layout I know is a little weird but uh just I think you have to go to the about section on my channel and then after that it should have uh the send message I believe button on that I might also have more than one of a certain card just asked sometimes I put the card side by side like for example like the kaas like that but then sometimes I actually put them in the same sleeve so you never know so just go ahead and ask if you need more than one of a certain card and yeah I mean uh once L I always update and stuff I get a lot of offers so yeah remember that I get a lot of offers and stuff so I might not be able to answer like right away sometimes it takes a little bit but I will try to get through the messages and get back to you as soon as I can cuz after I do my these I swear I get like maybe at least 150 messages so yeah it's it's pretty hard to go through all those and you know and still work on my usual job and stuff so it's kind of like really crazy but I promise I will try to get back to you as soon as possible uh let's see these are from Legendary Collection all right so yeah like I said any questions everything should be near Min mint you know stuff like that synchros uh this this is the Majestic Red Dragon Ghost and this is the black BL Dragon Ghost also have our ocg boundary after this trying to think of anything else that I need to go over on that uh heral of perfection ghost like I said just go ahead and make offers if you don't have anything for my wants might be able to still work out a trade then uh let's see uh number C32 shark Drake Vice you know as that ghost one and uh I might not be able to look through your trade binder too that's why I say offers and not so much you know send me your binder video because yeah it's it takes a while to look through a bunch of binder videos so I might not be able to watch the binder videos on values don't ask me on values please uh just go to eBay and I value it around the eBay price not trolling toad eBay price trolling Toad's a little weird on a lot their prices so I don't go by them I know a lot of people do for some weird reason but I don't agree with a lot of their prices like eBay is the most accurate dual terminal so yeah U try to think there's anything else cuz I know I'm going to like there's something I'm missing on I need to say in this video oh yeah I do uh trade with anyone doesn't matter what country or whatever so that's one thing for that go have a little bit of glare like I said on the first three playmats though I'm mainly looking to sell and on the other ones I I do trade for playmats too so if you have a playmat or whatever still offer those sometimes I might even trade for like video games or something too you know like Game Boy games like the old Pokemon games and stuff Game Boy Color Advance all those you know even the DS ones trade for a lot of random stuff so there should be a lot of different options right and here's the last page of the traps we have lots of breakthrough skill see yep there's that and then we'll go to the ocg binder which these are the Japanese cards all these are Japanese so if you want to trade just uh send me a message on these as well right turn the page there we go elemental dragons got two of them at least I can't stress enough that to send messages if you uh leave a trade offer in a comment I probably won't be able to get back to you just because I get you know a lot of comments and it I don't like to do trade deals in comments I mean it's just too hard to keep track of have a lot of magic magic magician gals too if anybody wants some of those somehow I got a bunch of those guess it was through a trade or something all these are Japanese remember that and yeah that is I mean here's some like random cards if you guys want to see I like one Naruto card then let's see we have the these random cards I don't know what they are I think they're wife shorts or something like that and uh so yeah I have been looking for a lot of these the Dual ter uh D terminal uh detector cards from uh Digimon so if anybody has any those I main looking for those they're kind of that style where they have like either they silver or gold or like the spirit Digimon I'm really looking for those and we have some bleach cards yeah this binder is a little random to say the least so y that is the two binders hopefully the video W too fast if you needed to of course you can pause throughout the video and yeah remember just send offers through messages all right so yeah uh if you have any questions you can also uh leave that in the comments or send me a message if you couldn't tell what a card was or whatever and uh yeah I think that's everything and yeah that I will try to get back to you guys as soon as possible remember that like I said I get a lot of messages and I think that's everything all right so yeah remember to comment rate and subscribe thank you for watching and I'll catch you guys later see you [Music]"

        "transcript": "this is going to be a review of my 2007 kazaki Vulcan 900 on YouTube there were a few videos of reviews but most of them were from people who just recently bought their motorcycle so I decided to give a brief review on my motorcycle after riding over 27,000 miles on her as you can see it's a kavasaki Vulcan 900 with some added features first off I added these two dual electric horns in the front they are pretty loud they just sound almost like a car horn in addition I just added these Pia 1100x 55 watt bulbs however they have an output of 85 Watts which is pretty bright in front I also have the kavaki light bar which I just replaced the um light bar beams with the p ones addition I added these short risers which brings the whole handlebars closer to the rider however the cables are a little bit short so I had to do a little adjustments to pull some slack out of the cables to get enough slack I also added these mirrors not sure what brand they are they look great however I don't like them as that you need an allen wrench as can see here to adjust them so you have to adjust them prior to riding which sometimes can be a hassle I also added these kaken isog grips which significantly decrease the vibration especially on Long rides I also added these kak and floorboards and the kak and highway pegs however for spending over $100 on these highway pegs as you can see the quality is pretty bad but they do their job now in addition for my long rides I really found this Mustang seat with a back rest to be crucial to surviving long trips on the road um average I'd say about 14 to 18 hour days on my motorcycle it definitely helps I also added this luggage rack where I can put my travel bag and increase the capacity of the saddle bags now note on the saddle bags they do look kind of big from the outside however you can only fit about a 12pack of soda or a 1gallon gas can in them now also I added these Cobra Speedster long exhaust pipes which sound great and my opinion look great as well in addition to the isog grips I also added a um throttle boss which helps releve strain on your hands on um long trips now most of this was fairly easy to mount I would say the most difficult ones were the pl lights and the electrical horns just because you need to know some basic information about wiring and things like that other than that I am greatly satisfied with my motorcycle the Mustang seat does not necessarily lower your riding position it is a lot more comfortable than the stock one and certainly the back breust helps out a lot as I mentioned before the iso grips really help um decreasing vibrations to your hands after long rides with the stock handle uh with stock grips my hands would usually tingle and be almost a little bit numb but with these grips I have no complaints whatsoever now this is how my my horn [Music] sounds and this is these are my coverra exhaust [Music] pipes now on that note the Vulcan 900 is a great motorcycle for longdistance riding it is not a typical long-distance motorcycle which I've noticed on um my trips however the 900c engine does help and it is a little bit low on the power however if you just Cruise along at 70 75 M an hour it is a comfortable ride um personally I would like a little bit more power however for long trips it doesn't really matter as as much on this motorcycle I actually put on um Metzler tires which are technically only rated for about 9,000 miles however on these set of tires I've done over almost 16,000 miles and they're still good so if you have any questions about how to mount any of this or my satisfaction with certain products let me know and I'm glad to help you"

        "transcript": "hey youtube uh kinda got a crazy uh coincidence i guess but i actually played fyc rider his uh xbox live name is ryan2df uh i got to play his able a couple times and his adon really i think he beat me all together i think like three eight or three seven maybe even more maybe three nine uh but he just kept joining and uh like if you see i'll show you from right here like i had seventeen what is that seventeen seventy thousand five hundred twenty seven forty fourth down four thousand seven hundred ten you know player points so i was doing really well like i was beating everybody and then by the end of our set i had four 4 302 player points and 17 160 battle points but uh i don't mind losing to better players and i definitely don't mind the experience as well especially this was the final so actually didn't winning one of them before this one but yeah so i'm gonna show you some of the able matches the eight on matches i don't really know the match up that well but if you guys do want to save them or see them let me know in the comments and i will save these and we will watch them but to be honest i can't give you anything constructive just because i don't know what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] i'm doing like when it came down to it really i just couldn't tech and like you put me in like constant 50 50. so it's either i like i attack or try to tag or i'd get like dp'ed or he wouldn't dp and i thought he was gonna dp so he grabbed me so those were quite frustrating but um if you guys want to see those definitely let me know and i'll cast those too but i definitely want to show these just because i mean he's one of i think top three you know ables in the u.s i mean he's finished strong in every tournament i think he's placed in so mad shout out to him and uh i'm gonna go over some of the things that i think i did right but mostly it's gonna be what i did wrong because i don't know most of the time i was just outplayed all right i actually don't remember all this so ah miss commodore is not good good spacing for me though in this matchup let me say this in this matchup um especially against really good ables that understand spacing it's very hard to attack them i noticed uh it's better to kind of keep your space and make them come to you type of thing because you can actually like i know i don't play him that way but raju is actually a a zoning character so he doesn't have to come up to you to win he can meet you from afar and that's one of the things that i'm trying to learn how to play well is like i i'm pretty good i feel as if i have good footsies and you know i i i feel as if i utilize his in-game but his out game i think i'm lacking in so it's something i definitely need to work on but in this matchup i tried to do my best because there was no way i'd really be able to contend with his type of footsies you know because abel's normals are just so much better than i use it they should completely shut down his mid kick so what i try to do is just kind of keep him at bay at a distance and try to take advantage of uh his knockdown stuff he doesn't have a lot of wake up options other than roll so anyways here we go see there i'm just trying to run away try to say mid kick distance but really i'm just trying to utilize my fireball as much as possible but obviously it's not working that well so all right good tech from him i don't know why i did that that's another thing no fierces no fierces in this matchup no standing roundhouses you might get away with a standing uh fierce punch definitely don't do roundhouse i don't know what i was thinking there but don't do that ever in this matchup uh i don't think focusing as much is a very good idea either just because all his normals are in and they don't have a lot of delay so all his lights and stuff have really good recovery so you're not gonna like catch them i mean i guess you could but it's not very likely i wouldn't recommend doing focuses in this matchup but here we go good cross-up from him miss combo good tech for me i should have dp there though i had nothing to lose hey i'm trying to utilize that mid-kick firewall again there's that standing round there's that crouching roundhouse don't ever do a roundhouse in this matchup ever you're gonna see me do it consistent like consistently but after this i knew not to do it anymore but don't do that ooh good rod i was [\u00a0__\u00a0] sexy that was really nice so he did a crossover overhead standing and then he did about another overhead so that was really really nice from him really really good stuff i mean right when i saw that i was like holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] i'm in trouble i was kind of expecting to grab there so good uh okay there's another thing uh players don't like like you would think uh let me rephrase that i should be option selecting so i should have dp there um like he came in he back dash if i would have dp'd he would have got dp'd and i got another weight down but he said he back dash i didn't think he was going to do it just because he's a high level player but he doesn't know if i can do it if i if i know you know save jumps or if i know options likes and stuff so he's like you know i'm going to test it i didn't do it as a result i'm probably going to lose uh you know a 9th or 10th so this is another thing you really gotta you gotta implement what you know it on every basis uh good comment for me here see now oh i missed it there but you see now after i did that i'm making him respect it who is gonna hurt [\u00a0__\u00a0] oh good thing he missed that oh i should have canceled there could have been the game or the round i should say i got it anyways i don't really remember this so but good round for me there after i did that i was like i can at least i can content type of thing you know i mean like i can do this so it was a little it was definitely boost my confidence liz and maybe i'm not so outclassed as i think i am but the next round might i think proven differently i thought he's gonna mash out grab there see me implementing my option selects good roll from him i don't mind wasting the ex throwing fireball there because he was going to focus there there see i'm not trying to attack him at all i'm trying to make him come to me good block string for me but really good defense from him trying to try to make him match out so see don't focus see what i mean see what just happened to me there because of one focus that's why i'm saying don't do it because there's no reason for you to do it all his his his normals and lights recover too fast for you really even utilize it so i would definitely not recommend it i mean i just lost i think almost you know a quarter of my life now he has wake up options and i have to get out of this i'm in like the worst position i could have been in i had the advantage now i'm screwed kind of oh i didn't i didn't d wake up dp or anything crazy thank god otherwise you would got a free ultra ooh that was a dp ooh that was a dp oh nice nice for me and him respecting there ah nice for me really nice for me oh my god i don't know what happens oh that's right okay and that's what makes the difference between a pro player and a player that plays on xbox live live he knew i didn't have a safe jump also he knew that i couldn't option select so it wasn't a safe jump so as a result right when i jumped in it was his match i let my emotions and my uh you know my my adrenaline get the best of me but really i knew that that wasn't a safe jump i knew that i had no business doing it and as a result you know i lost so really good you know heads up play from him and really bad understanding the knowledge of the the matchup from me but that's the first one we got three more coming up"

        "transcript": "I'm Annabelle Carmel and I'm going to be making for you a very popular recipe from my book The Complete baby in toddler meal planner now when you start cooking for your baby you might think about making apple or pear or banana maybe carrot puree you may not think about lentils lentils are delicious they're rich in protein they're rich in iron and babies love them so the first thing I'm going to do is just pop this on and add some sunflower oil and heat that up now you can bring your baby up as a vegetarian it's fine the only thing is you have to worry about how much iron your baby is going to have because from 6 months they have used all the iron that they've inherited from you and they need to get iron from their diet and breast milk or formula milk isn't a particularly good source of iron so that's why lentils are such a good puree for your baby so I'm going to add onion some chopped onion and some chopped carrot and some chopped celery and cook that up for about 5 minutes so these are my red lentils when you bring your baby up as a vegetarian it's not the same as an adult vegetarian diet because and I vegetation D is quite bulky lots of whole grains or brown rice whereas the vegetarian diet for babies needs to be more nutrient dense so what you're going to need to do is you need to include some cheese or eggs in the diet as well cuz babies only have small tummies and the other thing is that although this is really high in iron it's quite difficult for our bodies to absorb it it's not like meat so in order to boost the iron absorption of something like lentils you need to give your baby some vitamin C at the same meal so maybe a diluted fruit juice which in vitamin C or it could be something like some strawberries or some kiwi at the end the meal for dessert let's get that stir just need to C that till it's tender there we are so there's my onion carrot and celery nicely softened and now I'm going to add my lentils and some peeled and chopped sweet potato babies love root vegetables like this and also they're very good for you cuz they're rich in Bea carotene which is the vegetable form of vitamin A just stir that together and now you're going to add some vegetable stock unsalted vegetable stock pour that in so all you need to do now is cover it and leave it to simmer for about 20 minutes lentils tend to soak up lots of liquid so it should be a really nice texture once it's done right let's have a look that's about 20 minutes see nice and thick soaked up all those lovely flavors all those lovely root vegetables in there so what we need to do now is pure it it in here so this is one of two lentil purries in my book there's another one which is very tasty and it has Pat in it and some grated cheese very yummy in fact this one is so good you could actually pure it add some extra stock and seasoning and make it into a soup for the family okay there we go that's a real nice consistency see like that you don't want it too thin or it slops off the spoon so that's perfect for your baby and you don't really want lumps in it because at this age if you're going to give it sort of quite early on sort of 6 months they really don't like lumpy food um so let's have a try that tastes very good pop it into my bowl and again this is perfect for freezing so you've got probably about four portions there for your baby and as I said makes a delicious soup for the whole family so don't forget to try lentils for your baby excellent source of iron protein very quick to cook and they taste delicious"

tonight and it's exciting so um I kind of got all spiffied up not really like over the top or anything um but something that I can feel like I look cute in but also be comfortable so I'll show you my outfit um quickly I'm gonna go through my makeup and everything so obviously you guys can tell I um straightened my hair and I actually just recently recolored it so yeah it looks much better than it did um but as far as hair accessories um the only thing I did is I just pulled over a little section of like bangs or whatever and I Bobby pinned them and then I just stuck this little black flower in my hair which I really love and I never really get to wear this flower so thumbs up for that um next for makeup the only eyeshadow that I have on um is this big color eye pencil from Avon and it's in the color chocolate brown right yeah it's in the color chocolate and what I did was I just um I put on Urban Decay primer potion because this is a cream color um Shadow so I put on that and then what I did was I put it all over my eye and I used my finger and I darkened it up just along the outside like Corners just to kind of make it look like there's two colors on there but I just wanted something really natural but you know I still want it to look like there was eyeshadow on and yes brown and black can be worn together as long as you do it in the right way um eyeliner I have on if I can find it there it is it's all right um eyeliner I just have on this wet and wild um color icon black just regular pencil eyeliner and I lined there's like a really small just kind of wing out there I line my waterline and then I also lined really really thinly my top lash line um and then I did apply some false lashes because I didn't want to put any mascara on so you guys can see there's what the false lashes look like these are a pair of lashes from Sonia kashuk um I have no idea what the like name of them is I don't know what number they are um but they come in a little container like this looks like this and they come with glue um but I used the Revlon Lash Precision oh sorry sorry I use this the Lash Precision lash adhesive which I really like because it goes on the lashes blue and then when it starts to get tacky it turns like clearish white so yeah those are my lashes and then on my lips I have on two things oh sorry I'm like shaking you guys to death um I have on my bite lip Rouge in the colored geranium and it looks like this can you guys see that kind of a really pretty bubble gum pink and then over top of that I have on I'm sorry one oh hot dog um revline one of their color burst lipsticks this is one of the newer colors and this is the color Pink Sugar and it's just a really light pink with sparkles and I don't have on any glass so for accessories I have on this kind of um fake fashion ring just kind of simple sparkly then I have on my diamonds and then I have on my um Geneva watch that I got from Charming Charlie and I did do a review on that store if you guys are interested I did it a long time ago it's an old video but there's my watch I love it it's got the rhinestones and I don't have a necklace or earrings on um I don't know I didn't want to have the force earrings through it's just because I don't wear them very often and I don't know I never really wear necklaces plus I just kind of wanted to leave the dress dark I don't really want anything to offset it and I felt like a watch would look kind of funny with a necklace so I chose a watch over a necklace um so I'm going to show you my entire outfit now these are black wedges from Gap and yes sad but true my aunt's dog when I first moved down here chewed this one just the end of the buckle but yeah they're just these black wedges with a little Silver Buckle on them I love these things I hardly ever get to wear them they're really really comfortable so yeah I like them and they go really cute with this dress so I'm going to back up and show you my entire outfit now so here is my outfit as you can see it is kind of a um tear style dress so you can see there's like a tear here and then another tier here and then the bottom um it's kind of flowy so yeah it's just a really plain simple black dress um just kind of dressing it up with my watch and then you know a couple rings nothing really fancy um you know my hair with the flower so it's really really simple um with the shoes I guess let's do it this way with the shoes the wedges um just kind of make it I don't know a little like more dressy but also the same and Casual I feel like um wedges are more casual than heels sometimes so yeah this is my outfit of the night so yeah all right guys so that was my outfit I hope you guys enjoy let me know what you think um if you like seeing these videos let me know I

a creeper sejuani is right there to cut him off forcing him to juke back up the lane as the clip continues Leeson keeps running away but sejuani stays right on him as he loops back around and makes a break for his base but several enemy players catch up to him they overshoot it as he turns back for the second time in this lena said she wanted charges right at him but he gets close enough to the creeps jumping out with resonating strike and then proceeds to work his way through the jungle having escaped the majority of the enemy team with a kill under his belt and for a number one Pro play for this week we have Tadzio 43 on Vayne and I know we've had a lot of Vayne plays lately but this one focuses more than the teamwork aspect of things and the impressive synergy between the two when Vayne overextends a bit too far the enemy team jumps in with nunu landing the snowball exhaust goes out as amumu quickly moves into position to land the bandage toss but she quickly reacts with a sidestep - dodges Janna turns around and Q's up an amazing tornado that hits all three players as Vayne sits on amumu and the FAR's do condemn knocking them into the walls they secure the kill with no barrier up they both get on as Rios vain tries their best to stay away from nunu while killing us reeling the amazing exhaust allows just that as s goes down the Janna shield keeps Bane alive she tosses out another great sword a dough but nunu flashes and we freeze it so you can see the exact moment where she breaks on a side stopping his attack with that they secure the three four zero exchange and a perfect synergy played between ADC and support and four the Boscombe of the week we've hobo Harry on chogath with a perfectly timed rupture to save his life and scoop up the double kill as the club plays I just wanted to say a few things first off we're in the process of working on our next team play episode and we're shooting for a release by the end of this month lastly if you haven't already check out Razer comps and give it a try it's an amazing VoIP software like teamspeak and it's completely free so be sure to check it out and see how you like it there will be a link in the description box down below thanks everyone for watching I hope you liked this episode I'll see you back here soon for the next episode of our league of legends top 5 plays"

        "transcript": "what's up max nation it's boys floyd maximus entertainment worldwide coming to you with the top teams that we are going to be using in madden 16 next year now we don't like to use those high 90 teams like the seahawks like the past that's just lame we like to go and find sleeper teams now we're going to use to whoop on the pads and put all the seahawks let's go this may be a surprise but that miami dolphins are actually going to be very good this they got a few impact new additions they got my boy don't you call sue going out there sacking QBs on defense also we got Jimmy Cameron at tight end puts them at a premier spot with a top ten tight end in the league they also got my boy kenny stills from New Orleans to give Tannehill a new target to throw do and also the old man but mr. for reliable Greg Jennings as well as Jarvis Lynch they got a very solid receiving corps Devante Parker basedgod Louisville is coming in about to give them filthy office with Ryan Tannehill now on defense they got Cameron Wake they got Nick domick on Donkey Kong su and they got bread crimes for the best corners in the league the line back in court this isn't too bad but they got gillette e Jenkins so the linebacker coin great but overall the x factor on this team is ryan tannehill mobility dude you can roll left you can roll right is going to be a very good quarterback you can also scramble since a lot of people don't like to use Cuban spies you'll be able to get first downs constantly if they're in zone or a man you'll be able to scramble with them and make other teams go crazy coming in at number four is a team that made a ton of splashes this offseason their j-e-t-s jets judge judge baby girl now we're gonna start with quarterback we love having mobile quarterbacks Geno Smith not that bad has a mobile quarterback and he's got new additions Brandon Marshall a 65 wide receiver out of Central Florida they got Decker they got Chris Ivory a bruiser of a tailback but let me tell you Revis and cromarty two of the top corners from but last year man this defense is insane now there x factor is that 17 they are the best in the NFL possibly they got the number one draft pick Leonard Williams Muhammad Wilkerson and Sheldon Richardson already two of the top three four defensive ends in the league now Damon Harrison Demario Davis those guys had 90s muck cards so this defense is just loaded top to bottom now coming in at number three is Minnesota Vikings kind of a surprise here but I think they're gonna be nasty to use madden 16 now let me tell you why they have a pretty solid oline and they got a mobile quarterback probably the best mobile quarterback on this list and Teddy Bridgewater now ladies and gentlemen let me tell you about this defense Anthony Barr Jerry Floyd Everson Griffen brian robertson save your rose Harrison Smith the list goes on and top corner of the draft trae Waynes now the x factor is going to be the development of the second and third near players starting with Teddy Bridgewater and then moving on to roads and Anthony Barr those two defensive players have stunt characteristics and if it pans out correctly in the madam ratings the Minnesota Vikings are going to be the team to use baby girl oh yeah almost forgot ap he's kind of good America and international nations let me tell you about our number-2 team the Kansas City Chiefs now why do I want to use them it's because of their new wide receiving corps Travis Kelce a speed tight end and they're voted back field of Jimmy Charles that black mamba Thomas and Niles Davis new additions Jeremy Maclin one of my favorite receivers to use last year in franchise mode look for him to have awesome stats in madden 16 don't forget about Marcus Peters supposedly the number one quarterback in the trap but he had some character issues that's why I fell behind trae Waynes he chokes people out he strangles at my woman bring some more ferocity to that nasty defense with tom hollie Tara Johnson Eric Berry if we can make it back Sean Smith tall corner dr. a PO Justin Houston don't forget about that man eat bad and our number one team it's got to be the Buffalo Bills they got the bad boy EJ Manuel at quarterback this guy got his license to sling ladies and gentlemen he's throwing the ball to Sammy Watkins the new addition the underrated no one could stand him Percy Harvin been on about five teams in five years before he can play the game Charles clay from Miami got a solid receiving corps and who can't forget shady McCoy they treated he koans of the shade McCoy Chip Kelly what are you thinking give away one of the best running backs in the league oh I won't take it Rex Ryan is gonna have a field day with shady McCoy running back he's going to go to the ground and pound and also eat a lot of good snaps on defense they got the best offensive line of football with Mario Williams Marcell Dareus Kyle Williams and Jerry Hughes their front four are ridiculous and also loads those quarterbacks will cause many headaches for opposing quarterbacks Yodas McElveen Stephon Gilmore Corey Graham in pocari Rambo absolute beast the x factor of the team is definitely Percy Harvin he's going to be a fast receiver very elusive and also going to be one of the best returners in the game these are our top five teams to use madden 16 and remember we like to use a team with a mobile quarterback and a very solid defense agree/disagree leave a comment below and also your surprise team of the year thank you for watching and we are out from floyd maximus you"

milestone but um it's been about 3 months and 2 days since I've shaved it first about at least 3 months as I shaved it back in November but um I'm pretty happy about it um at the how fast it's growing it's quite about 3 inches to about 2 3 inches so that's pretty good for 3 months I guess I don't want you to fight every day because you know washing your hair every day is bad for your hair but yeah

blonde and you use this off silver it helps to gradually lighten your hair even more so I've been using that mixed with regular shampoo I don't have a color protect because I had a lot when I colored my hair and I just never finished it all so I've been mixing those kind of shampoos and I think it's helping the blonde to come out which is awesome but I haven't died that or bleached it or anything as much as I wanted to I wanted to bleach it out so bad like I want to bleach it out and tie a blue because blue at this link would look pretty awesome or just oh you know red ethically like a really dark red it's a really really nice thing but I'm not buying it which is bad because I really want but for loss of love which is not understand the reason that I shaved mine in the first place that I haven't I'm not dying my hair do you have a hat in the background which is why my hair is laying so flat so nicely because normally it pushed up a lot in the back but I've been wearing a hat like the past day or two now like all day so I'm wearing it must be on an angle because I don't like it's not comfortable for me to wear a hat like this it's just not a square I like at a slight angle so I'm wearing a hat and so catch my hair he know nice and smushed down so high hair sure why but it helps cuz I like it a lot but I like it a lot better like that but um I'm I was show going to show how about how happy with my hair being I would like to get back down to my waist or about you know right around here because it hasn't been that long and over six years about to see I guess since its grade is when I had my hair that long so I'm just going to show you how long I would be tolerable of it being before I cut it but I really don't want to let it get this long and then cut it because it'll go right back to being a really really short and although I do look nice we're short here I can pull it off I missed my long hair I really really do um so I regret shaving my head no but I do miss long hair I'm very much looking forward to it being you know either way or something so I can maybe cut it into my style I'm still debating I'm just letting it grow up completely naturally and not cutting it at any and just letting it grow and grow and grow and grow to its natural you know all natural you know like when a baby before they get their haircut for the first time it's just how the hair naturally grows on I'm thinking about doing that um yeah but how long my hair like the longest my hair has been in the past couple in a long long time since I you know since I had it down to about my waist was my senior year and it was about that long I don't know if you can see how long that is or not but it was long or this one it was all rather than this in this picture but that's the long term I has really been in like six years because I've kept cutting it look i-i've married on length like I had that about this long at one point my junior year and then it was a little bit longer on the other side so it kind of grew in angular say that I think it was about this long on the sides and then over here on the side I was like done here but it was pretty it was like purple and orange it looked really good I liked it but yeah so that's that's what it's about like I said about two-three inches I've been measuring it from growing grabbing like right about here lifting it up and then put my hand up and guessing about this high off that's about two three inches to me but yeah that's all this video is for yeah I finally showed blonde I'm so happy I shovel on my hair straight out about three inches in three months that's about an inch a month hopefully it'll keep up with that like at that speed of growing so I don't summertime it'll be about to my chin hopefully I would like it to be about you know at least the bottom my ears by March I'd be happy with to be in that long round March which it should be because it's February oh no April about April it should be about my lobes which I'd be happy with and speaking up I have taken my gauges out and I haven't really kept up with keeping a mouth on me I guess for me gay that it is really were just a phase because I had many years almost at 7:16 they were a double dears I don't think they'll ever well they could completely close up i duplicated it in once a while just to keep it from totally closing but they're small now probably at a four but yeah that's that's just my overall update yeah any questions or anything just let me know and I will respond so here three months we go I look like a boy but a pity boy okay that's good guys bye"

        "transcript": "I was highly skeptical because coming from a city background where if something's too good to be true it normally is I was looking for the catch but I looked at it up and down inside out every which way and I just couldn't find anything wrong and I suddenly thought this is an incredible concept I spent 20 years in the textile industry as a director of various different companies and had what they called a great job and I really enjoyed my job except that I had absolutely no time when we went along to have a look at the presentation actually I only went along to make sure that Jeff wouldn't do it seeing the presentation getting involved is not me thinking maybe I don't want to be doing this forever maybe there is another way of earning a very good living and having time to enjoy things as well I originally started working in the city as a futures and options broker which was great financially but it was very long hours very stressful very competitive so at the end of seven years I decided to reduce my stress by setting up my own business which promptly went bust two years later and I lost everything and that was a very low point for me not just financially but also in terms of self-confidence my life was my my work that was really all there was and I reached that certain age and thought there's got to be more to life I kept joining gyms but I never never got there and ever had time to go that was the trouble and it's just so many more things in life that I wanted to do I found run it running a business of traditional business but in the end i was working more and more hours to make to make the same money my background was in catering i'm qualified chef and then i went on to do a job in telecoms and then while i was in that i fell pregnant and i became a full-time mum I wanted to earn money because I think I'm quite independent myself anyway but I couldn't see any other way that i could earn money without someone else having to look after Beth when we joined the business we were living in rather manky rented accommodation out of necessity that's what we had to do and now we live in a beautiful country home with four acres of land which is lovely to my home and it's a dream home I've educated my kids and that was my goal I wanted the children to go to top public schools and that was my goal and the day that I got the boys into those schools was one of the proudest days of my life I have about three months holiday every year and a month of which this year was paid for by forever living with spending money i get i have three young children so it means i can spend a lot of time with my kids which most working fathers can't do basically perhaps can snatch a kiss with him first thing in the morning and then they see them when i get home late at night I feel blessed if you really want to know I feel as if my life could vary slightly get better but you couldn't really have a much better life than i'm living at the moment i can in myself I feel much better I have so much more confidence now I feel so much more positive I really feel I'm making a contribution it's not the money it's the pride of standing back and saying I have had a part to play in that person security I have had a part to play in building a team I wouldn't be where I am today unless people in my team were being successful your group your people the people you work with become almost like an extended family I know that might sound a bit corny but I'm helping people to develop their lives and to get what they want from life financially and lifestyle wise and I'm also helping people with these amazing products here we found a company it was bringing together two vital components product and company with a vision the people we're working with right now have also got a very very good future and yeah we sleep very well at night now I think the most extraordinary thing forever living is that you have some someone or some people holding your hand every step of the way when I first saw this business I wasn't sure that I could do it and I believe the business worked because I could see other people I've met other people that had got a great life so it obviously did work for some people but would it work for me and the biggest thing for me once I've seen the vision and I could see freedom flashing in front of my eyes was the fact that somebody was going to hold my hand and help me achieve now eight years on the reason that I am excited now as I was then is because of the training and support structure that the company have in place which i believe is second to none somebody can get involved in this business tomorrow and by the end of the week have an understanding of exactly what they need to do in order to be successful and every step of the way they are supported either by the company by people in their area by the person who introduced them into the business anybody can do it it's an absolutely equal playing field and it doesn't matter whether you start today I used to darted five years ago there's enough reward for everyone in the pot after four years we're living the dream that we set off and we saw other people doing when we first looked at it there's nothing special about me the only difference between me and some be looking at this business a day for the very first time is time in fact I believe that people getting involved in our business today you can achieve what we've achieved in half the time because everything is in place now for someone to be successful years ago we lost everything and today we look like a dream change my life completely I'm a different person is the one I was when I love it never had such a good time in all my life I don't really loved every minute of it because have really changed my life the future and this company is absolutely awesome you"

        "transcript": "hey guys so today I'm going to talk to you about my new closure this closure is from queenb vy.com um now usually before I buy hair online I usually do my research per four this time I didn't because I was in dire need of a closure um and I follow Queen Virg Remy on Instagram of course and I saw they were having a Jun summer sale and their closures which are usually $79 I want to say are now 50 and they're 50 for the remainder of June um so you know I decided to buy one so you know after I got it something told me to go on YouTube like why didn't I look this up before I bought it and there's only about I think I only saw two reviews on it and I think they're from the same girl who actually had a bad experience on the hair and I'm like my closure looks fine so after watching her video I saw that she bleached the closure you are not allowed to bleach the closure like it tells you that on a website do not bleach this closure it is not version here so I guess that is why her closure was messed up I'm going to pray that mine does not turn out like that but um just going to give you the specs on it it's really really dark I'm going to say it's just um maybe even a color one that's how dark black it is um I got mine in the 12 in only because I knew I was going to use it for my Bob so I got the shortest one they have 12 14 and 16 they're all $50 so you're going to get the most bang for your buck get the 16 in unless you have a bob of course you don't want to cut your closure too much um yeah so there it comes with no parting in it um the knots are not bleach the lace is like a light brown color and I will you know show you guys a clip of what it looks like before I have installed it but I basically want to show you guys how to properly bleach the knots just so you can have the most natural look to your closure and without worrying about the hassle of you know trying to find a piece of fabric that matches your scalp um using concealer and stuff like that this is a natural look very very nice it's a very very dense closure um the closure Al also features a um has like a protective a protective cloth around the perimeter of it so when you go Tex it from ripping basically um not to say that it won't Rip but it's less susceptible to ripping because it has the protective thing around it but I'm not going to talk anymore I want guys to see how to do this and what products to use and that is that so I will talk to you guys later bye so this is what the closure looks like straight out of the package it's very very dense there's no you know permanent parting in it so once you wet it and do whatever you have to do to it you can create where you want want the part at and like I said it's very very dense so you can really part it virtually anywhere however deep you want your side part that's what you're going to do there's also a lot of lace at the front for you to work with and there's a protective band around the closure to prevent it from ripping easily so I'm going to use the Purple kollider colors bleach and the 30 volume clarol cream developer you only need a little bit because you're only bleaching the knots and you want it to be a thick consistency so eyeball how much you put in there and just Stir It Up and you want it to be like paste not like soup and you want to just Pat over the entire closure once you're done with that you want to let it sit for about 20 minutes and then rinse it off with cold water and here you have a perfectly bleached closure [Music] go [Music] I'm going to use the elastic band method for my closures so it can lay flat and um you can use any elastic this time I have white I usually use black I couldn't find black this time but you want to just measure it to your head um so it can and from there you just sew it on"

        "transcript": "round number three of the 2008 nascar canadian tire series from barry speedway is brought to you by castrol syntec unlock the power by mopar authentic performance and by duplicolor the premium brand leader in automotive paints primers and coatings well scott stackley leads the field back to green here on lock number 30 of the aw 300. oh hard contact down into turn one you saw fiberglass flying as jason white the aw 21 got into the back wheel of the home hardware chevy of don johnson jr no caution but heavy damage to that 21 car well look for debris off the front of that car that fender is hung right in there by the tire it certainly won't take much for it to come off well jason white was racing hard to try and get back on the lead lap the first car a lap down of course alex tagliani received the tow truck in a box free pass during that caution period well everybody on the outside and the outside's not the fast way around here but you got to get that car to handle up top oh a big chain reaction coming off a turn two and this is what can happen on a tight track such as barry speedway john got jason half the way you see the 10 and up ground for the most damage to the 12 of john gott hathaway but the nose completely sheared off that snap-on tools dodge well we got the left front locked up and sitting up on the nose just sliding down the front stretch all kinds of structure damage i don't see any fluid coming out though as we go on toward the 39 of dave whitlock bye to see somebody gets in the left rear corner of the of the whitlock car turns him around and just stacks up the 12 and the three so jason hathaway with damage taunts in his pit extensive body damage to that number three snap-on tools car you can see the reciprocating saw going to work it won't be the last time we will see this tonight here at berry speedway guys as the body gets pulled off the number three jason hathaway so work continues big crowd on hand here tonight let's take a moment witch on for tonight's wheel and insider one of the great time and money savers for race teams is a car wrap now all of the graphics and colors on the zero two car for carry mix used to have to be done in stages beyond digital imaging has provided car wraps which really saves a lot of time in fact the entire car can be done in about seven hours another benefit to race teams if you're involved in a collision bdi provides perimeter repair kits you don't even have to take the body panels off the cars smooth out the surface clean it up and then the next wrap goes on to cover only the affected area it's great for one race sponsorships and much more it's a great way to maximize shop time and save money that's for sure and bdi also wraps the walmart cars of tagliani and andrew ranger and those cars will look real sharp restart here on lap number 42 it's the second restart of the evening scott steckley leads him out of four hits that restart line green flag wave so we're back underway thompson gets a real good jump that time he's going to hang in there on the outside because he has yet to gain his five points for leading the lap here at barry thompson strong on the high side you see that body damage from the last restart involved with jason white now he's gonna hang it on the outside he'll lead that lap pick up five bonus points and chevrolet to the front young jr fits patrick first race into dodge and his teammate as chevrolet is leading here at barry well you got to think don thompson jr has a lot of laps out front in recent years in the nascar canadian entire series even back into the cascar series thompson has led a lot here at berry speedway while he is seven-time champion of the old cascar division dave his teammate j.r fitzpatrick currently sitting in the 11th spot good look at scott steckley trying to put a move on the four of don thompson junior as mark dilling hangs in third not too far behind what a great shot you see that 22 of stackley as he powers down the straight away he drops onto the brake pedal the nose comes right down and seals off against the asphalt how about anthony simone in that 95 car the crowd modular monte carlo doing a wonderful job in his first time here at berry speedway never even seen the place before coming here earlier today really how's it figured out in a hurry well not a surprise to me dave oh fitzpatrick's around on the front stretch and it looks like the mopar dodge around both shot junior into him as well and looks like we may have some fluid down on the track steam coming from that 60 dodge of ronko jump junior oh the fluids running all over oh it just spills out the front there's the 12 car showing extensive damage let's have a look here on board with jr fitzpatrick well he got some help from the 39 of dave whitlock and there is the mopar dodger on beauchamp junior putting it behind the wall as the crew goes to work likely a rat needed to be changed on that car but they will go latch down as the 2008 dodge caliber srt4 pace cars pulled off and settled kaskar champion tom johnson jr will leave the field for restart number three green flag waves were packing away stack laid up in that high groove see if you can make that mopar thunder down the back dress no don thompson the preferred laid down the bottom and here comes mark dilly for a look as well well that's the first time the leader who has taken the green has actually left the first lap after a restart it's been don thompson junior and scott stackley swapping spots at the front of the field but here comes mark dealing for the first time here in the front well we talked about mark gilley knowing his way around this little speed plant and he's showing it right now and we got more smoke from the 39 nicki's dodge of dave woodlock no spin but it looks like a motor going awry on that dodger heavy damage to the crown modular 95 of anthony simone peter gibbons did dukes a hazard style over the front wheel and there is the 39 of dave woodlock stopped on the infield well obviously dave whitlock's lost a motor in that dodge of his but that really didn't get it all going here we go in a replay down into turn one they're all checking up the o2 gets attacked the 17 that gets them sideways we're four wide peter powers down to the inside simone's there and right over the top he goes that's exciting stuff so the 39 whitlock car is done for the day of low motor and heavy damage to the front of the 95 the wheeling safety crew cleans the track thompson leads"

        "transcript": "hello people of YouTube how are we all doing today it's Ryan here bringing you guys another farming video on Destiny first I'd like to say thanks to everybody I mean I my my videos been doubling for views it's not many but still just starting out with nothing having a few 100 and keep Rising every day and a few subscribers each and every day is it's pretty cool I mean thanks a lot guys really I'll keep I'll keep thisly any videos and spots but anyway today we're going to be on Mars you're going to have to take the strike so I recommend having two of your buddies you don't actually want anyone complete in this Mission as soon as you spawn you're going to see these vehicles you got to take and I recommend doing it obviously this is going to be the key to everything you to take it through those doors and into this kind of area but in this area be swarm more ball I can hopping off and killing all them beforehand I I did that for the sake of the video so I just kind of Breeze all through but definitely want to save the life on this thing don't want to don't want to die with it which I actually do unfortunately at the end of the video big fail on my part took so many takes trying to get it down but um yeah fail anyway so he just going to take this thing and we going to bring it back all the way towards the beginning of the map well I mean if you were to spawn in Patrol mode anyway pretty popular place with the Vex are fighting the cabal I found it kind of just walking through and seeing someone shooting some stuff and really figured out that way up top kind of broke the spawn and then on top of the cave and so on so forth but anyway having this tank it's it's a two rocket launchers and transportation and great kind of tank I guess you can pretty much summon up with so it's basically a great farming machine all in general found most of the spots there are to find so try to incorporate vehicles and whatnot to make it even easier I mean essentially if you can just hold a trigger and shoot and that's that's it you get engrams and you get whatever you need out of that's probably the best way to do it so definitely going to be kind of sticking with that more or less but anyway we're almost there we just got to keep on going almost there know it's a long drive but it's definitely worth it especially once you get going this is the kind of thing you can just hold the trigger and just oh you'll see it appear but we're here this is what we're looking for and for the sake of the video I killed everything more or less because I took so many takes the vehicle started dying and I started thinking yeah this isn't going to last much longer your should last long I've I've did this for an hour straight and I had no problems but uh once you get here you're going to back up in between these two rocks this braak is spawn for just the vs you want to start shooting right in that cave you're going to start doing it probably a little bit before I did start to work out you want to get it towards the top right corner so they spawn in the right then they walk up for about maybe maybe get five or six shots tops in that game you're doing it perfectly that is just enough to kill every one of them now worst case scenario the Minotaur will flash up one it'll still be in range to get hit by a rocket so you can do it just holding the trigger fortunately I don't get the perfect shot of that in this video vehicle was starting to die so many takes and sobody run around cuz the ball will spawn behind you you walk up a certain number of steps and that number of steps is pretty small but anyway that is basically how to farm the Vex from here I recommend backing up to it and just boom you got to get your firing down now sadly again I make a mistake and hit the rocket front that's basically you want to avoid that rock hitting that rock one time you got a headache but once you get it down it's good another way to do it is to farm both of them which is a little more complicated I wouldn't so much recommend it unless you got more than one person with you actually have this person on top of that one and you can uh go maybe behind that tree far the back and farm both of them but if you're doing this alone you can hop up on top of there now the Vex will spawn underneath you it doesn't register you as in their area so you got them coming like a ball towards uh the right I can see you see that yellow area in the Rocks I don't look exactly at it for you probably put a little YouTube thing over it but right there's where they spawn you can trap them pretty good all of his lieutenants are here now this is this is really good if you just kind of got a lot of time to kill want to waste a little bit of not playing time kind of watching you kill people time got to just sit there and do what you got to do this this is a great method got a few legendaries out of this especially when I first discovered first got the idea of bringing the vehicle there it worked out great I mean put a whole bunch of effort into it got to nail down this is this is going to have to do you guys know what you got to do taught you the method on how to get there you can handle the rest just want tell them to like subscribe comment have a good time doing it guys I mean I'll keep putting the videos out you guys keep viewing it and subscribing to it everyone's happy uh good luck out there guys"

        "transcript": "when discussions of the original Pokemon games come up there's usually going to be someone popping into the conversation will bring up pokemon green and will claim that it was either the very first Pokemon game or that I was so different looking from red and blue that it was never released outside of Japan I've noticed this sort of thing springing up in different Pokemon communities so I thought I'd shut some light on things to straighten things up you'd actually be surprised how screwed up the Pokemon game releases can actually be let's start with the first pokemon games ever released new year 1996 Japan saw the releases of both Pocket Monsters red and Pocket Monsters screen these were the two games that started the franchise off that made the series a tremendous hit and also provided a massive boost in sales for the already successful Gameboy platformer for whatever reason people seem to be under the impression that Green was the first release in the series and the red and blue soon followed after I suppose when looking around the net you can find quite a bit of confusing information that leads people to believe that Green was a standalone title and red and blue were always the primary pair due to Green never having been given an international release in reality Pocket Monsters red and green were the first games released in the series followed by blue and then Pikachu edition otherwise known as yellow by most people the first thing people seem to jump on to are the sprites from green when compared to the sprites of the International releases one can see that Green has some really ugly looking sprites for the Pokemon in battles what most people don't seem to realize is that the international releases of red and blue are actually just Pocket Monsters red green and blue merged together into two titles but how does that work out you may ask for starters Green was not the only version with the ugly looking sprites originally both red and green had the original sprites you see here however when Pocky monster's blue was released in Japan have featured a set of updates including a new cerulean dungeon layout new in-game trades wild Pokemon in different locations including once only available within in-game trades from the previous versions and even a new set of sprites for the Pokemon unlike red and green blue was only available purchased for subscribers of a Japanese magazine called Coral coral comics you also fix several glitches that existed within red and green while also presenting a few issues of its own once the series was launched internationally on Cinnabar Island a trainer trades you his electrode for your right shoe after the trade is done he claims you're right you evolved what happened here was that Nintendo originally used the core game coding from red and green while using blue sprites layouts and scripts when the International versions were made in the original red and green versions you traded a right shoe for an electrode however in the blue version you actually traded a cadaver or a gravel err instead which explains why there is dialogue about an evolution taking place after trading since Kadabra and gravel are both evolved through trades into al-qassam and golem and as many of you may remember this is what some people used to attempt supporting their theory that writes you somehow evolved into a concerned creature called pika blue who actually just turned out to be a completely different and unrelated pok\u00e9mon called merrill so in reality Pocket Monsters screen does indeed exist in international releases and was simply changed into pokemon blue to sum it up neither of the original complete Japanese versions actually released outside of Japan as they were all mixed together in one way or another however there are two titles that never saw a release outside of Japan in any shape or form these games were pokemon stadium and pokemon card gb2 here comes team great rocket while you may think pokemon stadium did in fact come out what we actually got was japan's sequel POC him on Stadium 2 so does that make our pokemon stadium to japan's pokemon stadium 3 I'll explain Japan's first pokemon stadium game titled pocket monster Stadium was originally due to be released on the ill-fated nintendo 64dd however after years of being delayed the game was instead released on a regular n64 cartridge plans were made to keep the n64dd involved by making an expansion disc for stadium the biggest catch in that that anyone who had bought Pokemon Stadium was stuck with an incomplete game the game only contained data for fully evolved Pokemon with the exception of Pikachu it surprisingly did not include Raichu this meant you could not bring in all 151 Pokemon into the game and that you had to wait for a proposed add-on from add-on that was not even due until roughly more than a year later out of the original 151 Pokemon only 42 were supported in Stadium which left out 109 Pokemon not even all the fully evolved Pokemon were included such as Butterfree Pidgeot electabuzz and magmar Nintendo chose not to release this version as it would have been a gigantic ripoff not to mention a proper sequel with the ability to use all 151 Pokemon was actually available used by that time so Japan's Pocket Monsters stadium tube became our pokemon stadium meanwhile over in Japan the third title in the series was called Pocket Monsters stadium golden silver when it was released outside of Japan it was simply renamed into Pokemon Stadium to an interesting note is that the Japanese version was released on the same day as the Japanese version of crystal and even had the same mobile phone function so the Japanese version had however the mobile phone functions were removed from the International versions of crystal and stadium to the other Japanese exclusive title is a sequel to the Pokemon Trading Card Game known as Pokemon card gv2 here comes team great rock the game sported a bigger world a slightly more developed pot even current pokemon card set and the ability to play as a girl I honestly couldn't tell you what reason there is for the game not being released outside of Japan it doesn't appear there was ever any plans of bringing this game to the west but I think it may have had something to do with that being just a few months close to the release of the Game Boy Advance as well as the release of Pokemon crystal unfortunately there's no clear answer as to why this game was never released perhaps it was due to it there already being two major Pokemon releases around the same time along with a new handheld platform just around the corner or maybe it could have been just a possible lack of sales from the original title who knows all I can say is that it's high time we got a sequel on the DS if you can pump out annual sequels why not a new game for the pokemon card game come on in Tendo well hopefully I cleared a few things up as you can see first generation of Pokemon games for a blend of three games for everyone outside of Japan the first 3d game in the series wasn't actually the first and there was a sequel that was never released outside of Japan so the next time someone claims pokemon green was the supposed black sheep of the first generation games you can let them know that wasn't really the case and that there have only been two full pokemon games never released outside of Japan while there are currently three mystery dungeon titles available on Wii we're only in Japan it's still a bit too early to say that they won't ever be released outside of Japan oh and before I forget there was also a Pokemon pit cross game planned for the Game Boy and Game Boy Color but it was actually never made making one of the only cancelled Pokemon games to be known publicly"

        "transcript": "hey guys how's it going Toby here and welcome back to the second upload of today I really hope you have enjoyed the first upload that I did it was early on around 2: in the afternoon so thank you so much for all the support on that video I said to you guys if you can hit 300 likes before 700 p.m. tonight I'll upload this but you guys went crazy and got over 500 which is insane I'm so genuinely grateful because that support really does mean a hell of a lot to me and you guys really ear this so hope you do enjoy this episode as well this is the Fresh Start If you don't know already it's basically a complete run through from the start of FIFA 13 Al team so we can get used to doing things when FIFA 14 comes around but before we do get started if you're looking for any also Team Coins check the link in the description for the fifas shop. co.uk and is the discount code so be 10 for a really awesome 10% discount also I'll put their Twitter in there as well because they're doing some giveaways lately and you guys might be interested in picking up some free coins if you win which is pretty cool you can't complain but we're going to carry on with this episode and today we are doing some more silver trading all of our stuff that was in the watch list from last episode has finally been released it took 3 days for EA to sort out the problem with the watch list I thought that ridiculous so so long this problem has literally been in the game since the start of FIFA 13 if you guys have been playing this FIFA since the start when it came out on the web app and things like that you'll know of all the trade file the watch list all the glitches and all that stuff and it's still not fixed and it drives me nuts hopefully the next one will be better but as you can see we are selling our bronze team because we managed to win the bronze tournament and it's time to move on to a silver team see if we can win the silver tournament so what I need you guys to do is in the comment section down below list me some incredibly amazing silver players they can be overpowered they can be pacy they can be Godly long shot takers just let me know of some really awesome silver players down in the comments because I'm sure there's some that I don't know about just like Yara I had no idea about Yara and he turned out to be absolutely incredible so any players that are strong tall pacy I don't mind I can use most players I think my play style can be fairly versatile I hope we'll see how it goes but any SLE players that you'd really recommend down below and what formation would you recommend we've built a four 2 31 team what formation would you like to see next as you can see on your screen we've been going through all the deals I've been picking up same method as before 2K minimum and then however many coins you've got as the maximum price and it works so well we pick up a mle left mid 451 hopefully going to make a k or so profit on him this T Cid in a 451 as well 7,400 coins hopefully going to make a couple of K profit on him very very popular ctim mid it's a great formation I love that that formation he is an absolute God in Cid in a 451 we pick up an incredibly fast right back for hamburger he looks insane he actually looks very very good and I'm not surprised he goes for over 10,000 coins so hopefully we can make a couple of K on him we then manag to pick up a Marvel win I think you guys might be able to catch on to a pattern here basically py Silvers go for a crazy amount of coins so hopefully we can make a couple of K on win that' be brilliant what we're trying to do is basically get enough coins to make a fairly solid silver team I reckon for a silver team we're probably going to need around 45 to 50,000 coins to make something that's actually good competitive and will hopefully win us the silver tournament but if you want to carry on trading and perhaps make something a little bit more expensive perhaps 100K I might be able to do that and might take me a couple more episodes maybe two or three more episodes to get to 100K we'll have to see I might to do it in my lone shark series within I think six or seven episodes so I could do it if you want me to if you want me to build something that's a little bit more expensive but let me know down in the comment section if you have a team that's been built already like you built me one specifically for the series then go to my Twitter is in the description it's @ Toby Lon and then just send me the FootHead link because it makes it so much easier instead of listing all 11 players in a team so if you want to do that you are more than welcome but all the things that we've just been buying are now selling it took a long time it really did like seriously took a couple of days to sell everything that i' bought because I was trying to make sure I got the most out of them and I really wanted the coins because I wanted to make the best silver team I possibly can so I was really squeezing the amount of coins I could get out of these guys so it took a long time to sell I wasn't Panic selling to try and get a little quick sale our right back sells for 10,500 coins T sells for 8,900 McLean for 6.4 and we still have a few things to sell one thing that annoyed me was cachini would not sell even though he was the lowest by now for ages I'm Mara win does sell fairly quickly though for 12K and we still got all these players in our trade pile I may discard some of them because they're not going to sell for much I want to sell bungar and kuchini and we do manage to sell kuchini which is fantastic 4.6k so it's about a 2K profit which is not bad at all and finally bungart sells for 2K which is only a 400 coin profit but that does wrap up this episode hope you have enjoyed it if you have leave a like and don't forget to comment down below of some players or some teams but thank you so much watch you guys take care have an amazing day and goodbye [Music]"

        "transcript": "[Applause] [Music] what's happening Brian Tong here and welcome to the Apple bite it's all the good and bad stuff inside the world of Apple we're back from ComicCon 2011 and we were welcomed with open arms back at the office plus I brought you some goodies back with me but first let's get to the show now the MacBook airs are here and our scen at benchmarks rate the new 13-in Air as one of the best performing laptops on the market even outdoing the 13-in pro but what could possibly top that well Mac Rumors reports the big a is currently working on an ultra thin 15in MacBook notebook and it's already in the late testing stages Apple did tell us that this was the direction they were moving forward with after the very first MacBook Air release The Unofficial web blog claims this will be the next MacBook Pro Line with a 17-in model also in the works now there's no timetable for release yet the last update was in late February and even if they did update it it would be at the end of this year so don't hold your breath for them anytime soon until we get some more real information but does it make sense to completely remove the optical drive on the pr line and limit you to purchasing apps only through the Mac App Store so that Apple gets a larger cut of the profits of course it does that's becoming the Apple weighin you might get a sexier form factor but that's a bad apple now look at what they did to the new Mac Mini how many people are really going to buy that thing it looks like a cool shiny paper weight for $7.99 now it also looks like you won't be waiting too much longer for the next iPhone that's if you believe the China times who have pinpointed the release to the second week of September there are reports of Apple Stores reaching out to past holiday and part-time employees to help out from the middle of August to the middle of September the China times also reports that the iPad 3 may be delayed until Thanksgiving because of component shortages but I'm still saying it's not coming this year Apple doesn't need to release an iPad 3 just for a higher res display and a little speed boo 6 months later it just doesn't make sense now with all those rumors who can you really trust these days well 95 Mac reports Asian case manufacturers who have historically been on the money with unreleased Apple products are now shopping case designs for the next gen iPhone the case molds point to a larger display a larger home button and a thinner profile and it's a similar source to the one that leaked the iPad 2 case designs also up to this point Mac OS 10 lion seems to be a success after 1 million copies were download loed on the first day alone the number one issue that is probably driving you crazy is the inverted scroll directions that mimic devices like the iPhone and iPad but if you want to turn it off so it functions the way you're used to just go into your system preferences then select the mouse settings remove the check boox then you'll be back to what you're used to now lion also has some great features but my personal recommendation is that if you're a highend power user who does work with Photoshop Final Cup Pro Tools or any high-end programs don't do the update just yet but if you're more of a General user who uses the I apps and word processing the update will be worthwhile there are also people who have had trouble during the upgrade process so Apple has released a new update it's a patch for Mac OS 10.6.8 to fix this and you'll probably want to get this if you haven't already all right let's take a quick break and show you how to use one of the best features in lion called [Music] versions with Mac OS 10 lion you get autosave and versions two new features that are going to save you a lot of trouble when it comes to editing documents with autosave inversions you don't have to worry about losing any unsaved work let's open text edit to show you how it works once you make an edit you'll see edited show up at the top bar of the file click it and you'll see a little menu lock lets you lock the file so that no more changes can be made it's useful if you want to create a template or just prevent your doc from being changed if it is a template you can use duplicate in this menu to quickly create and open a copy of that file now if you're editing a document and realize you want to get it back to the way it was when you opened it click edited and hit revert to last saved version below that option is browse all versions now that autosave backs up all your changes you can browse all versions of a document click browse all versions to see how it works right now only a few Apple branded apps like text edit and ior support autosave and versions but hopefully other apps will be updated to incorporate these features thanks for that video now in more fun news we were away last week so we weren't able to report about the fake Apple stores that were popping up in China that captured the look and feel of a real Apple Store while selling authentic Apple products you Chinese people are amazing now the stores were so believable that even their own employees thought they were working for an actual Apple Store now two of the stores have been closed and not because they're completely ripping off Apple's retail design but due to a lack of proper permits also Apple might one up the stores with one of the best Jedi Mind Tricks of all time according to a survey released by Price Grabber 35% of all respondents intend to purchase the iPhone 5 without seeing anything or knowing anything about the actual device 59% of the people said battery life was the most important feature and 46% of the respondents said 4G was an important feature especially after a few episodes ago we told you how many users think their iPhones already have 4G all right let's announce our giveaway for the mic Gadget keyboard and the winner is Chris from Albuquerque he went deep into the archives to find out some of the brands that I rock and he'll be receiving the awesome Bluetooth keyboard case combo and since we're back from Comic Con we have a killer giveaway thanks to our friends at performance design products or PDP who also built the Kick-Ass Mortal Kombat arcade stick they're hooking you guys the Apple biters up with the official Captain America iPhone 4 cases like the one you see here but you won't be able to throw it it like a shield or protect yourself now we have five iPhone cases for you three iPod Touch cases to give away so send us an email to the Apple bite cet.com with your reason for why you deserve a case and if you beg hard enough you might get lucky all right that's going to do it for this week show thanks for watching and we'll catch you guys next time for another bite of the Apple [Music]"

        "transcript": "what's up YouTube uh Joshua Jones here I am the founder and CEO of government supplements.com uh basically I want to talk to you about a supplement that I um just recently got in and but first I want to tell you how um I came across this seven months if I'm not mistaken I seen it a while back a few years ago maybe when it first came out I'm not quite sure how long it's been out but um how I recently came across this this supplement is uh a couple of days ago I was reading on Facebook uh I seen a title and it said uh that Floyd Mayweather had been stripped of his title is a championship time so it means that it was an interesting topic as you know how hyped that fight was between him and Pacquiao I uh I won't even click the link but when I click the link kid pulled up an article uh stating that uh Floyd Mayweather had been stripped of this title and that um the reason why and the reason why he was he was found out that he was taking this this supplement that was supposed to be performance enhancing and the guy I can't remember the guy's name who's writing the article but he said that um he kind of got interested in this this product his supplement and uh he uh ordered him a bottle the name of the product was then uh went over to the website and he said he can basically get a uh 14-day trial a trial size for free basically you don't have to pay uh shipping hand which is a little over four dollars um I don't know why they're doing it but uh they charge like two payments which was a payment of 3.95 and then they charged one that was like a dollar and and some change very minimal and uh so I I I I I decided to get me a bottle that's how I know about the two payments but um I decided to get me a bottle of women uh with that being said um the name of the product is uh Miracle muscle and um like I said when I seen when I pooped when I pulled it up I uh um when I put it up I uh thought it looked familiar um but the guy that was writing the article he said that he said that uh do it in his article he said he was watching it over a period of of I think it was four weeks that he was taking it and he said that you know the first week is uh his energy levels was High second week energy levels was high third week and the fourth week um he said you know any other supplements that he would take that he would take um his energy levels will subside and drop off he said but with this supplement here he said that uh his energy level stayed high and he really liked that and he said one thing that he noticed about this soap and what is that and one thing the thing that they promised is that you will at least gain 15 pounds of muscle with this while losing fat poundage and the guy that was writing the article said that he lost weight burned fat without even trying to lose fat not doing those you know taking a fat burn or cutting back on food uh exercising but just going to the gym working out and he said he gained um 15 pounds of muscle while losing uh and burning fat just from taking uh Miracle muscle so I just want to read you a few things that's on the bottle um that was the only review that I wrote on uh that supplement but this is basically a preview of this supplement um they're 60 capsules in here it's a 14-day trial 60 capsules two caps in a day um it is a dietary supplement about like your um you know your DMZ your stream DMZ extreme muscle mass things like that um you got things like that so it's dietary supplement just like those things but it has a creatine and amino acids on the front and it says suggested uses take two capsules once daily with a full eight ounce glass of water um this company's out of um they're out of San Diego California um Scott 1000 milligrams of creatine monohydrate uh 250 grams of BCA blend with a leucine isoleucine unveiling and it has the ribose which is has a hundred milligrams per serving um and then those ingredients it has is Guillotine micro micro crystalline cellulose and magnesium stearate uh and that's problem that's probably where maybe for the one of the sizes comes from is that the steer rate that's that's in there but basically this is a a preview now today was my first day taking it I took it oh and checked my mail so it's a little after 12. um so I I took it about 12 12 30. and um the day was my first day taking it I still have approximately 13 days left but I'll go through and give you update uh video updates of what's going on changes in my body I'll let you see those as well and we'll see what it looks what I look like after 14 days now today being the first day I um I did a bicep workout in the back workout and uh I got actually got a good workout in so um with continued progress through taking this supplement we'll see how things go we'll see if it's uh what that writer of the article said it is um and and if it does work I'll be getting more of this and once once I get completely done with it I will do a review um I will do a video review and also do a review on my site grow myself.com so but with that being said guys uh stay tuned for more information on Miracle muscle let's see how it works um let's see if it's uh let's put it to the test but guys have a good one uh click out look at the rest of my videos go and check out my site check out the reviews and some of the products I have available

        "transcript": "yo this is Major slack and just when I thought I was out they pull me back in yep Far Cry 2 fortunes pack is now about available for PC and this involves three new weapons two new vehicles and five new multiplayer maps and what I most particularly interested in is the weapons and the vehicles and so why I installed it yesterday and went into my Armory you know and there they are just sitting there ready for the take and you don't have to do any weapon shot missions or buy them up they're just there so go on the Armory and here they are three new weapons one primary one secondary and one special and it features a Craftsman shot shotgun double barrel shotgun that's your secondary weapon new secondary weapon and it features a silenced shotgun that's your new primary weapon and a crossbow with explosive tips and that's your new special weapon so let's go take a look at them that's my homemade machete by the way I'm going to show you that how to get that in another tutorial anyway here is the double barrel crafts men shotgun it uh packs a pretty big wall up but um it reloads really really slow let me tell you it's uh anyways I got I'm going to make another video showing me using it in combat it's uh just really a how should we say an acquired taste but it does pack a big wall up and um to demonstrate we can do a little test here uh Place ourselves um at a certain distance from this truck okay and what we're going to do is um aim directly at the radiator on the truck and see how many shots it takes to get this truck spewing black smoke which as you know means the truck is critically damaged and it will eventually catch on fire and blow up so that's three shots look how low slow it look four shots double barrel reloads after every shot five shots and six shots and it is now officially spewing black smoke that means that this truck is critically damaged and it will eventually blow up it will cast fire and it'll blow up so six shots from the Craftsman's shotgun to get this truck critically damaged so I don't know um like I said it's probably for shotgun offici and anal I have to admit I really suck at the shotgun I'm uh I rarely use it I'm more of a sniper man sniper and then you know when it comes to secondary weapons um Mac 10 Uzi stuff like that there it is it blew up and just by way of comparison uh we can do the same test with the Homeland shotgun okay here we go here's the Homeland shotgun and see how many shots it takes you know Place ourselves at the exact same distance I know this is a crew test but you know Place ourselves the exact same distance and see how many shots it takes to get you know this truck speeding black smoke six as you can see the fire rate on the Homeland shotgun is a lot faster eight nine and is now officially spewing black smoke okay so that's six shots for the Craftsman shotgun and nine shots for the Homeland so that's the difference and um you know like I said Craftsman shotgun probably for shotgun ifan I'm not not that great with the shotgun but I can learn I don't know anyways you know the the uh the download was five bucks they dropped the price from 10 to 5 it's only five bucks that's it that's how long it how many shots it took for the Homeland to get that truck critically damaged so now let's take a take a look at the the silenced shotgun I thought this was pretty cool the only drawback with this is It's a primary weapon so that means giving up my precious sniper rifle I don't know if I could bear with it but you know anyway so I give it a shot and it actually has stealth applications that really uh really works you know you can actually use it in a stealth environment like you know as the stealth attack is pretty quiet I'm going to show you in another video I used it to take down a a three guard post and doing the same test here it's going to come out the same as the Homeland nine shots to get this uh truck critically damaged nine shots there we go and it's spewing black smoke I think the fire rate is probably about the same too the only thing is it's it's silenced so and it works it actually works so that's that like I said the only thing I don't like about this is It's a primary weapon which means giving up my my sniper rifle where's the Craftsman shotgun now I'll gladly trade it well not gladly but you know you know I'll trade in my macro pistol or I'll trade in my uh my Mac 10 you know Just for kicks so that's that and finally let's take a look at the uh the crossbow with the explosive tips here it is crossbow with explosive tips special weapon now I'll gladly trade in my rocket launcher for this especially in the beginning of the game you know cuz then the rocket launcher only has three shots in the beginning of the game and you can eventually get up to five shots I believe if you buy the rocket tier Satchel but this has five shots right out right from the GetGo and you don't even have to buy it it's already there right there in the armor me nice touch with the pause animation there and um of course you know you shoot it then it blows [\u00a0__\u00a0] up you know and it's got a nice scope on it beautiful scope the only thing I don't like about it is it the sound is not as satisfying as the rocket launcher you know when you when you fire the rocket launcher it's got that you know this is like that you know tastes like a you know and then then it blows up like this that's the only that's my only grape about it but other than that you know it's pretty good and it supposedly has uh the ability to set grass on fire but I found with you know kind of touch and go with it sometimes it would work sometimes it wouldn't sometimes you know when I expected to fully set the grass up or it wouldn't you know like that let's try it over here there we got a brush fire going there so it it was kind of like I don't know hit and miss on that but as far as far as blowing [\u00a0__\u00a0] up great great stuff so this was pretty good and you know Craftsman shotgun pretty good silence shotgun pretty good but you got to give up your primary weapon slot so I don't know anyways all in all Far Cry 2 Fortune pack five bucks I think it was a good deal"
