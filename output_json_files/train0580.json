        "transcript": "foreign [Music] hi everyone and welcome to my place here is the bouquet that I made for Samantha she wanted a rose and Berry bouquet for a late Autumn wedding she wanted it all in artificial and she also wanted to know what kind of a buttonhole to go with or for a man or kind of a buttonhole to make for to go with the bouquet right I've got a few roses here I've got a few berries and I've got some leaves the thing the leaf goes with the rose so we'll use that I'm also going to use an IV lift to finish it off I'm also going to wire it so the roses have all been wired in fact I will show you how to do that because some people need to know how to do that right the reason you why is so that you can manipulate the placement of the flower and also it removes a lot of the bulk from the flowers when you're using fresh or artificial well fresh flowers anyway sometimes it's best to get rid of that stem because thick the bud can snap off at the head so it's just a matter of getting the wire and I'm using about a 22 gauge wire put that up there like that and then just twist that around there like that so that you've got instead of having that big thick stem you've now got this lovely little wide stem that you can do whatever you want to do with right or I've got a a bud or a slightly smaller Rose and two sort of like one's a bit bigger and one's a bit smaller uh sorry a small medium and large roses now with these berries I want to get rid of as much of this bulk as I can so cut that off and then rewire it so I'm just going to push that wire through there bring it down and then holding it in the left hand or the right-handed whichever way you um whether you left a right-handed and then just twist that down and around there like that now the weight of the wire I know that that's the perfect weight for that white for the berries that I've wired because it's still standing erect and isn't tipping over so that's how you know now with the leaf it's just a matter of what I do with these is I get the wire and I put a little like a little wee slant cut there then take that through where your main vein of your Leaf is and then bring that down like so and then twist that around now I've got another a bigger Berry and I've got the rose leaf so that's just going to go onto there like that and I'll do the same thing just take it up through that sit that leaf up there and then just bring that down like that and then just twist that around there like that perfect now I can manipulate it right once you've got everything wide it's just a matter of oh tape and tape tape tape always tape tape tape to cover those unsightly wise over because don't forget that they are just your mechanics right there's one taped is the next one taped and the least stem you've got the better it is because as I said it's going to get rid of all that unnecessary bulk and then I'll just do the same with that and with the leaf that doesn't take very long and you know like if you were using fresh you could do the tape and why everything the day before and then just cover it under like some wet sort of like paper towels or something like that and then put it together the next day but we'll get into care and maintenance of flowers another day right that's all covered and that's my last one that needs to be covered like so right there's my structure in and that's there's everything's going to be joining at that point there right get your bud put your bud onto there like that put your next one that's the next one I want to use put that there and then I'm going to put that slightly smaller one there like that and then getting those oh it's lovely putting that there and because these are artificial I can manipulate these put that to there holding everything in your hand if you find that it's going to move just get a guide wire and just tape around there and this tape's great the plastic one because everything sticks onto itself right almost finished put the leaf up the back like that twist that around there like that again so that that there is going to actually go against the fabric of the jacket or whatever cut those bits there take that down like that cut those bits off like so and then tape again so we've got quite a few stems in there but you'll see that we've got a nice nice fine handle or stem with so this as I said there's lots and lots and lots and lots of forms in there but look what we're left with really nice now because the bouquet has got the jute into it oh the burlap and I've got that lovely little burlap selection of roses there and it's on the handle and I've got the Rope or jute hanging down I thought it would be quite nice to just and I know that boys don't have bows but for goodness sake why not head a little bit of just a little bit of glue on top there and then just push that into there like that that easy ready to go how quick and easy was that I hope I've been of assistance to you Samantha and I will see you all another day foreign [Music]"

think 303 or 305 so a little bit more for 100 pounds since surgery um things have kind of been crazy lately with the weight loss I had a lot of weight loss and then it slowed down and then I had a law and then slowed down so I've been kind of back and forth um but just consistently losing not really gaining anything um my body has changed some more so I am down to about a size 12-14 my pants for a little bit bigger they're about a 16 just because my hips have now decided to to make an appearance in my life um my face has slimmed down quite a bit more just being able to see more of my body um has been a little crazy I said earlier our earlier videos that just ditch changing of your body no longer having so much back fat all that good stuff um when I smile now I don't have three chins that's always nice um what I want to talk about today so I what I really want to talk about and kind of been prevalent to me right now is hair loss I'm losing a lot so I was pretty protein deficient when they you need to take your protein they're not jokin um the other thing is multi vitamins really getting on the multivitamins I kind of struggled up with that lately just because of working so much and getting everything in I have been going to restaurants for the first couple times now really struggling with that really struggling with being able to knock while everyone else is still eating and I'm done after two bites my co-workers won't let me order food anymore because I don't eat hardly anything so I'm really just knowing where you're at and in restaurants too um I think is a good help you know having a buddy that you can split something with you don't feel awkward I'm having trouble right now just explaining to my to my significant other how much I'm able to eat he still wants to eat a lot and I can eat very little and so um I'll try to say hey can I share something with you and he still wants his whole plate so um that's kind of something that you if you're thinking about having the surgery you really should talk to your spouse that to know that you really aren't going to be able to eat that much and that that's going to affect their diet is much it's going to affect yours so money wise it's I mean it's cheaper cheaper just to order one meal but sometimes people are territorial about their food so come to know that I had fun before you have surgery of how that person will react to it when you start going to smaller portions when you go to restaurants with your family you're not going to be able to get a smaller potion most of the time i will do half orders i will do a hospital her but even on the kids menu kids menu I found is not really that healthy I mean sometimes it's easier just to get a salad and get a half salad then it is to go off of the kids menu so really know that you can't rely on kids menus that you're going to have to find other ways to do different things and kind of some other things uh adjusting to your body I just seemed to your body around other people I have found that I before was not okay with people who hugged me or you know that kind of stuff I still struggle with that even smaller and people don't struggle with hugging me anymore so that has been kinda quite adjustment to get used to to be able to be hugged and they don't have to hug so much they don't have as much to hug either um I've been clothes shopping a lot lately I'm having to close shop now a lot more just because I'm not able to fit into anything my lowest jeans that I had in my in my closet was a 22 and they fall off of me now they're just no ahead i can wear them so um just getting used to being in smaller clothes and how much fun that is sicko shopping and to be able to go into any store and i don't have to worry about what i wear or the sizes um so i want to stand up and do a 360 so you all can see kind of where I'm at in the progress and we'll Jack it on I'll take this off this is actually a dress I got it target on sale so shout out to target and sales I'm at my mother's so excuse the mess around the bed but this is you know my arms are still pretty big I'm ready for them to go down some more but they're not as big as what they usually are so this is about how much and a lot of that is extra skin you can see as I turn that a lot of that is extra skin so can't wait for that to be gone a lot of toning is going to be happening pretty quickly um so yeah I have a smaller midsection and just getting smaller all around um more of a shape to this dress is about a size 14 so that's what I'm working with now my legs have all but are all but gone kind of a tease about this but they're even smaller than what they were before my feet heavy been went down I'm about a size and a half smaller than what I was before on my feet so um that I think is everything um I don't think I have anything else congratulations to everybody who is getting surgery I'm talk to have quite a few people that are now going to have surgery um I wish you the best of luck and make sure that you do your protein or your hair will fall out so everybody thank you again everyone who supports me and deals with craziness of my life and I will see you all at the next update hi you"

        "transcript": "good day yeah I know it's been a while in between tutorials and videos but I've been rather busy and with a new job starting I'm even going to be busier so I'm going to get on with this I've been requested by one of you to make some tutorials on DVD decrypto and DVD shrink oh yeah for those of you who don't know me there I am with my best mate okay now when I'm copying a DVD that I've bought myself not one that I've hired out from the video shop okay naughty naughty anyway whatever regardless of whatever you do the first thing that I do is I try and use or I try it out with DVD shrink before I even bother with decrypto because 99% of the time shrink will do the job saving you half of the work now this is version 3.2 now that's important because earlier versions are just crap this is free open source software so just type into Google DVD shrink 3.2 and you'll find yourself a site where you can download it the same with dvdd crypto it's free all right so and then um on that 1% of the time when um shrink won't do the job it'll come up with a message telling you that it can't get past the encryption and that's when you use DVD [Music] decryptor okay it's now make sure like in my case I have two drives make sure you got the right Drive selected 18 files in this particular one it's all ready to go so we hit decrypt and now it's starting to do the job all right this will take a while so I'm going to hit the pause button because there's no need for you guys to sit here waiting while all of this happens okay we're going quite nicely there nearly done oh isn't that nice make sure your speakers are turned down otherwise you  frightened out of you all right operation successfully completed copied 18 files skipped zero files so that's all good now where those files are gone in my case it's gone to my D drive that's the name of the movie swingers don't worry it's not porn it's a comedy I actually found this on my front lawn one day weird anyway if you're not sure where that is just click here and it'll show you see in my case there there's my C drive this is my D drive with a whole pile of other stuff and there's the particular one that we're looking for okay so let's go there now that we know where it is navigate there my computer best movies I got a lot of stuff there it is there swingers let's see what size it is just out of curiosity 3.74 gig so really there's no need to run this one through shrink what I would do in this case is I would bring up um let me just click some stuff here I'd bring up my Nero burning ROM okay make sure you have DVD selected of course and this one here DVD video okay and just click new and I'll just expand that and again go to the folder where the vob files are here they are video TS and that's them all there so you just grab all of these and you drag them into video TS you don't worry about this audio TS there's nothing you put in there just just even forget it exists you don't it's all in the TS and there it is there 3,750 Meg if I click that burn that would burn the to disk for me okay so that's it with that all right let me just get rid of that because I'm not going to do that let's just say that it was you know 9 something gig and we needed to put it into shrink okay let me just bring up Dov do shrink so let's pretend here shrink there it is what we do is we don't do open dis like you normally do we go open files and there it is there so just click okay now we'll read all of that fast motion let me just hit pause right don't forget this is only if it's over 4.7 gig that and some of the things here you may not want not in this particular one but in some DVDs they have different languages and you know you're not interested in those so you know like let's say this was German and this was French and this will Spanish and this will Mexican whatever Italiano you know you just yeah uncheck those saves yourself a bit of space and stuff like that so don't forget we're pretending here that this is for .7 um or I mean 9 something and we want to shrink it down to 4.7 so that's all ready to go then it's just a case of click the old backup um you can set the folder where you want your temporary files to go to I generally a desktop because it's easy accessible to get rid of so that's all go go go go click that and Away you go this would now and this I got a reasonably well it used to be a reasonably fast comp computer I'd call it middle of the road now I am doing an upgrade real soon see here it says that it's not encrypted so you know I could have done this one with DVD shrink straight up and not worried about decrypter but I did it for um example sake and plus it's the only legal DVD that I've got CU I found it on the front lawn all right so that's it uh when this is finished I'm not going to wait um it will then sort of spit it out and ask you to put in a blank youve whack in your blank and Away you go it'll do it all for you good job all right I'll do the tutorial on DVD shrink a little bit later because I'm running short of time and I have to get myself off to work shortly all right for those of you that have made positive comments and and even those of you just asking questions um I'm happy to help if I can I get an average of three to four emails a day doesn't take too long to answer and uh yeah makes it worthwhile for me all right catch you later"
