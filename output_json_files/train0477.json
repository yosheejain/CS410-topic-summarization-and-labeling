        "transcript": "hey guys Jay nasty here what is up guys uh this is just a little gameplay it's a little rant um it's just my opinions on Black Ops 2 so far and as you guys know I'm a very rush rush happy player I like to move around a lot in this game and uh it seems to be a plague in this game it seems that the more passive you play the better you know the better score lines you're going to get and it's really difficult especially with wink wink skill-based matching which I don't know I don't I like I don't face noobs like I said I don't face people that um just run around and play the game you know I don't play those types of players anymore I just play a lot of [\u00a0__\u00a0] dag Pricks I'm going to call them Pricks cuz they're pricks I just play against the the worst bunch of passive players ever and I'm just and I just die from the stupidest [\u00a0__\u00a0] in this game play Watch How I die from just tell me when I just get outplayed I just want you guys um honest answer guys just tell me when I get outplayed um in this game play I think my end score was 72 and 16 I died once from an an actual gunfight and what I mean by an actual gunfight is the other guy had an SMG or an assault rifle and just outplayed me um and that was one time you know and this is the reason why I'm hating Black Ops 2 is you know sniping shotguns equipment are the only things that kill me in this game no nothing else kills me in this game except for like I said snipers shotguns equipment or or camping it nothing else kills like nobody just out [\u00a0__\u00a0] plays me you know what I mean nobody can just run up to me drop shot me or jump shot me real quick and just I can't be like wow that guy's a really good player I don't run into those types of players anymore I just run against these these [\u00a0__\u00a0] sniping douche lobbies and I I I don't know what to do because I'm getting I'm getting out I'm getting outgunned by snip it's not even I'm not even getting outgunned I'm just getting out bullshitted and it's just really annoying as a really good player I know what I can do in this game and I know when I face players like this of this stature [\u00a0__\u00a0] terrible players you know I know I should be doing better I know I should have dropped 100 plus but I can't I can't control the fact that I'm getting quick scoped like this [\u00a0__\u00a0] [\u00a0__\u00a0] in his spawn over and over again I can't help that I can't do anything about it I try to run at him the the only possible method that I could do in this game and this is this is like just constant [\u00a0__\u00a0] he was completely stunned the only the only method that I can do is try to flank them and it's almost [\u00a0__\u00a0] impossible to do that too because they [\u00a0__\u00a0] all in their spawn and and it's just ridiculous man there's too many head glitches watching the flank and that's what makes this game near impossible sometimes to flank you you really it's a struggle to flank even I have like it's hard for me to struggle or it's hard of me to flank hard for me to flank because there's a [\u00a0__\u00a0] head glitch there there's a [\u00a0__\u00a0] head glitch there there's Longs line as side I'm using an SMG I'm getting outshot by a [\u00a0__\u00a0] sniper that I'm putting three shots into with an SMG and I'm still getting out outshot it's not I'm getting outplayed I'm getting outshot and I don't know how to fix this the snipers man they need a [\u00a0__\u00a0] nerve dude there's no Flint there's no sway there's they zoom in [\u00a0__\u00a0] quicker than you can [\u00a0__\u00a0] take a [\u00a0__\u00a0] uh if you had diarrhea or some something stupid like I I don't know this is a big rant it's 4:30 in the morning and I'm just tired of playing [\u00a0__\u00a0] heads I want to play some people that [\u00a0__\u00a0] go for the objective I want to play against some people that move around you know or at least give a [\u00a0__\u00a0] about trying to win and at this game at the end of the game I'm going to show you this guy's this uh his combat record and I even I found a worst player with the worst combat record that I'm going to talk about probably in a couple of days so um this is just pissing me the [\u00a0__\u00a0] off bro I'm getting mad I getting mad because people like this just outplay me because they don't [\u00a0__\u00a0] move they use a sniper that can instant kill you SMGs are just [\u00a0__\u00a0] garbage now uh it's a hit marker machine from 10 ft away and it's it's it's honestly insane and plus with the inconsistencies in this game where bullets don't register half the [\u00a0__\u00a0] time it's just really annoying and if you guys saw how many times I died from something other than a sniper equipment or a shotgun or [\u00a0__\u00a0] some guy not camping in a building waiting for me like a [\u00a0__\u00a0] [\u00a0__\u00a0] just leave a comment I don't know and this is this guy's kdr 1.95 kdr with a 1.8 or 186 War per minute this is the typical [\u00a0__\u00a0] douchebag player in Black Ops 2 the kid that camps vers kdr this doesn't give a [\u00a0__\u00a0] about uh his score for playing the objective he just camps and hey that's that's all he's about is sitting in his [\u00a0__\u00a0] spawn he went 24 and 12 against me and his team lost at the end of this game play they lost by like 200 to 78 so uh sorry for the rant but this had to be done this game is just it's it's it [\u00a0__\u00a0] hates people that like to move it really does and it benefits players like wings of redemption play style that [\u00a0__\u00a0] are terrible players but it benefits them for not moving sorry I'm pissed I'm pissed"

        "transcript": "hey guys wiky welcome to another Clash of Clans video today we're doing a three star series episode with a visu from exlo he's doing a go we wipe on this newish channel 10 um before I go ahead though um we do have a 22,200 gem giveaway in the uh Link in the description below and I want you guys to enter so you we can give you some gems um and you have 22 chances to win so make sure you enter that in the link in the description below and um if looking at the base it's got Max 10 or9 defenses with two level two infernos and an extra Expo um but it's quite impressive with go we wipe it's not usually a three star strategy so uh a lot of people use go lavaloon Laval lonian um they're more of a three star strategy so uh it's quite impressive when people actually three star a town all 10 like this so the main points I want to give out for a go wipe or go we wipe um whatever is if you can lure the clan castle get them out of the road first cuz you don't want that clan castle shooting down your peckers um distracting them while they're getting shot up in the middle of the base um the reason for this is peckers are quite slow so even against um archers inside the castle uh you don't want the peker to be getting uh Tesla shotted while he's trying to whack the archers one at a time so uh try to do that if not if it's too hard to Valour and it's too cost effective uh you bring a lightning spell because that's what you need to do so what side you want to come from with a go wipe or go we wipe is if the Archer Queen's not in the center you want to go the arch Queen side um the reason for this is once you get into the center and if the arch Queen is not in the center compartment uh she will start shooting and distract your troops away from the center um towards her so always try to do that um on the arch Queen side so when you lure as well if you can use the troops that you lured with and um kill the clan castle with um that that's awesome make sure you try to attack where you lure the troops and kill them because you can still use the leftover troops from that attack uh towards attacking the base so that's the only uh tips I that I have to give you with go we wipe and um let's go ahead and see what aisu does with his attack aisu starts off with with a giant and a few Hogs to start luring that clan castle troops fortunately for him there is none so he can uh disregard that bit of the attack so now he's going to be looking to an entry point to start attacking from so he's going to start off in the western corner with one Golem and a Golem um to the top as well with some Wizards so he's is going to start uh clearing for his peckers and his Heroes to get to that center point cuz we want to knock out that town hall area as well and um those inferos so these kind of attacks you kind of really need uh high level heroes to get a three star gives you a better chance for a three star if I did this with my heroes um which are only uh in the in the teens uh I wouldn't get a three star so he's got a jump spell in the corner there to get towards the center the good PL thing about the placement of the jump spell is he's got access to four of the sections so um where the arch Queen is the town hall and that wiiz toow is he's got access to that so that's a really good jump spell placement on the corner there and uh the good thing about peckers is they don't really get affected much against multi Inferno so if you had the chance uh between free spelling the Teslas or the infernos when it comes to peckers uh make sure you freeze the Tesla so the rest of the attack now is going good he's got his Barbarian King still alive they he's still got the abilities he's going to uh rage his Barbarian King to get through that wall and his arch his Archer Queen still has a royal cloak so it's going really well at the moment the good thing about witches as well in the Army composition is that it's good distraction for against the defenses especially single Target defenses cuz they'll be shooting the skeletons um while the rest of these troops are attacking these defenses so it's kind of like another tank mechanism for your army composition so the arch Queen's using Royal cloak now um going through another wall which is unfortunate um but he's still got his barbarian king and a whole lot of troops left and his Pekka so I hope you guys enjoyed that three star go wee wipe on a town hall 10 and um let me know in the description below if you use goe wipes much in town 10 and how you go with it so um hope you guys like that video smack that like button subscribe to my channel if you're new and I'll see you guys next episode later [Music] guys oh"

        "transcript": "[Music] hello everyone chris or nexus here and today i'm going to be showing you guys well teaching you guys how to dupe your items in daisy uh and no you're not going to get global band because i know it's probably the first thing that came to your mind well when you read the title and when you're watching this video you are not going to get global ban you're not going to get banned don't worry you don't need any scripts you don't need any hacks nothing that will result in a ban um so you're good there uh it's actually really easy it's only about four steps i'm pretty sure three or four steps and it works on all servers uh both private hive and public uh the few public that are still up um so yeah i'm just gonna let's get into this i'm recording my screen uh well because there's not really much of a point in just recording the game it'll be just to show you that it works on both types of servers and plus it involves closing the game so for private hive i'm just going to join this pvp server you basically spawn with an m40a3 rangefinder gps and all that other other cool stuff so as we wait for as we wait for the id for me to get into the server that's going to tell you guys actually how you do it beforehand so basically all you need to do when you get in the server and say you have all your stuff you know your weapons and stuff and you don't want to lose it all you have to do is well pull out your pistol i'm i don't think it matters but just stand up and it appears that that server was actually full so we're going to just get on one here that has that actually spawns you with uh with you with some type of weapon just to show you anyway um because this server it says it was full we'll see if we can join it again oh you can okay but anyway so basically all you do you just stand up pull your pistol okay you all you have to do is just alt tab out of the game and uh close it without going back into the game okay and all you have to do is join the join back to the server uh and when you spun back in there'll be actually a dupe of your body there and you can actually loot yourself and take double of what you had before and i'm going to demonstrate it in a couple of minutes as soon as i um get into this server and then i'll show you on a run a public server just just for proof that you can also do it on public not just private hive i was actually expecting you wouldn't be able to do it on private hive but uh you can now i'm not the one who figured this out actually my friend and a couple of other people did while they were playing um and then they told me and so i decided just to make a video and help out other people and you know to tell you guys how you can dupe your items now we're just a bit in here um the final stages of the joining process and there we go receiving loading and we're going to get in in a couple of seconds okay i'm probably gonna lag because i'm recording my screen yeah okay um so basically as you can see uh as the server title states you do spawn with a sniper a pistol and some other stuff here nothing in your backpack but that will change soon basically all you want to do okay just stand up switch to your pistol and i'll and um just for i think i'm sorry for my frames uh it's gonna be a little bit laggy i think even though it's at 50 and 60 right now but sometimes it will lag but don't worry we're not going to be moving much anyway so when you're standing up you got your pistol out all you need to do is just hit the alt and tab on your keyboard and you'll see this will pop up now for you it'll probably be easier just to go to your desktop okay but i'm just going to go to skype okay and as you see that right here you will see that i'm not in the game so all you need to do is just right click close the window and you'll see that it just shut down and you can just minimize that and you can bring back up daisy commander and then join the server again now as we wait for the for me to get back into the server i'm just going to cut here and i'll see you when i get in the game okay guys i'm back i managed to get the server as it is pretty popular um i had to wait a few seconds or minutes actually to get in because it was completely filled 50 out of 50 people but i managed to get on and i'm just going to load in to the game and when we get in you'll see that there is a copy of my person in there that i can loot and get to double my things so that's good since beginning here which will be in a couple of minutes again it was pretty relatively quick the first time so there's no need to pause or cut here so while i wait we will and listen to the silence and possibly fan noise no i'm joking i'll probably uh it's gonna it'll be gone don't worry um audacity is my friend ah as soon as it decides to put me in the server and oh there we go thank you jeez they don't understand i'm trying to make a video here god okay there's the beautiful receiving text that everyone loves to see okay and you're like wait what's that hand oh wait is that a double of me oh whoa that's crazy look at him he's like hey look at me i'm you and now as you can see if you do scroll on that person's body you can actually gear him and bam there is everything that you've had before now you can do this with pretty much anything you want if you have a tent in there you can actually be able to place the tents and um you can store more stuff in that and just stoop everything like crazy getting a lot of things and it'll work out great you can do this with your friends and you'll basically be an unstoppable force on whichever server you decide to do it on so yes as you can see i now have um everything basically everything that i had and he's fully he's fully lootable um i can even look in his backpack but there's nothing in it so that is about it for that you could it you can't he's like you can't do anything with it other than just loot but that's all we really want to do and he'll just stand there other people can see it but since we took everything they're not going to get anything so there you go that is the proof that it does work on private hive um i think i think i'll show you guys no yeah you guys are just going to have to take my word for the fact that it works on public servers because i really don't feel like doing the whole thing again but anyway i

        "transcript": "[Music] this is what comes to mind when you imagine a golden Wheat Field my husband and I were searching for a better type of wheat for our children and imagining a more sustainable way of growing it 5 years ago we began our mission to bring back in corn and today we are proud to be growing this most ancient wheat on this Farm in Italy the difference here is the Rolling Hills the abundance of trees and the way the farmer takes care of his land and our crops each year I'm happy to take you along with me today so you can meet our farmer and see exactly where this nearly extinct grain found a breath of life again today I'm 30 minutes outside of Sienna at one of our largest organic in corn farms and I'd like to introduce you to Leonardo hi Carla hi Leonardo uh welcome in PTI here we are in the suburb of Sienna H in the top of the tosan tosan hill our farm pvas salti is a very anent Farm it was from the 4th Century after uh after Christ and it was the holidays House of the Archbishop overit our family buy the farm in 1978 because because we was interested in this landscape that is a a very nice place to produce cereals and forage for our cows we love to live in this Countryside and uh uh preserve the countryside so uh we haven't never used chemic chemical and uh just organic and just rotation so you're in a very remote location in Tuscany can you explain what you decided to focus on to make this Farm economically viable we was obliged because to compete with the other big farm in the north that have big production RS we have to find anent cereals to have something differ to offer on the market and so we decided to ReDiscover anent grade Ancient Grains Ancient Grains also to produce this anent grain is not easy we have to to to make a rotation to make something to to give uh to fertilize the to fertilize the soil because Ancient Grains don't yield as much it's very dry here see so what about growing you know a modern soft wheed here as opposed to Growing iron corn does iron corn require a lot of water or no iron corn is very rustic and uh I think is special for our Countryside here we have we don't have any water just uh lots of Sun so we're going to go see the in corn fields those Safari dusin Safari does the in corn is it harvest corn little bit later because we plant later we plant uh last cereal that we plant our old parents they says that to have good cereals is best to plant in the first week of November first week of November this Farmland is extensive and spans nearly 2,000 acres yet only about half are used to cultivate Ancient Grains the rest is left as forest or pasture this creates a balanced ecosystem that focuses on the health and fertility of the land so I've heard a lot of people well researchers that we've talked to that say the most beautiful thing about in corn is to see it swaying in the wind and he's is always windy [Music] EAS so here we are in our in corn wheat this is this 50 Jo jovia flour pasta we have some Modern soft weed and we've picked some of our ankcorn wheat to show the difference in the height yes it's very high very very high the in corn is really really small small small very small and in Italian they call it phop Piccolo far piccolo yes because it's so small little and this is a modern soft wheed as you can see the difference in the size of the spikes on the top we have also many much uh grains many grains on one yes yes but in fact one of the big problem that we have when we Harvest is if in this period it rain we have a strong rain you go down and is difficult so we hope that is very very small very small so the Harvest is is low yelds because of the size of the green too yes is like round this is very PL you select your seeds we have special machine and we select our own all our grains that we plant we decide before to start to harvest where is the best place in which we take grains to to select for the next for planting the next year so you're saving your seeds yes always okay this is our typical soil is uh hardil many har clay L of clay clay and is very very dry we we had one week of snow and uh it help to to make um the soil softer see softer here the farming is biodynamic and the in corn wheat is only planted after long rotation cycle of 5 years of pasture and one year of [Music] beans when you stand at the top of this field and look to the Horizon you realize how clean the environment is and you really understand what matters most here that you can only get from the land what you give back wheat and farming have changed so much over the past Century this is true farming the way it used to be the way it should be larger bigger cheaper it's not better for you or the economy today large scale agriculture means food from patented seeds selected for the highest yields but not for flavor or nutrients supporting Farmers like Leonardo who are devoted to Growing ancient iron corn even though it yields a fifth of modern wheat is so very important this supports your own well-being because food that is lovingly cared for from seed to shelf will nourish your body and your soul"

        "transcript": "[Music] I afid of oh my God oh my God oh my God hey what's up guys this is 9 and you're watching a free-for-all on Prison Break in Call of Duty ghosts and I'm playing on the Xbox one so I'm using the silenced USR here and today I have a bit of a topic well it's more of a question so the question is why do we snipe in Call of Duty why do we quick scope why do we trickshot why do we play so aggressively with sniper rifles instead of a more traditional place a more realistic play style why do we snipe so much instead of using SMGs or assault rifles like me personally I haven't really gotten really into using assault rifles or SMGs for years pretty much since I started sniping I've used sniper rifles 90% of the time or maybe even more than that so why is that the case and why is that the case with so many other people I'm going to attempt to answer that question just for I guess entertainment value and we can we can have a discussion about this in the comments of this video if you'd like or we can talk about it on Twitter at legit meow if you want but anyways let's get into this so first of all the aggressive play style of Call of Duty sniping I think is something that is clearly caught on because it's so effective and it's the most effective way to play with the sniper rifle in my opinion with the size of the maps in Call of Duty which makes traditional or realistic sniping a bit impractical yes you can snipe in a realistic way yes you can camp and lay down in the back of the map and snipe and you can do fairly well and you can get your kill streaks easily and call in your kill streaks and get a ton of kills with those but it kind of goes against the grain and it's a weird way to play in such a fast-paced game it feels like you're not really involved with what everybody else is doing personally I think the aggressive play style is caught on because it's so much fun it works so well and it feels like how sniping in Call of Duty should be so the next thing is the learning curve I really like the learning curve of sniping not just anybody can pick up a sniper rifle when they've never played a firstperson shooter before and do well with the sniper rifle they're going to do a lot better if they're using an SMG or an assault rifle because you have to practice sniping to get good at it and that's something that I think a lot of people including myself obviously really enjoy the learning curve where you start off really sucking with the sniper rifle and it takes a while to build up uh your skills to be able to do well with the sniper rifle and do just as well as you would be able to do with an an SMG or an assault rifle and then you get other people you're playing against the random people in the lobby getting frustrated when you're doing so well and they try out they try out using a sniper rifle and then they just get slapped because it takes some practice you need to put some time in it into it to get actually good at using a sniper rifle so that's one thing that uh I really enjoy about sniping and I still feel like I can improve my sniping I don't feel like I ever reach a plateau with sniping where I can where I can't get any better I feel like like I watch other people's montages and stuff like that that or I play with other people and see how good they really are and uh it motivates me to try and get better at sniping myself all the time there's always room for improvement uh so the next thing is competition with my friends so it started off with real life friends I guess around Modern Warfare 2 where they would be quick scoping and stuff like that and I was trying to get into it and obviously they were a bit better because they had been doing it for a bit longer than me and now that I've been getting into this YouTube stuff I've been doing it for a few years now I have competition with a whole bunch more people everybody in all the Clans and stuff like that like I see uh people posting their montages they want me to check it out and I'm like damn this guy is really good I need to step up my game so that's that's the thing uh competition with other people trying to stay uh you know on the same level as all my friends I think that's a lot of fun and uh let me know if you guys can relate to any of these things let me know in the comments and if you have any more points about why you like sniping what got you into sniping and why you keep sniping for all this time let me know maybe I miss some things I'm I'm going to keep going here though so the next thing is the excitement of hitting a clip or a trick shot so I I feel like it's the ultimate Adrenaline Rush when you're playing Call of Duty to hit a sick clip or the clip of your life I mean it's an amazing feeling it's something that you can't get just by using a regular gun an SMG or an assault rifle which I this is kind of sappy but it's true right you you feel more adrenaline when you're getting an insane clip with a sniper rifle than pretty much any other instance in Call of Duty or that's at least my experience with it like hitting a six on screen there's not much that can compare to that well I mean people have hit seven on screens I guess that can compare to a six on screen anyways um so the next thing is some people want the stamp of approval of being in a clan and that takes a lot of work so I think some people really enjoy the grind of trying to get into the clan that they've always looked up to and a lot of you guys probably know that the only Clan I've ever been in is dark uh I recently left as some of you may or may not know I haven't been too vocal about it because it was on completely good terms and I'm still friends with everybody there it's just uh I want to focus on my own channel and and do my thing here but the the whole clan thing it's a lot of fun it's not for everybody but it's a lot of work and if you are willing to put in the work it can be a really great experience and it pays off for a lot of people they get to be um you know in in some of the biggest Clans and that's obviously a great experience it's a lot of fun uh so the next thing is putting out a montage and having people you respect or that you've always looked up to give you compliments on your hard work that's an awesome feeling uh like page liked my best of video I thought that was the coolest thing ever even I'm still getting these awesome kind of feelings from sniping uh you know 3 years four years into being a sniper so anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this video I didn't quite get to everything that I wanted to say but anyways you guys can probably add to this list and in the comments down below and if you enjoyed this video leave a like it's always appreciated it only takes 2 seconds to hit that like button and it really helps me out a lot so see you tomorrow with a new video [Music] peace no"

        "transcript": "so we've seen all the Innovations myel have made to allow you to cut accurately with a standard blade however they've gone one step further and developed a whole new blade this is a CeX blade it's effectively two blades join together it's really strong and really rigid if you look at the profile you can see it's tapered it's wider at The Cutting Edge it is at the back this allows you to cut straight and curves really accurately you can see the strength of the blade goes right up into the Tang because of the form of this blade you can use it to cut really accurately with the mael track system so let's have a look at that now the mafel track system has a tongue machined along the length and there's a matching Groove in the base of the jigsaw you can use the two together like that you can see it's not fully supported however the jigsaw comes with a glider and this just snaps into position on the base of the jigsaw and now you can see when I make my straight cut it's fully supported and going to be very much more accurate you can use the parallel guide along with the track you can see the parallel guide is flush to the base of the jigsaw and you can use this in one of three ways again put it over the tongue of of the track and provide support by holding down the parallel guide you can fit the parallel guide over the tongue on the track and cut in the same way again with total support or you can use it with a base plate sitting directly on the work to cut a parallel strip of the side of your workpiece you gain need the parallel guide just flip this open lock it in position slide it into the side of the saw set the width you require lock it up and now make your cut to cut a perfect circle where the edges are vertical and the cut meets perfectly you can again use the parallel guide I slide that out you can see there are two pivot Points contained within it to use the 8 mm one push it into position on the parallel guide we now need to drill an 8 mm hole in the middle of the work piece and also an 8 mm hole to start the cut off slide the guide into position drop the pin into the hole adjust the width you want lock it up tight and now you can make your cut the p1cc features a very clever dust extraction system integrated into the base of the tool on most jigsaws there just a simple blower that pushes the sordas forward on this machine air is generated within the motor itself is channeled through the base and across the face of the blade into this dust extraction port and then down on the length of the base inside so you can use the machine connected to a dust extractor using this connector which just slots into the base however because the extraction is so efficient you can use it without that connection in which case you can use a simple chip deflector to prevent the sawdust being blown up back up against you and that just slots in position like that however if you want to use the machine upside down the sawdust is now being blown up into your face so take out the chip deflector turn it over slot it back in place and now you can work without the sord dust being blown back up at you as you'd expect there's an anti-splinter shoe for tear-free cuts on veneered surfaces and this just slips into to position and presses home the unique feature of about this one though it has a very slight radius so there's positive pressure right up against the blade to ensure that chip free surface there's also a sighting line printed on the anti-splinter shoe to help you line up the cut the p1cc comes with a MAFO Max carrying case so you can keep all the accessories together there's a place for everything the parallel guide the glider the dust extraction connector and deflector a box of blades even a compartment for any small loose items and there's even space for the optional tilting base machine fits in as well and there's room for the cable everything in its place no matter where you're working so that's the P1 CC a truly amazing jigsaw with a range of fantastic [Applause] features that was just one of the unique tools from mafel for more information contact your nearest dealer or log on to the website mafel built by Professionals for professionals"

        "transcript": "hello this is chef john from foodwishes.com with top chef fabio viviani that's right i got to do a private cooking class in aspen last year at the food wine classic it was sponsored by bertoli and chef fabio was showing us the different techniques for cooking with their three different grades of olive oil he made us this incredible breakfast i know it doesn't look like breakfast but it was a delicious seared steak with avocado feta roasted tomatoes so good and better than the food listening to chef fabio talk i could listen to this guy all day very entertaining very engaging teacher in fact here he is pontificating on molecular gastronomy when you eat something that tastes like bacon but it's powdered or is a short bill it's a shot of blt or you know it's flavor they're amazing it's a revelation the technique but sometimes it's really hard to feed yourself with it it's more like when you go to a roller coaster park you know you do it once you can't do it every day right because that's you don't need that every day so what you need every day is something that makes you happy fulfill you as far as eating habits and it's easy enough that it can be replied and cost effective because a lot of people they cannot afford to spend tons of money for groceries now one suggestion that i always have is that buy the best that you can afford don't overdo don't buy something that will just make you broke but if you can invest something think about it life is too short to drink bad wine and eat bad food so what we're trying to do here is that you know in the united states especially for far concerning oil there is a lot of misconception meaning that till few days back everything we hear from the food networks from the people on the blog book everything is that everything has to be done with olive oil because extra virgin olive oil is the best extra virgin olive oil is the most nutritious eggs i agree now extravagant olive oil is the most refined out of the oil olive oil category you know very little acidic very little very strong oily flavor but it has to be used in certain situations and only those all right and then it was on to the cooking shafabio was explaining his choices for using the three different olive oils for the pan of roasted cherry tomatoes that he's doing right on the stove top he's using the classic olive oil all right that's the medium body for the searing of the steaks because that is a high heat technique he's using the light olive oil which has the highest smoke point he also threw in some green onions there and wilted those in the hot pan so good all right so after everything was cooked fabio explained that now he would break out the extra virgin to dress his avocado and feta salad which would be used to garnish the plates use it at the end because it's when you look for the smell and the taste of olive excavation is the most intense flavor robust flavor of olive through the category of olive oil that we have and it has to be used at the end or you're gonna lose the reason why you're using it which is the flavor and the intensity now smell it smell you smell the olive oil and then you put it all together now i hear chef fabio is teaching classes down in his restaurant in southern california so i'll provide a link to that if those classes are even half as entertaining as our morning here i highly recommend checking it out and then to make it even more fabulous he finished with a nice aged balsamic vinegar it was really really good and then as we enjoyed those beautiful plates of food chef fabio went into a little bit about what he's looking forward to in sort of the next phase of his career what i'm trying to do now is to build a business with the restaurant industry before was all about getting good reviews on food now is about letting people understand what food and italian culture is about you know i don't like i don't care anymore about the two-star michelin or the fence review because it's not what we're doing anymore you know now we try to please as many people as possible making them understand what's worth it was not you know i don't see myself for 16 hours a day in a kitchen in a single restaurant i'm more seeing myself expanding myself with the passion that we have for the things that we do all right and that was it if you're a top chef fan and a fabio fan like i am i hope you found that entertaining and hopefully one day i'll actually put that recipe together in a food wish video and you can get all the amounts and make that at home all right anyway go to the site for more info and as always enjoy"

        "transcript": "hey everybody it's Jason bla here and it's time for part three of the Monday Q&A so let's get it done first question how are you able to wait through the Bro Science that people teach in gems and get a hold of methods that work for you when you started lifting and didn't have access to the internet for example what keep you from eating only clean foods and working out 6 days a week as a Natty well I'm only 30 7 the internet was pretty much out as I was reaching adulthood it just wasn't as big as it is today the amount of content was much much smaller but there were actually forums that actually talked in depth about steroids and bodybuilding and everything else even back in the late 90s believe it or not right around the the new Millennial so that being said the information was pretty bad I had access to enough strength and conditioning information and legitimate coaches that a lot of training I got a lot of really good stuff early on that help but as far as nutrition because even a lot of nutritionists and sports nutritionists out there were very very bro and were talking about six meals a day and low glycemic index carb that was actually part of mainstream nutrition and mainstream Sports Nutrition at one time it's just that it's died out as new information has come out it's not that it wasn't actually preached by the legitimate experts at one time so at one time was I eating brown rice and chicken for six meals a day yeah have I ever used cycling ketogenic diets for long periods of time guilty so the the reality is I didn't avoid it you guys today with the access to information that you have now you're the on who should be able to avoid this better than we could when I was younger we didn't have access to nearly as much really good nutrition data and nutritional science that you guys have access to today so you guys don't have nearly the excuse I mean back then it was pretty bad but the training was was pretty good because training there was good training information if anything the training online has regressed and is worse than the information that was available back then you guys have got [\u00a0__\u00a0] training info now for the most part but the nutrition has gotten better but we had access to a lot better training information back then at least I did because again I new legitimate coaches and legitimate phds and uh physiology and things but the nutrition info was just terrible and it was way more bous in general than it is right now all right next question when they hold bodybuilding shows in obscure Eastern European countries is it due to higher availability of drugs for the competitors um uh what yeah just just because you can walk in and buy stuff off the shelf doesn't mean the availability is there the the actual availability is lower cuz you go into a pharmacy and there's only four freaking drugs you can buy you go to a country like the United States Canada the UK that has a very very big black market you have access to 37 different drugs anybody can get them if you're you're at the point where you're competing you probably know 17 steroid dealers personally so you don't have any problems whatsoever getting your hands on virtually anything you want at that point I could walk into any new state inside the US and probably find anything I was looking for inside of a week guaranteed if I even if I had never lived there before it's just not that hard so there's them hosting them there I don't know as far as why they're doing it for political reasons I have no idea but I don't think it has anything to do with the availability of drugs because the availability isn't any better all right next question how do you explain some people can't even sit in a chair or box to learn a squat movement I work in a gym and I found more and more people that can't do basic movements like bending over with a straight back or sitting on an inclin leg press is this dude a lack of flexibility oh yeah it's lack of flexibility lack of Mobility it's people having desk jobs and being sedentary for 15 or 20 years it screws you up bad the only thing you can do for these people is mobility work and a good trainer this is unfortunately why I would never want to be a personal trainer to the mainstream public and work with non-athletes cuz you got to spend a month or two just getting these people mobile enough and flexible enough to do basic physical movements that's how bad the average American is it's it's really really bad and again it has to do with a lifetime of no physical activity and being completely sedentary or if they're not sedentary they have a physical IAL job that creates a muscle or Mobility IM balance through repetitive movements and not actually balancing things out so that's your big issue there that is a cause and it it's quite a hassle for new people training out and it's something that personal trainers is pretty much their main job is to get people mobile again and most of the new clients they have to work with them in order to get them to even be able to function enough to even start lifting weights correctly all right guys that's really all I have to say on that today I hope it has been informative and I will talk to you guys next time in part four"

        "transcript": "hey guys how's it going Toby here welcome back to a brand new video here on my Channel today we have got a pack opening for you guys there is a pretty crazy team of the week for like the third week in a row it's been a good few team of the weeks lately and I cannot resist opening up a few packs now before we get started if you're looking for a place to get some coins check the link in the description for the fifas shop. UK an awesome little website and if you use the code toby1 you get a discount of every single one of your orders when you're at the checkout so these were just some 7.5k backs and I wanted to see if we could get an inform it's been like I think it's been since January since we got an inform so it's been a really really long time let me know if you guys have got anything awesome and any suggestions for perhaps some pink slips for this week leave them in the comment section down below as well that would be fantastic and I'd really like some help because in the last pack opening I did I had an idea to do like this connect funny video series and I really really want to do it because it would be so funny like I've had some before by accidentally deleted them where people would be like raging or shouting or even singing and I'd be in like hysterics while was playing FIFA and they're so so funny so if you can by any chance find some or have some of your own that you've recorded of people being funny overc connect in your games just send them to me on Twitter I'd love to make a little like either top five or just a showcase video of them all it'd be so so funny so if you have have any like connect funny moments send me them on Twitter I think it would be absolutely hilarious it make for a really funny series I could like edit it down and throw in some sound effects and loads of random stuff it' be it' be good so if you have any Clips just send me them on Twitter that would be that would be good that would be really really funny and another one is I asked if you wanted to see like a vie's Road to Glory the legend card that is Christian Vier and a lot of you said yes but the only downside to that is I wouldn't be able to do as many Squad bus because I wouldn't have the coins to do so so would you guys just like a start from scratch Road to Glory like it can either be just randomly playing either in online single matches working our way up to get something or it could be like a race to division one I think the divisions would be more of a a focus for the series which would be pretty cool it's a long series because there's now 10 divisions is that something that kind of interests you like there could be different teams for each division there could be ways to work you guys into the series if you really wanted to but let me know what you think because I'd love to do VI's Road to Glory the only thing is that's then 560 OD th000 coins from my main account into a second account it's a bit of a pain cuz then I can't have as many awesome squads like at the moment I've got about 560k I think and I can do some pretty good squads like the more expensive is ones using some of the players that perhaps I haven't used yet so let me know what you think because a normal Road to Glory is something I've done before but people kind of got a little bit Bard and then I got a little bit board so we' need a way to make it really interesting and maybe like a race to division one would be quite cool and perhaps showing you some tips and tricks along the way if you guys wanted and again if there's any tutorials that you can think of like leave them down in the comment section because I plan on doing a stepover roulette like skill combo that seems like a good one to do and then if I'm doing a mcti spin one as well because those three skill moves are probably some of the most effective I might do the scoop turn as well like the running scoop turn and things like that so they are all coming in the future can I wait to do more of those I really really enjoyed doing the tutorials but just let me know any suggestions down below and let me know how your luck has been with this team of the week if you've got any but that pretty much wraps up the video I hope you have enjoyed it if you did leave a like And subscribe for some more but thank you so so much guys take care have an amazing day and goodbye"

me to open it did you see it no I just took it Maxi I don't want to know this I I I don't want to be the one that gets to decide if Nicholas knows that John is really his [Music] baby no you're better than good you're you're in a class all your own oh you don't have to resort to flatter I already told you I'd keep going flattery implies that I'm being insincere no really when it comes to you every word I say is a truth you're remarkable yeah and she's also married not that I one of you seem to care lucky yeah you spent the last 3 hours with Patrick at the Cosmopolitan and it wasn't the first time you're off base here wait you're right I have been meeting Patrick at the Cosmopolitan for weeks Patrick is treating a patient who lives at the Cosmopolitan Hotel it's a closed head injury that requires private nursing Around the Clock isabeth mentioned she needed extra money so I ranged for her to work for him hours are flexible it pays better than being a floor nurse why did you tell me why did you hide it because you're so stressed about the money right now and you're worried about your sister and your father and and everything else and you're pushing yourself too hard in rehab just to get back to work and you have enough to deal with I didn't want to upset you I'm so sick of you treating me like a child deciding what I am strong enough to know you know this would be the part that you apologize and thank your wife for busting butt to hold your family why is you stay the hell away from my marriage stay the hell away from my wife why didn't you just give this to Nicholas I tried you don't want to know how weird it got that's why I called you because you always know the right thing to do I don't know about that Robin you're the closest thing I have to a big sister and I swear to God when when I opened that envelope the first thing I wanted to do was call Jesse of course you did I know you miss him and he would be able to tell me what to do okay um have you told anyone else just you and I don't plan on telling anyone good don't look I don't want to deal with this anymore okay I don't trust myself with this kind of secret but I trust you Maxi whatever I decide someone is going to get hurt JX adores that baby he's already started to bong with him but that doesn't mean he can take someone else's child and Nicholas is I mean he just lost Courtney he's trying to put his life back together God knows what he'll do if he finds us out Carly all right I have to go back to the beginning think about this like I would any other research project assume nothing maybe Jax doesn't know that Nicholas is the father he knows now oh no I know it was not the right thing to do but I mailed a copy of the test to Jack why would you do that so he would pay to keep me quiet you tried to blackmail him I told you I made a mess of things I am really embarrassed okay why would you try to get money from Jax because Mac took my car away and I wanted another one I don't know I didn't think Jax was going to miss the money look I I can't deal with this anymore please will you take care of it okay I don't want to make things worse than I already have okay okay Nicholas is John's father he deserves to know that that is his son but Jax is my friend he's a good person and he loves that baby so maybe we just don't say anything you know what honestly if Carly wasn't involved in situation I probably would have stayed out of it but with her around I don't think I can trust him to make the right decision hello welcome home hi how's Sam she's good she should be waking up any minute you jet leg no not really I slept on the plane why well in that case I'd love to take you to dinner tonight Sam Mall just woke up I'll be right there uh M met record at 8:30 I can't wait [Music] bye was that Dr Drake never mind me and Dr Drake you need to concentrate on getting your life back together and give yourself time to gate for Jesse I'll try and as far as the secret of Nicholas and his son I'll figure out what to do [Music] okay how am I I do good work what was wrong with me anyway you suffered an intra cerebral edema with proximal spinal cord compression ouch is that as bad as it says worse but you're alert and coherent your pupils are even and reactive you don't seem to have suffered any nerve damage so should make a full recovery does Jason know I'm about to tell her test results are good she's reacting excellent she should make a full recover you can thank me at any time I have great appreciation for your skill Dr Drake it's just your bedside manner with the patient family that could use a little work excuse me take a white water rafting in the next 24 hours but you don't have to treat her with kid gloves she's out of danger I would give you some advice so be honest with her about everything that happened it'll help Sam be less disoriented if she knows the [Music] truth you looking for me welcome back so what kind of wine we looking at something to celebrate being out of the jungle you pick is there a good reason why you're not paying any attention to me right now there's some people here tonight that I would prefer to avoid oh things were so much easier in the jungle you can be a little more specific I found something out that I'm not supposed to know and I would prefer not to deal with it tonight then don't I'm sorry glad to see you glad to see you too did you miss [Music] me desperately let's get out of here her room's downstairs I know you won't be the first girl in history to go to the prom with her brother perfect timing Robin is leaving you know her lectures on truth and morality can sure put a damper on the what do you have you know what Carly you pull the same hateful crap over and over again I'm not going to let you get away with it"

        "transcript": "today I'm doing a video on spin tech mufflers anytime you talk about chambered mufflers particularly flowmaster spin Tech's come up to conversation now spit tech mufflers have been available in the market since maybe the earlier mid 1990s they are invented by the gentleman who goes by the nickname of dr. gas he has a history of building components for NASCAR and also had a little history in rocket science just to make it simple if you were cut of spin Tec muffler in half it looks like this you kind of have a whole bunch of curly cubes and that is how the muffler works see there's this theory of thermal dynamics that they use and it's true as you increase a heat energy thermal energy in a system there's an increase in entropy are the randomness of the molecules when something is cold the molecules kind of form neatly compact groups similar to something that you would see in a solid so it's easy for sound ways to travel through them it acts almost like if it wasn't amplify our speaker as you increase heat energy the molecules have their own agenda they want to move out in all different directions sound waves can't easily be transferred the molecules aren't right next to each other they have their own agendas on what they want to do so that's how the sound is in a way cancel their muffled you see air goes in the exhaust gas goes in through one side gets scooped up in the curlicues almost like if there were some sort of all over and as they get scooped around they spin around hence spin tech go to a little bit of a dead end I'm sure probably some cancellation works there some sound energy gets converted to physical energy in the wall the curl but you have these little perforations here these little holes almost like something you would see in a glass pack and that's where the exhaust gas escapes because it can't go through a dead end it goes out through here and the interesting thing is not all the exhaust gas gets sucked up in these little curls some of it goes around the outside and when it does that it pushes air out of the way and creates a vacuums create and creating essentially what is it exhaust gas scavenging so the theory behind spin tech is that it's going to allow your car to generate more performance than other chambered muffler designs because many chambered muffler designs are general muffler designs hit a back wall they hit some sort of a wall a flat edge and the exhaust is forced to go in all different weird directions a spin tech is supposed to allow the exhaust to have a clear path and at the same time using different principles and constriction or absorption to fully muffle noise and of course there's some constriction going here with these little perforations but the idea is that it's thermal energy it's the more randomness of this system more randomness of the molecules that's supposed to be creating a muffled noise now when the interest you think about spin text is nowadays they actually build mufflers to your specifications you want to muffler in a weird shape weird design whatever it is just tell them what you want and they will make it for you which is something I really really like not to also mention that they're also made in USA spit tec mufflers have an old-school design kinda like the original flowmasters their box mufflers they're welded rectangular boxes they're not round they're built pretty heavy-duty from what people say you can actually see a lot of the weld marks on their mufflers in fact you can kind of see what the inside the muffler looks like from the outside based on the welding patterns there's all of her types of designs all different numbers of curlicue shapes the curlicues their locations it all depends on whatever application it is and they build mufflers for all different series of racing and all that type of stuff now an interesting thing about these spin Tech's is that they're also available now in stainless steel which helps them be a little bit more reliable than some of the other muffler designs out there but spin Tech's I have to say for my personal experience they kind of making unique noise I'm not saying it's a bad noise they actually like it it's kind of raspy at higher rpms and at lower rpms it kind of has that low pea idle sound and I can attribute that to just the extreme randomness in all the different directions the exhaust gas has to go in to get through this chamber here on this muffler now spintax it when it gets it to that the whole you know topic of performance is it good or is it bad you know I can't declaratively say I've never personally you know dyno test anything with different types of mufflers but what I do know is that you compared to some other muffler designs out there your mainstream muffler designs you know it might be a good thing it has a lot less baffles to bounce into and the baffles that are there are rounded the course once again the exhaust has to go through like I said all these different weird directions it gets scooped up pushed through perforations all different silly business so it may be it's one of those mufflers that it just produces a nice exhaust noise that you like and want to put on your car anyway that's the general aspect of how a spin tech muffler works take"

safely pass right by me do not want to get hit by that RCXD the RCXD is very abunai and I do not want to get blown up by that [\u00a0__\u00a0] so oh get on baby get a nice little drop shot with my scuff controller and guys I've been just drop shotting like crazy look at me just low I'm low all the time staying low staying hard to hit this scuff controller dude is completely transform my game I mean I when people are sending you messages after your games accusing you of cheating or hacking or modding and you're playing legit you know you're doing something right man and uh the scuff controller I will never go back to using an Xbox uh 360 standard controller the Scuf has completely ruined me spoiled me for that and uh it's like I said man the last Uh custom controller I bought was that mad cats Modern Warfare 2 controller you guys remember that thing oh my God Son uh yeah this scuff is nothing like that this is legit and uh guys I got some new gaming equipment oh that nade almost takes me out but I got some new equipment guys I'm going to link all the stuff in the description so you can check it out and see right there if I didn't drop shot that guy he probably would have killed me if I didn't drop shot him but I got the drop on him literally and I'm going to push up right here I pick up this gold MP5 K NASA one style e double drop shot [\u00a0__\u00a0] e NASA one E I run the greatest podcast in the world e spawn trap podcast hey guys I don't know if you've listened to NASA's spawn trap podcast but I listen to it the first time I'm actually embarrassed to say cuz NASA's my boy but I'm just a busy dude I can't be listening to all these podcasts that you guys got going on but I did check out NASA's spawn trap podcast the other night I thought it was great look at this guy right here come on son come on where's this guy at oh sit down baby MP5K for the win oh guy was a fascist too so he got the Nazi symbol oh all right so I slay that fascist and I'm going to push up right here what do we got spray this guy down and I get tricked by the Blackbird yet again when the Black Bird's in its end phase it's almost like a joke I thought that guy was a lot farther back than he was but yeah the when the black bird Fades away at the end it kind of It kind it can trick you sometimes it really can which sucks but you know whatever I already picked up my dogs no big deal yeah I'm going to push up right here see I get some hit indicators and yep there's a guy right there there's that fascist I slay him again and let's see what do I want to do what do I want to do do I want to go right do I want to go left I think I'm going to go oh think I'm going to drop shot I'm going to drop shot with the Scuf and I I'll play that fast just yet again and oh sit out son look at this bam [\u00a0__\u00a0] oh the loyal Patriot himself would be proud of that RPG how did that guy know I was going to go over there man he must have saw the skulls from his teammates oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] I got raped all right so I'm going plant this Claymore down guys and at this juncture of all junctures El pre style I'm going to look for a place to get in my Chopper Gunner but I'm not feeling it man I'm not just just like no place to really hide in that arcade so I get the hell out of there and yeah right now I'm just so indecisive I don't know if I want to call in my Chopper right here I don't know what I want to do but I know there's people in this little house right here so I'm going to rush in and oh ghost [\u00a0__\u00a0] in the corner there's my boy there's my boy was that a Galil that had to be a silenced Galil so so I take out ghost [\u00a0__\u00a0] in the corner I slay that Nazi again and yeah now I'm going to get up on my Chopper Gunner guys I'm not going to play any Chopper Gunner music just because this is a real quick gameplay I think I jump in here and I pick up like 30 kills in 4 minutes pretty damn good uh for Team Deathmatch standards anyway so uh yeah guys I got some new gaming equipment man you know what you guys know I got the scuff controller I got this um Asus monitor it's the same monitor that the MLG tryhards use uh so it's supposed to have like some 2 Ms you know response time got really low lag input and it's supposed to be really good for gaming so what the hell it's a tax write off for your boy anyway since I'm a Machin a premier director oh not a premier director what was I thinking I'm not a premier director but I am a respawn director so it's all attack right off for your boy anyway so I figured I'd go all out get a nice gaming monitor I'm going to link all the new equipment I bought in the description so you guys can check it out out let me know did I make a smart choice did I make a dumb choice and if you guys are following my nc2a tournament brackets you guys know I don't always make smart choices but anyway it's your boy Thunder hope you enjoyed this video please don't forget to rate it and I'm

        "transcript": "hey guys today we're going to be talking about what a lot of you guys have been waiting for and that's the electric wiring of this layout now be patient with me because I'm going to have to divide this into segments of videos on how to wire a layout because it's very complex uh but today we're going to get in an introduction of wiring and just keep in mind that my layout is not the same as your layout so a lot of the wiring is going to have to be improvised if you have different layout than I have or you're going to have to get in the books and do the research yourself Model Railroader has a book for uh DCC wiring and there's a lot of online resources for DCC wiring so a lot of it is interpretive to what you've got going on on your layout I've got my layout with a double oval you know if you got something like that you can probably be able to figure it out I've also got modules so I've made some uh different steps that I've taken that some people may not take uh but we'll go over that but just like with a track uh when you're laying out the track you need a track plan you kind of need a wiring schematic or diagram so you know what you're doing now for me I'm red green color blind so being under the table under dark light I can't really see the difference between red and green colors so I'm using black and yellow for my uh wires now you need to pick a wire and keep it with a side of rail for example um I'm going to have yellow rail on or yellow wire on the outside rail of each one of these and black wire on the the inside of rail never switch them or you're going to have problems so that's the first thing that you got to keep aware of when you're doing wiring now I was talking about the diagrams let's go ahead and take a look at what we have here uh now this is an example uh where they've used blue and orange I've got uh yellow and black so just make sure one color goes to these uh jumpers here or to these uh block terminals or barrier strips I'm sorry so all these screw uh boxes here with screws in them those are called barrier strips and we're going to go over that uh but this is basically what it's going to look like under on the underside of my table here on this wiring diagram uh if you need to pause the video to look at it closer feel free to do so but you've got pink for the uh barrier strip jumpers and you've got uh outer rail in this case is orange inner rail is blue I'm just going to modify it to my which is uh yellow and black like I said so now that we've shown you that let's go over some things that you're going to need now I'm using these because I'm not much of a soldering guy I hate soldering um so what I'm going to be able to do with these is just simply run the wire under these screws under these metal tabs here and uh screw it down and that will create a connection in between the screw and the metal tab so as you can see this here fits perfectly in with my diagram with these eight post uh strips here now you can pick these up at Radio stack they're called Eight position dual row barrier strips and in my case I need six of them so I've got six ready to go ordered off radioshack.com and then on the diagram you see these smaller uh barrier strips they are called two position dual row barrier strips and you can see them here and they are located on there on the diagram and I need 12 of those so actually 13 because I've got to to make the connection to my controller so I've got these uh old model R ring trick I've told you guys before about is telephone wire you can uh order on radioshack.com indoor outdoor telephone wire 24 gauge you open it up and gut it out and you've got the wires in there you've got the red and green which I can't hardly tell and then you've got the black and yellow which is what I've decided to use so you've got those wires uh this is a cheap way to get a good amount of wire you're just going to have to cut off the amounts you need and gut this out to get to the wires you need but they're pretty durable wires you have in here and you won't need to be doing anything to them here are the barrier strips I was talking or the uh jumpers I was talking about we're going to have to cut these in half because they cannot be they can't be touching each other on the same uh barrier strip when we have our electric wiring going on because there's a positive and a negative side and they can't be connected or we're going to get a short or the signal DCC signal is just not going to travel you obviously need a good pair of wire strippers I don't know what brand this is uh but these are my favorite I have this other set that's really crappy so going to need a set of wire strippers uh to strip the wire down to get to the metal as it's insulated into a little casing you've got to get to the bare metal so you can connect it to your be your uh Burger strips and then in my case another thing uh like I said it may be exclusive just to me is you need crimp on Spade tongues or Spade connectors now this is I'm going to connect basically this connector to the wire itself after this insulation is off only module to module so when I go to move I can easily disconnect these and I don't have wires hanging out everywhere and when I you know get to my new location I can put them back together that makes for a good solid uh movable layout for me to uh work with every time I move it's not crazy disconnections everywhere wires flying around everywhere and another thing try to keep your wires organized try to keep them grouped together with zip ties if you can uh there's going to be this bus line once again on the diagram that the line the bus line runs the connections from one barrier strip to another and that goes all the way around and you have to keep it uh on its appropriate side so if it's outer rail you got to keep it on one side and inner rail you got to keep it on the other side so and then those Spade connectors on this other diagram here you can see are going to be uh on connections that I need to easily disconnect when I need to move so basically in between modules is where those Spade connectors are going to be in my case so keep all that in mind when you're doing your uh electric wiring I'll be starting this wiring process uh step by step the simplest way for me to I figure to do it is I'm going to go ahead and get some double-sided tape or maybe Mount these things since they have screw holes on the underside of my layout just the way this diagram looks I'm going to mount these strips exactly where they need to be and this one is actually going to have to be on one table or the other it can't be in the center but uh this one barrier strip here but I'm going to mount those up and then I'm going to work on the wiring so this next video I will have all these barrier strips mounted in place and we will start wiring one to one uh to make sure that this is done correctly so thanks for watching keep watching as we go through this and please be patient with me because I'm trying to get this done quickly so I haven't really gotten into video editing software uh I've got some on order but I don't have time to cut scene and stuff like that so I'm going to have to do video of uh break it down one by one so you're seeing it step by step per video so there's going to be probably three four maybe five videos just on wiring thanks for watching see you next time"

        "transcript": "what is going on everyone my name is zimar and today I'm going to be bringing you guys a Monumental piece of news that you have all been waiting for and it is that T12 is in finally is finally in certification now unfortunately um there is no release date as of yet but if you guys don't know certification can take up to 10 business dayses so the last possible date that um certification or that'll be in Microsoft certification would be the 23rd of August so it either be out before the 23rd of August or on the 23rd of August or someday like the 26th of August which I could see it possibly being out then but I think it won't take up to 10 business days for certification cuz they've been bug fixing on it for a while so I think they seem to be pretty confident that it'll be released soon who knows maybe it will even come out next week but if you guys are excited for T12 then be sure to click that like button cuz I know I am excited but um I'm not going to be reading off every single thing I'm going to include the entire change list down below in the description along with a link to where I found this information so you guys are like not like scumbag esimo you're just lying to us for subs and Views no I'm not guys cuz this is absolutely huge but um you know we got some new Mobs we know we already knew about ocelot cats and iron golems but we are getting baby villagers this pretty much means that uh villagers will be able to have babies little babies if there is room inside of their village now new items include redstone lamp jungle wood stairs jungle wood half slab jungle wood blocks jungle wood planks jungle tree slings uh ocelate spawn eggs and in creative mode only we have chiseled stone bricks so unfortunately that's creative mode only so in 23 it'll probably be added to survival as well uh but um creative mode only as well we have the mob heads which are skeleton wither heads zombie humans and creepers so unfortunately like I said that is creative mode only but as for some changes and additions we have um a new tutorial world have a new map height 256 instead of 128 blocks high we have some jungle biomes jungle trees cocoa beans grow on jungle trees so uh instead of being found in like abandoned M shafts and dungeon chest and stuff like that we'll be able to see cocoa beans growing on trees so we can have some cocoa bean Farms as well which is definitely pretty cool now besides that we have slabs and stairs being able to be ped upside down added Corner stairs and upside down Corner stairs also we have some 3D dropped items in now this is where it's going to get into the stuff that we don't know about and it's stuff that I've pretty much predicted to you guys so I've been pretty much spot on with my predictions besides um chiseled Sandstone slap or chiseled sandstone and uh stuff like that coming I was wrong about that I was wrong about smooth sandstone and chisel sandstone and carpet so I'm wrong I'm sorry about that but I've been pretty right about other stuff as well so I've been about you know I've been about half and half with my guests is on this so I'm not a complete scumbag Eskimo but here we go guys um dispensing boats and Minecarts are added to the dispenser you know you got some new ambient cave Sounds new cave sounds you can hear the the the call of the Eskimo that that's that's a bird that's not an Eskimo and Eskimo is like do you guys want some fish but besides that guys we're going to be getting back into the changes list and uh the crafting recipe for ladds now yield three ladders instead of just two so that is definitely awesome uh if you place a block on grass it will replace it and lava now has a faint rumbling sound effect and large part particles that hop out of lava produce a popping sound so lava has a different sound so that's definitely going to be um awesome for you guys who play uh survival un like the sound hord and you're like where are see diamonds I must find Z diamonds and Z lava so I can find Z diamonds and that will definitely help you find lavva and be able to find more diamonds as well uh we're going to be getting back into the change list as well now this is well pretty much where it definitely gets really awesome I don't think I covered this uh part I don't think I covered uh zombie sieges or zombies being able to break down doors in hardcore mode if I did I'm sorry about that I don't remember saying it but I did predict that so I did predict that we were getting zombie sieges in T12 so I was spot on about that unfortunately there is no hardcore mode but we you know Zombie Siege is definitely still pretty cool but um you know we're going to have some very rare desert Wells can be found in desert biomes along with the maximum amount of boats in the world being increased to 40 I know you can only have eight people in boats at a time so why you'll need 40 is beyond me but uh you seven other people and 32 imaginary people can have a party in boats you can seeing I'm on a boat that' definitely be pretty cool I guess some Minecraft ities coming soon to you but um when you are in the nether Snow Golems will melt and die the same time as they do well die the same as they do in desert biomes now abandoned M shafts can generate with wooden bridges now when generated over a cave or over top of another tunnel now doors have been updated added not up updated not added doors have been updated so that double doors work better with redstone so that's definitely awesome for all you Redstone enthusiasts but here's is some new stuff as well now um added the favorite tabs to the skin selector menu storing most recently used skins so that's definitely really awesome so I don't know how many skins that can store at a time but recently skins you have used hopefully Parker Steve cuz you are a ESC well an escob brro hopefully use that skin you know it'll be stored in there for you guys to go back to if you guys want to go to another skin from say another skin pack so that is definitely really awesome now the the last change or change for T12 is um texture pack support and master packs and the display of these in the Minecraft store now we all knew about this coming in T12 and that pretty much covers everything besides a few fixes but if you guys would like to read on I will be including a link to where I found all of this information Down Below in the description along with um all of these changes and fix is inside of T12 Down Below in the description as well besides the link so if you guys don't want to go

Even when I try to be objective it doesn't seem real. Of course, there's no doubt that I've been lucky. But the fact remains that I won and I'm still here. I'll accept that and do my best. Some people are just happy to be on TV. But I want to see everyone's happy face when I win. I hate the way I fight now. Even when I get hit, I go forward and hit back. But that's the best way to win. I've never seen such a strong fighter. Petrosyan knows that winning means not losing. He bites and I'll bite back. In a world only the both of us understand. That's cool. My body is craving something sweet. I have to be patient, but I feel sorry for my body. I always fight for the people who support me. I can't forget them when I'm in the ring. Whenever I hear my entry music I can feel tears welling up. Everyone says stuff like that, so I didn't want to say that. But that's how I feel.

        "transcript": "hi yeah Johnny leg Sutton from sunshine and stars here to all the line dancers out there uh you might find when you first started that it's a little bit or inspiring but all it really is is a selection of modern dance steps put together and made into a line dance so what I'm going to do is just go through the basic line dance steps for you okay first step is a grape vine and I will show you that right now okay this is a right grap Vine with a touch left grae Vine with a touch now grae Vines can finish in various ways that one was with a touch it can be with a hitch it can be with another hitch it can be with a stomp so that is a great Vine next step is a toast  as the name implies that's a forward one and a back tow strut it's a tow strut coming up now is a heel strut heel heel it's a nice strut bit of attitude that is a heel strut this next very popular step is a jazz box now if those of you can remember the days of the Shadows basic one as you see the Shadows do you can do a left one or you can do a turning one a quarter turn so if somebody says to you quarter turn jazzbox that's exactly what it is so that's your chz box next on the list is a Monteray this is a quarter turning one so it's quarter turn recover and again quarter turn replace recover and again quarter turn replace recover you can do a half turn of course half turn replace recover half turn replace recover that's a Monteray a heel dig basic dig or if you want to do a double dig dig dig replace dig dig replace left heel dig dig that's a heel dig a heel grind it's a method of turning it as it as it says heel grind replace left one heel grind replace heel grind replace a rocking chair you rock forward recover and rock back Rock forward recover Rock back left rocking chair rock forward recover Rock back so it's a rocking chair so now we're going to do a weave so you're just going sideways weave and you can keep going or if you're going the other way weave left right left right right left right so it's right behind right in front right behind right in front and the same the other way so that is a weave this next one is a coaster step coaster step can be done left or right and it can be done forwards or back but I'll do a backward right one first back together forward and again back together forward a left one back together forward a forward one forward together back a left one forward together back that is a coaster step and now a mambo step this can be done forward backwards or to the side right or left so a forward Mano step a forward right MBO step is forward and together that's a MBO step forward and together a left man step forward and together side right side and together side left side and together back back and together left back and together that's a mambo step this one is a scissor step this can be right or left another name for this is a cross Mambo step but it's step out step together step across so it's a scissor scissor step step out step together step across a left one step out step together step across right one step out step together step across step out step together step across that is a scissor step a sailor step just imagine uh the sailor's horn pipe this is a sailor step sailor step think of the drunken sailor sailor step sailor step if you think of the hornpipe that is a sailor step this time it's going to be a shuffle it can be done right left or forward and back so I'll do a right forward Shuffle and it's as the name implies Shuffle Shuffle back Shuffle forward Shuffle back that is a shuffle block step which is very similar to a shuffle except again as the name implies you're locking one foot behind the other it can be forward or back step lock step a right forward One Step lock step and if you're doing a back one a back right one step lock step forward left step lock step back left step lock step so that's a step lock step this is a chass you can do left or right right chass chass and normally finishes with a rock back recover left chass chass it really is just a sideway Shuffle so that is a chassis next we're going to do a rumble box again it can be done forward or back left or right so this is a right forward Rumble box side together forward side together back a rear runber box going backwards side together back side together forward that is a rumber box once you've mastered these few basic

        "transcript": "this rubio brought to you by sonic hiphop.com sonic with a k hello this is ron paul with your weekly update for monday march 4th the sequester crisis and what should be done despite what the media and politicians would have us believe the united states did not collapse last friday when the package of spending reductions known as sequestration went into effect the financial markets hardly blinked as they have come to be more skeptical about these periodic government hype crisis what had been portrayed as a drastic reduction in government spending was merely a decrease in the projected rate of increase in government spending over the next decade under sequestration government spending increases by 2.4 trillion over the next 10 years rather than the 2.5 trillion dollars without it so we are speeding toward collapse at only 100 miles per hour instead of 110 miles per hour some in congress are using the panic over sequestration to justify another surrender of legislative authority to the executive branch these members want to pass the buck on prioritizing federal programs by giving the president cabinet officials and high-level bureaucrats authority to set spending priorities however it is congress's job to set priorities in federal spending the drafters of the constitution give the legislature the authority over spending because they recognized it was a threat to liberty to allow this power to be concentrated in the executive branch congress's willingness to cede more authority to the executive should be opposed by everyone who values liberty and limited government some of the loudest objections to sequestration have come from the champions of the military industrial complex yet under sequestration defense spending will still increase by 18 over 10 years as opposed to 20 percent without sequestration there are claims that the military will face a one-time real reduction back to the 2007 levels of spending before beginning to climb again next year that remains to be seen however few claimed at the time that the 2007 levels of military spending occurring as they did during the huge post 911 buildup were inadequate but despite the fact that the us spends more on military than the rest of the world combined we are told that even this modest short-term reduction would be in the words of outgoing defense secretary leon panetta shameful and irresponsible a return to the 1980s level of military spending in real dollars a time of significant military buildup is considered outrageous even though the u.s faces no soviet union or equivalent threat in fact the entire amount is supposed to save is could be realized by cutting one unneeded wasteful boondoggle the 1.5 trillion dollar f-35 fighter program the f-35 built as the next generation all-purpose military fighter and bomber has been an unmitigated disaster its performances in recent tests have been so bad that the pentagon has been forced to dumb down the criteria it is overweight overpriced and unwieldy it is also an anachronism we no longer face the real prospect of air-to-air combat in this area of fourth generation warfare the mustang the p-51 the longest-range fighter in the world the world war ii mid-air dogfight era is over as defense analyst winslow wheeler wrote last year it's time for defense secretary leon panetta the u.s military service and congress to face the facts the f-35 is an unaffordable mediocrity and the program will not be fixed by any combination of hardware tweaks or cost control projects there is only one thing to do with the f35 we should not look for cancellation of the f-35 program anytime soon however the military-industrial complex understands the political necessity of spreading its military keynesianism as widely across the congressional districts as possible despite the rhetoric there's appears no intention on the part of the government to take our fiscal crisis seriously or abandon the idea that we should run the rest of the world this radio brought to you by sonic hiphop.com sonic with a k hip hop and urban media production for the liberty community vids graphics top quality tunes the humble riddler report can't even begin to do justice to their quality so check them out where they are sonic hiphop.com sonic with a k"

        "transcript": "boxing is the trendy new workout these days gyms are popping up all around the Bay Area there are obvious risks with this sport and if trainers ignore the safety rules lives are on the line dan noise is here with an i-team investigation and dan last night you investigated private shows with underage boxers and it\u00eds they don't the adults tonight that's right dan and Carolyn you know it's a very simple the rules for amateur boxing state before anyone puts on the gloves and throws a punch at a person or takes a punch they have to be certified it's an important process with several steps to ensure safety but too often the rules are being ignored and one San Francisco family knows how costly mistakes can be boxing is a very popular workout at bay area gems not just what would be champions but for soccer moms and young professionals in the rush to cash in some gyms are not following the safety rules set up by the sports governing body USA boxing Jerry Maxwell there's of Northern California president before I throw a punch at someone and before I take a punch is there step that has to happen absolutely what is the set mainly it be licensed you have to have a book a person gets this license only after an experienced trainer concludes the fighter is ready for battle that shows the fighter is insured to compete and that a doctor has approved the person as being healthy enough to take a punch amateur fighters as young as 8 have to go through the process and if they're older in their 30s or 40s the rules are even more stringent they have to undergo an extra battery of tests it's kind of like a what they call a masters division where you have to go to neurological and and everything but it's very few people to do that all that didn't happen with Keith Benjamin almost every conversation with Keith started with some kind of a conversation that related to his family Benjamin was married with two young children a successful venture capitalist when he took up boxing at the age of 46 he tried to get his friend and business partner steve larson to join him he said well word you should come to the gym with me why don't you get back into it I said no I'm not interest it's a brutal sport it in it it is very demanding physically Benjamin completed a six-week boot camp at San Francisco's third Street Gym the graduation ceremony of three round belt in September 2005 from the beginning it was clear Benjamin was overmatched he took several solid shots to the head after he got knocked down the coach let the fight continued more punishment until they finally stopped the fight his trainer took Benjamin to the hospital where doctors confirmed he had suffered a concussion after a Benjamin wrote in his blog I would have liked to win the fight I need more experience in the ring to get fully past the fear and build confidence in my fighting skills however I don't think it's worth the risk of more concussions at my age flash forward almost three years to this past July Keith Benjamin is back at third street gym working out when he goes down and never gets back up this is so wrong this is just so wrong he is them probably one of the most alive people that I'd ever met and for someone at what I would call it the very prime of his life with a family that's right in the middle of you know being developed it was just wrong it's been difficult for friends and family to find out exactly what happened was there an accident was Keith fighting did he slip and fall the chief official for local boxing spoke with the gym owner he said he thought he passed when he was in training what he told me so what was a sparring did he get hit what happened I don't know I don't know no one's done a serious investigation not USA boxing or the State Athletic Commission staff there only asked some informal questions what was the cause of death I believe from what I known or heard about it it was a something brain aneurysm the owner of third Street Gym Simon Redman refused to be interviewed he's now in Ireland on vacation but he confirmed by phone the Benjamin was sparring when he went down and Benjamin's autopsy report obtained by the i-team shows Keith Benjamin suffered blunt-force trauma he died from a punch to the head it's the only sport that we currently practice where the primary goal of this sport is to cause a head injury dr. Jeffrey manly heads the neuro trauma center at sf General and he operated on Keith Benjamin that day he can't talk about the case because of privacy laws but he says that ninety percent of people who box sustained some type of concussion when I punch your head goes back your brain basically moves back and forth as its floating in this spinal fluid and it essentially smacks the inside of the skull surface the same scene is playing out around the Bay Area people graduate from these boxing boot camps and get thrown into the ring without the proper safety precautions no doctor standing by no ambulance no skilled referee to stop the action and prevent injuries what sort of enforcement do you do I miss someone really watching it snow basic is kind of on the honor system you know there's there's none under not enough resource or time for anybody in association to go around and police one another not when an area as big as we have Ramona Gatto is a world champion kickboxer who now coaches youth boxing on the peninsula she's been pushing for more regulation in the Bay Area boxing scene two guys given the ring and hit each other beat each other up what happened to keep Benjamin can happen to anybody and that is is that you take too much punishment to the head you can die now some might argue the Keith Benjamin should have known better than to take up boxing at his age but the rules are meant to protect people and these students walk into a gym trusting that the coaches know what they're doing and are looking out for their safety the attorney for third Street Gym sent a statement that says in part the owners take the safety and well-being of their clientele very seriously and make every possible effort at all times to comply with the rules"

        "transcript": "welcome to another MP4 Nation player and review today we have the haar pa20 and ladies and gentlemen this player is great uh the packing on the other hand isn't so nice uh well I don't think so anyway uh very thin very slim very plain nothing fabulous uh the player is pretty tightly packed there you go here we have it has a 3.2 in qvga touchscreen before we get to play Let's just check out what accessories come with this you have your standard headphones but these headphones use a 2.5 mm uh audio jack uh MP4 Nation will include with displ for free a 2.5 to 3.5 uh mm headphone jack converter so you can attach your standard headphones that you may have with this player and it won't cause any audio degradation so next we have uh headphone extension cord and this core doesn't come with the pc20 uh but it is packed with the pa20 uh maybe haa thought that taller people would be behind this player not really sure why they include that um and here you have the USB cord this USB cord uh attaches into the player's audio jack the player the pa20 and the pc20 do not have USB uh Jacks built onto the players they both get connected via the audio jack you have your Chinese language uh manual uh we do include a English uh quick guide with the player uh but as you can see the manual St isn't very thick basically the player is very easy to use you'll probably know how to use the player within the first 5 minutes of using it uh your CD with software and drivers uh your warranty card but MP4 Nation does give you a 12 month standard warranty over this player and let's actually take a look at this bad boy uh it has a very nice form factor I've shown this play to a lot of people and we've all agreed it has a very nice PDA feel to it it's also very lightweight very well balanced has a nice black it's a plastic build and see over here you have the onof and hold button your 2.5 mm audio jack and here you have your micro SD slot you can add an additional 4 GB of external memory to this player uh this particular player I'm holding has 4GB internal memory and we also carry the 2GB internal memory version so let's turn this player on the player does take about 30 seconds to load see and as you'll see it has a very nice simple user interface and there you go very simple very easy very easily laid out here you have your video your music your picture your eBook reader your voice recorder and your FM radio down here is your setup and over here is very nice function this is where you go if you want to resume your video from where you were last watching it or your music or your ebook it's you can just go right here and go video continue audio continue or ebook continue so fantastic there's resume play functionality on this player check out music uh the video sorry it does have a built-in loudspeaker uh the video right now is a promo video for the Haka pa20 not sure what sheep have anything to do with this player you can adjust the volume through the touchscreen controls there you go and the way to fast forward this player is pretty cool to pause it you just press the middle of the screen resume fast forward resume again see very nice interface exit now check out the music the player can play Windows uh media audio uh WMA MP3 Flack uh and AP uh the player can play AVI and FLV video file formats as you can see everything is touchcreen uh fast forward pause increase decrease [Music] audio and this pretty cool you're video your audio options just pop up right here so you have a little mini menu and just close up there and the player can multitask also so now check out the [Music] picture there you have the images it's pretty cool too to go to the next you just press down there to go back you just press there and if you hold down in the middle you get options and you can do a slideshow or you can turn it left rotate it turn it 180\u00b0 so it's a hat hatch has put a lot of thought into this user interface and exit by holding middle go and it's very simple and easy to use as ebook and the player basically sorts out everything by pages so if you want you know just have to press up there to go to the next page next page getting very nicely done and see here's options you can save you can bookmark Pages you can jump Pages you can delete bookmarks it's uh again I said Haka spent a lot of time thinking this user interface out you have your standard voice recorder just go in there uh saves it in wave format and your FM radio and you can manually tune or or you can to have preset channels just go up there and you can save up to 10 different preset channels there we go and check out the setup you can change your language your how long the screen turns on your shut down the player this is where you have to go uh default setting your volume your fm settings let's see just press down there or you can just choose like that as I said this is a fantastic player as you can see the user interface is very simple and I've shown this to a lot of people there's all I'll talk about the iPod Touch uh this may not be as slick of a user interface but it's still very nice nobody's going to be laughing at you for having this uh and it plays a lot more video formats too there you go the Haka PA 20 and let's just turn this player out set down yep there you go [Music] uh if you want to see more about this

Anyway, in this video I'm going to show you how to make a \nvery easy jam felt cookie.\nOnce you understand the technique, you can make them in so many different shapes (heart, flower, etc)! If you have any questions, leave a comment below the video.\nIn the info box, you'll find the products list and\nthe useful links.\nI hope you enjoy the video! Good vision! Download the template from my web site (link in the description box).\nReport it on a 1 mm thick felt of your choice: I choosed beige and orange felt. I used the orange felt to create fullness and a 220 gr cardstock to create stifness. Combine all the elements and sew with 'punto festone',\nas shown in the video. Use a sewing thread of the same color of the felt. Choose anothe felt colour for the inside (for example brown or red). To make it a charm, use a ribbon. Sew the three elements together. Glue all the pieces together with hot glue. As I say, once you understand the technique, you can make them in so many different shapes (heart, flower, etc)! Free your imagination!

        "transcript": "hey everybody rocks the box a 90-year back match the gathering origin spoiled got some pretty sweet stuff today let's kick it off with Kathy onza regulars two and two white fur for three cret human with renowned 12 white tap target creature for over 43 of renown already solid human soldiers solid to tabler creature this is really strong because usually cards like this have mana tap this creature tap a creature the fact that you can do this as many times you want and use them to attack one makes it very easy to set off renown two works really well with other renowned cards and three basically gives you insane advantage on field now yes of course as requires that you have a lot of white mana so it's a car that you're going to want in a deck that's largely white even if it has another color either modern white or large majority of it white and one other color you don't want to expand to too many colors because if I restrictive the ability is still limited card is insane as constructed potential I don't think it's going to get there but it's possible as a top curve to like a white weenies kind of thing and of course in commander this currents going to be very powerful I think Jason sanctum this is actually spoiled by the mana source one of our own in the YouTube community which is super sweet you can check out his video he delves into the card far more than I do if you haven't already seen the video definitely check it out he's fantastic but I'll just my two cents it's really strong for enchantment instant sorceries are cheaper and give you scry not a car that's going to probably see much playing in a standardized environment would be interesting to test in modern just because there's so many storm storm variants in commander it's an absolute slam-dunk win awesome card and the arts pretty sweet to go chase then we have a cycle I'll actually just the cycle itself it's pretty solid I mean timber back wolf to virtue to that as long as you have additional version additional copies of it in play it gets one plus one is already two for two two bears fine being able to get additional power based on multiple copies at common is very good because you can even set this kind of card up with your own seal pool you don't even need to to do something with an injury undead servant 4432 zombie that went into the battlefield you get a 2 2 black zombie for each card named it in your graveyard realize this means if you have 0 of them in your graveyard it's 4432 which isn't great but if even if you have one of them in the graveyard if it's any kind of dis card mechanic in the set at all any credit cards that synergize discard this card could potentially be very very strong I think to provide wolf is a little better but still infectious blood loss is tootin chanted creature it gives 2 plus 1 haston attacks a return and when it dies you can search library card and infectious blood lesson put in your hand so realize that this allows you to scale auras and have multiple orders of tests show creature it also is an aura which is for its cost pretty powerful to +1 and haste did attack and return it available it's not such a problem for a grade x i think is well designed very solid common very miscreant as well 1411 flyer fine i generally don't love that kind of thing in limited but sure when enters the battlefield if you have another one named it you draw a card this is if you have three or four copies seems pretty good cleric of the forward order forward order it's a little tough to say two for two two solid already and when I smile if you do gain too light for each other copy of it you own also really solid honestly the most limited powerful I think our cleric of the for donor and timber back we'll just because in place scale and copies is really really good and you know themselves are really good the others are a little bit by themselves not as good for limited but as a cycle it's very very strong definitely going to be among the top tier comments from what I can from what we've been seeing so far i would think these would be top grabs for decks the last one is kind of blurred out i think it's topaz fireblade its 242 vigilance with renowned one and a common that's absolutely insane a 2-2 with upswing that also has renowned absolutely insane fantastic fantastic art now that's that's definitely top curve common that's definitely one of the best comments will likely see then we have the official art for Jace we've already talked about Jace but but yeah the art looks pretty awesome i'm sure in foil it's really gonna really going to shine big fan and then we have also just for the clash packs this is not involved with origins set itself but in the clash packs we have seeker of the way with new art looks fantastic great card from okla the eternal also new art little interesting of a perspectives it's kind of shadow doubt but sure and honored hierarch is actually I prefer this art but honored hierarch would be in the clash pack as well so this card which is likely likely to see some some former player or another means it be fairly simple to lay hands on copies and it probably will help with the price market as well i'm going to you guys think of today's spoilers down below in the comments section if you enjoy the video then tap the light but if you're new to the

        "transcript": "hello internet friends so today we are doing - Aurora Pattinson messy so hair it's gonna be very American crude a lot of bits from them just because I've sort of been experimenting that needs the best bits I can find that work together to get that sort of thing to my head firstly just watch the condition my hair as you know it's gonna go fluffy so I've had a few people ask me what sort of shampoo and conditioner I've been using it's these ones Helia these are both my Redken they are mint fused cool finish for men and a lot of shampoos and conditioners I've had in the past I've just got light source high street brand ones and I just stops using them I just sort of didn't wash my hair much I found that after watching my hair be really lightweight and everything but it's feel really dry and horrible but with these ones they don't if it was really nice and hydrated and everything I love this it's like me and in the shower you sort of wash your hair with the shampoo in and out really quick and then you put your conditioner on and leave it why do you add the shower duties just to get that extra bit of sort of hydration in there if he was really nice and cooling on your head you can feel it work you can feel like sort of doing some good things to your scalp because you can feel it on there it's nice and cool and I really like that that's all I'm not an expert on shampoo conditioner I'll be honest but that's the best one I've come across so far if I find any other ones I'll let you know again I can't remember the prices as of all this other stuff I remember anything and because I've always began always tell you want o put it on their finger okay and anyway sorry my head's just been washed a munition it's gonna go fluffy we're gonna dry it a little bit first and then we're going to get our first product in which is the American Crew like texture holes now basically this doesn't have much hold especially for my big bull she won't redo much but what it will do is get some texture it's more of sort of an a prep product so if your hair it's gonna be all horrible like this and you're gonna be a nightmare to work with put that in first it would also make it a bit more workable I mean if your hair doesn't need much hold and you could use this on its own but for me I'm gonna have to do some of that obviously I'm doing gonna do Robert Pattinson today we have fairly similar hairstyles and that we're both put quite big hair and of his off the face so like that and but that is about it I love would say off what a hair like him but to be honest I really haven't his hair is a lot lighter than mine and the short hair textures completely different mine is big and bushy and his his sort of lightweight and easier to work with he may go bald in the future because it hasn't got much hair I won't because I've got loads so I could take that consolation he may have millions and millions of girls adoring him and millions and millions of pounds but I've got loads of hair so in your face up hats I think when you see his hairstyle when he's estimate in it's one of the coolest stars out there and you know that's why I've been experiments because my hair doesn't do that sort of stuff very easily so I've got some bits here to do it and he'll have a lot of time you see him in like paparazzi shots and he looks like he doesn't wash and so there's not one of these ones this is one the ones very sort of does something with it and so let's let's start so now my hair is dry enough to put in the first product the light texture hold what we're gonna do put a little bit listen not much well it just made a little noise on on the camera you hear that human and so not much and put it in your hair what we're gonna do is just basically mess your hair up completely get it right in there loads of texture and then we're gonna dry up my eye so we you're not doing it so I'm doing it but I'm going to drive a hair a little bit more and when I dry it I'm gonna sort of do that with it so I guess more sort of texture in there okay so you may have seen as well I was drying my hair upwards because it's gonna be upwards if I dry it downwards it would then stay down obviously is a very American crude a as I mentioned the reason that is I've been experimenting and these products seem to work the best for me for this or style also American Crew is my favorite brand as well and just because I don't know why I just like it I like the way that they make my hair feel already conditioned my hair when I use them no I think it's because obviously I'm using a lot of professional products in it and they all sort of do good things to be hair and everything but I just find my use American Crew my hair feels like actually a little bit nicer after I washed it out and everything and actually just saw conditions your hair as you wear it and it does good things for your scalp and I just think it's a very good brand what I have here is the pomade I have viewed that one before it's a long time ago now but I'm gonna use that and I'm gonna use the forming cream now what we're gonna do is we're gonna use them together so this is called cocktailing and it's a really good idea especially if you have some problem hair for me particulars my hair is sort of a nightmare this is quite dry a lot of time and it's just big I need something that's gonna give it a bit of shine but often things that give a shine that have enough hold so I think cocktail if something's gonna give some hold to which is exactly what I'm doing here because Robinson's hair is so sort of shiny and healthy and stuff even to the point sometimes it looks a bit greasy when he doesn't wash so we need to pomade for that because it's really shiny and gives really nice or supple control but he's is also separating his bits all over the place whereas mine will go up but it'll go in a big clump so this is quite nice to keep it give us all that shine and nothing separated the next product is the forming cream now this has got some holes but it's also really pliable so if you need you know if you want to have a hole that you can sort touch all day like Rob Pattinson does and like I do a lot anyway then this is perfect so the both of my hands like that and he mix them both together and then you get some sort of awesome hybrid hair product like that and then you just go for it so obviously his hair is all over the shop so that's what what we're doing just get it in there start with right just in my hair and now we're gonna start styling it now something I've noticed what Rob Pattinson does is that he always has these hairs are pulled back at the sides in the back so that's what we're doing here this is something I do anyway with my hair but erm if you don't and you want hair like Robert Pattinson then do it but as well as having a baton so it has a bit of to a mess in there too so just sort of geek fingers in screw it up you know the rest really is pretty much do what you want and you know he has it's all over I mean my hair is not actually as long as his so won't do exactly the same thing be sort of just has bits all over all over the place the fringe is again everywhere so there's bit you know if you want to find bits and pull them you know do that because hair is all over the shop and it's actually probably one of the most on-trend looks at the minute just messy stuff you know get your head get in there I just oughta get your fingers in and you know mess it up okay so there you go just so bear in mind obviously my hair is a lot thicker than his and not quite as long so it's not really going to be exactly the same as this or my interpretation if you've got hair that is not as thick as mine it's maybe a little bit thinner then you probably have more luck than me I think he's quite lucky and that his head is quite easy to style because it looks like the consistency of a baby's hair those mines really coarse and horrible so yeah lucky bastards and they he's got everything the way we style our hair is quite similar although he's a lot nicer texture but one thing I noticed is that when I do my own hair I'll tend to still get the whole front out of the way and it'll all be worth fringe so basically where the fringe and the side start is about here for me for him it's a little bit more of a sort of more towards the middle here that's just something I noticed so rather than your parting there and that this one to that side usually it'd be all over that side and I quite like it though because I always wonder what to do with that bit sometimes it just all spikes up because it doesn't really know whether to go into one side and the other side in this goes vertical as usual and professional products you can't get them from high street stores you need to go to a salon or a website thank you all so much for watching really appreciate all the views I get if you feel like subscribing to me and you're

        "transcript": "hey everyone just wanted to do an update video I made a previous video on how to make some cheap steel targets and since then I've kind of upgraded how I've done it mainly because the way I was connecting the Shepherd's hook to the steel plate with the rope was allowing too much playback from the left to the right throwing those you know the the bullet itself possibly in the left or right direction which if you're in the woods or something isn't a huge deal but when you're at a gun range you obviously just want the bullets to go down as much as possible so what I did is I went to the same place I bought these steel targets just a local salvage yard metal repository type place and padam open the hole up just a little bit bigger for me so I was able to get the Shepherd's hook through the hole itself and hang the the plate on the Shepherd's hook directly without having any kind of roll between the two and as you can see that definitely helps with the the play back and forth to the left you don't have as much of that with the roll you can't spin it around it just really goes back and forth like that especially with the bigger one when you have a wider steel plate it definitely will have a lot less play to the the left and right just really swinging back and forth which is ultimately what you want so that round is deflected downward so altogether you know with the Shepherd's hook which was about $15 the steel plates depending on the size those were about $15 a piece you know the paint and everything involved you know I really just have about twenty to twenty-five dollars thirty dollars max each on each of these steel plate targets so as I mentioned before it's you know I enjoy shooting the steel targets much more than than just paper you get that cool steel sound and you you know if it's a freshly painted steel target you can definitely still see where you're hitting as you can see here so definitely a good cheap way of doing it if you guys need some steel targets to make or can't afford the ones that are online this is a good alternative hope this helps you guys out if you have any questions feel free to let me know guys thanks you"

        "transcript": "number one tatashi Fuji Makia stated that his motivation to create the series Kuro basket was because when he was in Middle School he used to create sketches of Dragon Ball and slum dunk manga and he would sell these sketches for money to his friends eventually he entered a competition and won a prize of 50,000 yen in his teen years he then realize he may have a talent as a child one of his Hobbies was to purchase shown in Jump and talk about it with his classmates on a weekly basis tadatoshi only became a manga artist after dropping out of University and was wondering whether or not he left it too late and to put it in his words he almost pissed his pants as he didn't get serialized or win any competitions at the time he initially wanted to and still had the desire to create a golf Sports manga however whilst entering a competition with a submission which was inspired by Dragon Ball Z he received a notion from his Editor to make a Sports manga thus Kon no basket was created number two we all know the concept in Kono basket is kind of unique in terms of an anime where side type character is the main protagonist the reason fujimaki did this is because he wanted to draw something which is focused on a side character and created a story in Direction which displays that people work hard in the shadows because usually in anime's protagonist show the feeling of even if you leave me on my own then we will still win if you even if you don't support me the main concept of kuruko who is the main character which feels like a side character was for him to use tap passes while making movements exaggerated fujimaki also said by being a side character means having a low presence so this training of thought formed his idea in his head to create caco he also created the skills called misdirection for the character but finds it confusing himself in matches and complicated in Fury number three fujimak has stated the main influence for kuruku is the manga slam dunk and also because he joined the basketball Club when he was in Middle School he stated that he eventually dropped out of the club halfway and doesn't consider himself to be good at basketball at all but kuruno basket would not exist if he did not join the basketball club during his school years because he would not have experienced things like being shouted at during practice which is now reflected in the series number four the creator of the series admits that he has set a rule for himself which is to not ignore the law of physics for example I mean throwing the ball from behind the backboard is a perfect example Fuji Mari has said that there's a one out of 100 chance for the ball to go in in real life however he only used that fact for all mean to emphasize his presence and skill however when talking about midorima super long distance shot guim Maki admits that given the stance it would not even be possible in real life when kuk noas was confirmed for second year of serialization fujimaki visited America to collect information about the NBA he had also gone to schools to research basketball clubs to help his adaptation of the series and characters as well as settings he also stated his favorite NBA team is Los Angeles Clippers and his all-time favorite player is Chris Paul number six in kuruk each significant players is given amazing basketball techniques such as the vice claw entering the zone and overflow fujimaki has stated that he has also tried to think of new ways for protagonists to win the series he explains during midor R's match where he throws the ball from under the basket to score a full court three-point shot which in American NBA for example is a competition to win a million dollars in the end he presented this to his editor and was told that this is too much this is too farfetched fujimaki admitted that he had no idea of how he was going to come up of an idea of how midama would be defeated because he already made him so overpowered and he eventually had to think it over during eating at restaurants and eventually all we all know he gets defeated number seven kagami wears Michael Jordan signature shoe the Nike Air Jordan Ones he previously wore the same brand in black and red color scheme but he broke that pair and received a new one for aine this one is has the original Air Jordan scheme which is white red and black and obviously is stated in the show that his shoe size 29.5 CM number eight in the original conception of carami he was still tall and muscular but his hairstyle was completely different instead of red and dark red it was black with wide stripe of blonde in the middle his hair was also short and spiky and his name was completely different which was suaro iki number nine Mida is Fuji maki's favorite character to draw but always finds him to be a bit weird because of his lucky items wise kuruko is the hardest character for him to draw he has also stated that the love interest with kuruku and Satsuki mu mui and mu with o me because they are childhood friends is an interesting topic he would like to explore but thinks in a Sports Anime it will be quite difficult as well as the reason there are only two female characters in the show is because in his words unfortunately that's the nature of basketball there are not too many women number 10 the goal of the series has already been set and this is for the generation of Miracles to reunite and eventually compete in bigger tournaments but the possibility and journey towards that would not be as predictable as everyone thinks according to Tadashi fujimaki the creator of this series Tadashi fujimaki believes that he would do everything he can to live up to the reader's expectations but he want want something to be lost or to make it intense for serin to win or whatever to go on he just wants it to make be amazing anyways guys there was way more facts and information about kurir boset so I may do another video about it however these are 10 of the longer informative facts which I think will Intrigue you most cuz it blew my mind and anyway thanks for watching and please subscribe like and share because this took long to make as see see you guys next time [Music] please"

        "transcript": "hey guys in today's video I want to talk about a lip product that I've fallen in love with and it is the e.l.f lip stain pen the one I'm using today is called Berry blush um lip stains come from all kinds of different brands and this is just one that I'm showing in this video and I get guess that they work in a pretty similar way so for those of you who've never tried a lip stain before um staining means that you only get like a little bit of color like a a flush of color um and not like a harsh line as you would from my lipstick or lip pen um so a lip stain is a perfect way to get just a little bit more color but in a more subtle way and the way that I'm going to use it is by enhancing my upper lip as you guys know if you have eyes then my upper lip is pretty thin and it is thinner than my lower lip and I don't really wear that much um color on my lips I like focusing on the eyes so it's not really that big of an issue for me but if I do want to wear like really luscious red lips or anything like that it tends to look a little well it doesn't look perfect because my lips are kind of thin so it it does look better on a full set of lips but I'm going to show you how to cheat today using the lip stain pen um it looks like this color is really dark um it's called Berry blush but it really isn't this is pretty much as close to my natural lip color as I could come I know it sounds weird because it really looks like a really dark color but that's actually the choice um I do have some foundation on my lips right now so they're not really this you know um pale I do have some color on them but um this is a really good color for me so what you're aiming for is a color that matches the color of your lip so what I'm going to do is try to plump my upper lip a little bit so I'm going to maybe zoom in so just going a little bit above my Cupid's bow right here if you exaggerate this too much it is going to show then just taking it down and again I am going a little bit outside of my natural line to make the lip look appear thinner I mean Fuller Jesus and then I'm just going to fill out the entire upper lip making sure that they're even and then doing the lower lip as well but for that one I'm not going outside the lines so as you can see it's not much color it's just a light stain but it does help my upper lip appear as more plump more full and it is this is a great look on its own I don't really have to do anything right now but it's a great base for adding more color or what I'm going to do it is add a lip gloss of course you can do this with a regular lip liner but the point of using the lip stain is that it gives a more subtle impression it doesn't appear my lips don't appear as super plumped they just have a little bit more fullness in them I'm using the LA Colors moisturizing glossy lips sheer lip gloss uh today in color tropical punch just to get a little bit of Pizzaz on my lips and then I'm sort of following the lip stain line just to make sure that it gets all the way out there and that's it so yeah I really do recommend using lip stain um it works for me it's really good for when you have thin lips and want to just pump them up a little bit and um if you guys have tried other brands or other colors and you want to share then go ahead and do that in the commentary I always love that um but I do like like e.l.f uh I'm probably going to be talking more about e.l. products coming up I do like the the whole um cruelty-free thing and uh they have a great selection and they're really cheap so great brand if you haven't checked them out then go ahead and do that e.l. stands for eyes lips face um great brand so yeah hope you like my Friday look that's all for this video thank you guys for watching and I'll see you next time bye"

        "transcript": "hi my name is Jamie and I'm the design lead for the Creator expert series today we've got a real special treat for train fans if you have the Emerald night or the mayor's train which maybe is a little bit old-fashioned or a little bit industrial we're going full speed ahead into the future with our first high-speed passenger train called the horizon Express and this is the January exclusive or what we call now the Creator expert model and we're very excited about it because traditionally we've kind of avoided the high-speed angle because that's usually where city goes and that tends to go towards a younger crowd so the building experience is a little bit more simple and a little more basic but with this train we can assure you that there are lots of clever and fun building techniques and you're going to have a real treat building it so basically I'm just going to go through some of these parts because we're very excited to show you them if we start with the main engine I think there's some really fun building techniques in here and that's surprising because these trains are traditionally very aerodynamic which could mean that they're a bit simple but we found some wonderful opportunities to surprise you with some building techniques the first of issue which you would probably see is on the frontier and we had to do some upside down building to try to keep this nice smooth shape and you'll see that it continues up into this windshield and that's actually a printed windshield which is the first time we've printed on that element which we're pretty excited about we also have printing on this tile here which is quite nice and then we wanted to go a little bit beyond printing and we wanted to try to avoid labels wherever possible so this back area here is a really fun section because the chevron or these arrows are all brick built so there are tiny little pieces little slopes that actually make up each part of that which we think you really have fun exploring and building then of course we have the functionality with the pantographs they can go up and down and they both work so depending on the direction of travel you can decide which way to go and then of course the trained opens up and when you look inside we have a removable electric motor which is like on the real train except I don't think on the real train it says easily removable but you can take that out actually and add power functions because just by inserting a battery box in a receiver and a motor you can power this and then on the front we also have a conductor or a driver which is a female driver which has been long overdue since we've done that and we thought it would be a great opportunity to include her in this set so lots of fun things to explore when you're building the engine so if we continue down the Train we pull the wagons out here and one of the first things that you'll notice is that the trains are actually joined they have a co joined wheelset there bogie we actually don't get to do this very often in fact I think we've only done it once before but it really gives a nice sleek look to the train that we think is rather exciting in addition to that we have working doors and you can see the doors actually function on both sides and these are brick-built doors which we think adds a really nice detail and look and then of course you want to play with the train so we want to make it show that way the roofs come off when the roof comes off here you can see is actually a really nice split it divides it at a midpoint and you can see most of this actually comes off on the roof and what that does is it allows you a lot more access to get in on the play and play with the minifigures and as you look inside on the minifigures one thing that might stand out is actually we have one of the passengers has already decided to use the restroom I guess you couldn't wait until the train left the station but we do have a restroom here which is rather neat with a sliding door and then we have two passengers we have some newspapers we have some luggage and some wonderful details really to help help you along your journey then if I move to the second car you can take the roof off again and you can see that we have a nice club car or a dining car depending on how you'd like to go you can see we have a couple here perhaps on a date or whatever story you'd like to imagine we have the coffee machine we have a chess set with drawers that can open an extra table in case they want to come from first class between the wagons and then you can also see the attendant here ready to mix up the drinks one of the cool features of this part and actually both of these wagons are these windows these windows you may recognize because they normally go vertical and we've chosen to lay them on their side and that gives the train a really sleek fast look and also a different building experience for you guys to enjoy so just to recap some of those really cool elements that we have in this set we have of course the train window which you would expect in a normal we've just taken it to another level bringing it sideways but of course train fans will hopefully like that we have some nice printed elements here and in addition to that we have this great angle plate and when you start building with it you're really going to appreciate the possibilities of what you can accomplish and we try to add quite a few of those in the set in addition to that we have a new tile and this tile is an inverted tile so it gives you a nice smooth surface on the underside that I know a lot of your fans that don't like the studs to show on your models that will really help polish them off and make them look nice and then of course we have on the frontier a nice angle element to keep the train going nice and fast in addition to that we have the figures again just to bring out the cast it's almost like the credits on a movie we have all of them we have a nice female driver we have the the conductor we have a couple of first-class passengers and in the couple on a romantic right across the countryside and speaking of that country side just to give you an idea of the expandability of this model it is a train and as a train we would really like to encourage you to explore how much bigger can get and if you take this train and you add a second one you really can start to see how impressive this can become and that actually helps explain about why we have some of these numbers on here because there's additional numbers and you can expand your train as long as you want so we really hope you get a chance to enjoy the horizon Express"

        "transcript": "so first off pacific tomb [\u00a0__\u00a0] you you ruined a perfectly adequate albeit boring and somewhat unoriginal intro i'll give you that much but still [\u00a0__\u00a0] you for those of you guys watching pacific two has since been kicked from the s d i'm totally kidding he's not been kicked i wouldn't do that what's up guys and i almost did the intro tomb you're in my [\u00a0__\u00a0] head what am i doing my name is tyler and god there i am again but this is a 14 god damn it tyler what is wrong with you 14-0 with the mp5 and i gotta say this gun sucks there's really nothing special about this gun you have the ump which has pretty good recoil and a great rate of fire you have the pp90 which has a great hip fire and rate of fire you have the p90 which has a pretty average rate of fire but an amazing size clip and you have the uh mp7 which also has a great size clip and basically no recoil and so that's what's special about those guns but this one the mp5 there is nothing that that is that stands out from this gun apart from the others same with the pm9 i mean i guess the hip fire is pretty good on that or maybe that's the only thing you can do with it i don't know i haven't really used the mp9 that much i mean pm9 i get those two mixed up a lot but doesn't matter anyways what i'm gonna be talking about in this commentary is the s delete and where we're hoping to go with this channel because i'm not sure if any of you guys or most of you guys just think this is the channel where we're just collaborating on and dumping random videos on when we feel like it no um at this moment it may seem like that because it's somewhat accurate but myself and tyler or deathly i am we just call him deathly because there can't be two tylers and i'm not gonna call him tai cause that's kind of weird but um we're hoping this channel will become the main hub for search and destroy once black ops 2 comes out we're going to be putting a lot of effort into that and i can't believe i forgot there's a trophy system there [\u00a0__\u00a0] trophy systems people just camp with those i don't ever see in search when there's a trophy system it's because someone's a [\u00a0__\u00a0] and they don't want to get naded or something like that but anyways we are going to be putting a lot of effort into into this channel once black ops 2 comes out daily or buy daily content is it buy or semi no it's by daily content at least because we're hoping this channel will blow up and become the main hub for search destroy when someone on youtube just search for search and strike we're hoping our channel this channel the smd elite will be in the top result that's our hope and that's what we're going to aim for and we're hoping it can be a community-wide kind of a term you know like codops 24 7 or team noble everyone knows who that is everyone knows those channels we're hoping that our channel can also become that on somewhat of the same level but related to search destroy we're really hoping for that and uh you know what i think we can do it if we put enough effort in and we put enough decent tips and tricks and enough great content and strong commentaries and stuff like that which i know we're already doing we just need to do it a little bit more because we took kind of a break this week i think this is the first this is probably the longest break we've taken since we started which was about five days tomb uploaded a video yesterday and nearly got kicked out for i'm just totally joking again he went nowhere near getting kicked and i wasn't even mad but uh he's right too i gotta stop doing that i gotta find a different intro anyways i just know there's been a lot going on over the past week and a half or so from all of us here at the smg elites i know kyle and rich they both moved out and they're living on their own now somewhat and nick started school again so he's been busy with class a lot uh tyler or [\u00a0__\u00a0] you deathly deathly uh between school and his job and his girlfriend it's just it's hard to find time for this which i completely understand um what else fidelis is not even at home right now he's doing something about a job down somewhere else away from his house where's brother libs or something and aaron or ninja robot i'm amazing okay [\u00a0__\u00a0] just change your name uh he uh moved recently he moved last week and he's just getting settled in and stuff myself actually tomb tomb has actually been kind of active and deathbringer is always active but myself i've actually taken this semester of college off from switching my course from mechanical to sorry from chemical to mechanical engineering which i'm hopefully gonna be starting up again in january but anyways that r i really am no excuse at all but this is just how i am i just felt like i should upload a video here because it's we're gonna go with that one for another week if i don't no we're not we probably wouldn't but that about wraps up the video the final score is 14-0 if you enjoyed leave a like and i just wanted to make this video to kind of clear up confusion as to whether or not we have any sort of ambition or goals for this channel and i'm gonna say we absolutely do and we're absolutely ready to make this channel a name we're absolutely ready to make this channel known in the community as the main central hub for search and story content the best on youtube we're prepared and we're ready and stick with us and we'll do it but anyways guys that's it for me if you want to check out my channel you don't know who i am but you all should know who i am anyways tyler or dysfunction and my link will be in the description below peace"

        "transcript": "first there was the rain stick remember that one then the slit drum lots of musical instruments and i got a new one this time this is the finger piano and wyatt has actually tuned it up and he's going to play what are you going to play teen spirit that smells like teen spirit nirvana on the thumb piano go ahead and that's the first time you've ever heard nirvana on a thumb piano anyway so this is the project it is a thumb piano really this is a instrument it has its origins in africa and it will make a nice addition alongside of my slit drum and my rain stick i have planed down a couple of pieces of red cedar to a little bit over a quarter of an inch thick as with all musical instruments it's really better if you could use a hard wood you'll probably get a better tone out of it but i really like the red cedar it smells really nice and it was free it was given to me so once again i don't have to buy wood i've taken a couple of pieces of that cedar and i've sandwiched them together and stuck them together with some carpet tape and i've drawn out a grid here i want to have this bottom section six inches wide and then i'm coming up to three quarter inches in on the top so it's going to be angled a little bit and i think that feels about right now i've got both of those cut to that wedge shape and i can peel them apart and i've cut some strips that i'll need to cut down to size but they'll you know go on like that the top will fit on now where this strip sits on this panel there's an angle that needs to be cut there let me show you how i'm going to handle cutting this angle i'm going to use my miter saw and set this piece in to where you can see the angle is going that way then what i'll do is i'll just bring my blade down i'm going to lock it in and i'm just going to move it over to that angle right there now [Applause] i'll be able to take my strip in and i can cut it at the proper angle there are all four pieces the side pieces cut and you can see those angles there in other words why the bottom goes this way so this angle has to be that way on this board and this board well all of the boards and um yeah it would probably be nice to actually just cut miters here so that you know i wouldn't have end grain showing but well i just suck at making my ears so yeah i'm gonna have a little bit of end grain showing and now i need to make the sound hole and i've got a forstner bit here i really don't know how big it is it's that big and i think it should go i don't know right about here now i've got my hole cut and i cut a couple of quarter inch dowels and one is a little bit longer than the other one i've glued that one down and i've put a little glue on this one and i'm just going to place it just kind of eyeball it you know right around in here now i'm just drilling a couple of holes into a thicker dowel so here's my box with these two smaller dowels glued on i've glued up the bottom part haven't glued this on yet so it's going to go like that now i've got my dowel cut with the holes in it [Applause] you know these screws will fit in like that well coming through the other side so now i just need to drill holes right here and here so i've got the screws going through the back coming up through the larger dowel with wingnuts on them and that way i can tune these arms now i experimented with a number of different materials for these arms and i had some brass pieces and some steel pieces and none of them were working very well because they well they would just simply bend but what i have discovered is to use coping saw blades because it's spring steel and it well it springs back and it it won't bend and stay into that shape and that way you know i can change the tone of you know any of these by lengthening them tightening it back down getting a different tone so what i'm doing now is taking these coping saw blades you know and snipping off this little pin here that holds it into this saw and then i'll just cut these in half and there it is all glued up i've uh just with sandpaper rounded over all of the edges makes it feel a little bit nicer i couldn't use my round over bit on my router because i had already stuck these on there but it works out fine that way now i need to do is put some lacquer on it and put the tone arms in boy do i like the way that lacquer really brings out the grain in that red cedar it looks really nice so i'm ready to assemble this thing now you know getting these screws in here and to come up through there is a little bit of a trick well now comes the fun part i've got all these blades cut at different lengths and what i want to do is i want to have the lower tones in the middle and go up to the higher tones i have eight of them on here i'd like to have a full scale if i could but this will just take a lot of trial and error and fooling around with it i'm sure you probably can't hear that very well on my camera but it actually makes a pretty decent sound and i never did tune these probably the way they should be uh maybe i'll fool around with that a little bit longer one thing that i have learned is to make sure that this is tightened down really well and that will help them resonate a lot better well there you have it there is the thumb piano not really sure if it's music or not at least the way i'm playing but it's a great fun little project you can easily make it an afternoon using just scrap lumber and i'm sure you can improve upon this there's probably a lot of different ways you could build this thing you know maybe set the hole down a little further you'd probably get a different tone might make it a little bigger use different sized uh metal strips here but i'll spend some time tuning this and kind of tweaking it a bit uh thanks again for watching get started on those christmas presents if you haven't already uh and visit me my website at woodworking4meremortals.com i'll talk to you guys next time you"

        "transcript": "hey guys torid Dori here and look what we have today nightmare Foxy the pirate I've been waiting for an image of Foxy to be revealed on Scott coron's website all week and I was starting to get worried that he wasn't going to release one at all so to finally see this in all its creepy gloriousness is just awesome so taking a closer look at Foxy what do we see he still has most of his signature features the hook in place of a hand pointy sharp teeth and part of his suit damaged him missing nothing too special there but what's with the weird bendy metal tongue well given the fact foxy was already the most fearsome looking out of the four animatronics what with the hook the nashes and the damage to his body Scott had to come up with that little bit extra to make Foxy Stand Out amongst the other nightmares and I think he did a good job in doing so this also ties in well with the nightmare element the game seems to be based on speaking of which if we take Foxy's image and brighten it up do we see the same way we did in the previous three images well it's difficult to say the letters here are so faint that it's hard to make out what's written at all now I assumed this would say nightmare as it did in the previous images but the word is too long and the last letter looks more like an R rather than an e also if we zoom in on Foxy's teeth and darken the image ATT had the word nightmare can be found here instead but then what does the longer word say unless I'm completely off the last few letters look like r d e and another r at first the only word ending like that I could think of was murder but that doesn't account for the rest of the letters then it suddenly hit hit me what if it's not a long word but a phrase do you guys happen to remember what was written on the sign outside a Pirate Cove sorry out of order whether this has any significance to the game or is just something Scot through in to keep us busy I don't know but the fact the other animatronics didn't have anything like this hidden away in the images leaves me pondering the last thing I wanted to show you is to do with Foxy's eyes if we Zoom right in and darken the image a lot something becomes visible only in his right eye the numbers eight and seven once again another reference to The Bite of 87 now if we put all these elements together is Scott actually telling us who caused the bite think about it the word nightmare was hidden not only in the detail of the image but right in Foxy's teeth and what do teeth do they bite things we know the phrase out of order was written on the sign outside of pirates's Cove and people have already speculated in the past that the reason for this was because foxy caused the bite and of course the last clue being the numbers in Foxy's eye as far as I know none of the other images have those num hidden anywhere this tells me that foxy himself has a significant part in the event other than that we can see the same elements of the pictures we did in the previous three we have the date for the release Halloween of this year as well as the phrase or me like I said in my previous video on the rumors circulating Five Nights at Freddy's 4 I'm assuming this question refers to the bite of 87 however for all I know Scott has deliberately placed these Clues to throw us off the SC and there could be something even more Sinister going on we just have to wait and see anyway that's enough the ring from me I'd love to hear your thoughts on what I found and if you have any ideas of your own don't hesitate to comment and share thank you for watching guys and I hope you have a good day bye-bye"

        "transcript": "One might assume that deeply personal and\ncaptivating single-player experiences are dying out. It\u2019s easy to think this way when we live\nin a world saturated with first-person games about shooting where campaigns continue to\ngrow shorter and have superficial multiplayer tacked-on as a crutch in an attempt to elongate\nor cling to relevance. Well, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is here\nto take a stand and let the gaming world know that amazing single-player experiences are\nstill here and very-much alive. This stand begins surprisingly with a lot\nremaining the same since the gates of Oblivion were closed. Much like its predecessors, you can still\nlook through every nook and cranny, you still have a gigantic world to explore, horses are\nstill all-terrain vehicles and you still kill enemies and strip them down to their unmentionables. But for how much that has remained, even more\nhas changed; most notably with character creation and customization. As in Oblivion, there are still the traditional\nElder Scrolls races of Argonian, Nord, Dark Elf, and so on. The difference being that during character\ncreation you no longer choose from primary and secondary skill, attributes or a birth\nsign. Now, that might sound like it\u2019s missing\nall the character customization and RPG elements you care about; but it\u2019s not. Those elements are still in the game, they\u2019ve\njust been changed a bit. Like birth signs for example, are placed around\nthe open-world on stone obelisks; one can be activated at a time for specific beneficial\neffects, or some birth signs from previous Elder Scrolls can simply be found in the skill\ntrees as a perk. Perks points are distributed to benefit specific\ndisciplines; like improving weapon damage or lowering the cost to cast spells. Perks have also made previously broken or\nintangible gameplay styles either much more fun or impressively realized. Like the ability to take a breath to slowdown\ntime and zoom-in with a bow  or huge damage multiplyers for daggers; making\nthe previously mundane weapon-type extremely lethal. To acquire perk points you have to level up. As is accustomed in the Elder Scrolls franchise,\nlevel increases come with practicing and honing abilities through their usage, not with experience\npoints. So, if you want to be a great blacksmith,\nthen go hit the forges. You wanna have crazy lightning spells, then\nget all Darth Sidious on some faces. Just as in real life you get better at stuff\nthe more you do it. Now more than ever, with the use of the vastly\nimproved dual-wielding system, you can hone multiple skills simultaneously. The system allows a weapon to be clenched\nin each fist or a healing spell in one hand while frost flies from the other. The play-styles and character customization\nare very malleable which really pronounces the attitude The Elder Scrolls series has\nalways tried to express, which is the idea of open-endedness. The ideals of being an open-ended experience\ndon\u2019t stop at character customization and combat, your gaming freedoms are also ingrained\nin the very way you go about taking your created character through the land of Skyrim to reveal\nthe legend of the Dragonborn. The legend, of which, is tied directly into\nthat combat and adventuring. In Skyrim, you are the Dragonborn; the mortal\nwith the blood of dragons who is able to kill the great winged serpents and absorb their\nsouls to perform powerful shouts. These shouts do more than just tie into the\nstory however. As they\u2019re obtained, shouts allow a range\nof new abilities like spanning gaps previously inaccessible or tearing dragons down from\nthe sky. With the way shouts become part of the adventure\nin addition to gameplay, this is easily Bethesda\u2019s best main storyline to date; making the narrative\nfeel fully realized and less of an afterthought. Really, all the content in general is superior\nto previous entries; I could seriously write a review for every major story arch in the\ngame. Like, the Thieves\u2019 Guild, the Dark Brotherhood,\nthe Mage\u2019s College, the many different Demi-God quests with the Daedric Princes, the school\nfor the Bards or the Civil War brewing over religious suppression; Skyrim is simply a\nlively nation filled with substance and a countless amount of fruitful endeavors to\nbecome part of in a beautiful land to do it. Throughout Skyrim\u2019s entirety, developer\nBethesda has really found a harmony of design choices that all coalesce into a single, united\nidentity of gameplay, art and execution. From the way the main story is filled with\nmetaphor of how powerful speech and language can be which is then tied into the gameplay\nthrough shouts as the dragonborn shapes the nation of Skyrim with a powerful voice, to\nthe beautifully foreign structures of a Gothic and Viking stylization that populate the landscapes,\nto the very way the music meshes with harmonious harp strings that are complimented by a primal\nViking choir; every aspect of Skyrim brings all its ideas and intentions together to create\nan individual experience that becomes the player\u2019s unique world. Simply put: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is\none of the greatest single-player role-playing games ever created. You shouldn\u2019t miss it."

        "transcript": "hey guys today I thought I'd share with you something special I've seen a few videos spent a while back now on a couple of people restoring their vintage Millennium Falcon I really didn't think too much about it until I actually did my collection video or my display collection video and while I was looking at my Falcon hanging from the ceiling I thought you know that looks bad it's it really did look terrible you guys might know numbness but then one of my first videos I did years ago found this and my mother's attic actually when we was up there looking for something else I think it might have been Christmas decorations or something to help her out and decorate and run across this sitting in between the rafters and if you guys know anything about attics putting something in there like this with all these little creases and divots in it it's just sitting there over 20 plus years it's gonna get dusty and discolored and hid what really didn't look bad so I cut it down from my basement where I had it hanging and took it apart you know it's no trouble to take apart it's just a few screws and just be sure to take all your loose things if you decide to do this and put them in a ziplock bag that way you won't lose them and surprisingly left to me soap and water you know in a toothbrush not long at all hit it really did it changed colors it it really did surprise me I didn't do the video through the whole restoration part of it here you can take a look at what it looked like before and here's the after it's a to me I'm just absolutely blown away with the end result and one of the biggest concerns with the me before I even started doing this was the decals you guys know the money in Falcon had a lot of decals on it so after talking back and forth to one of my YouTube friends on here counts take us if you guys know for me what counts thank us please be sure to check him out of the super nice guy and has a phenomenal collection he really did helped me out into as far as my restoration went because he's the one that sent me the document file for the big house for the for the vintage Millennium Falcon printed them out on sticker paper I think's for to call what it's called and here you have it the don't think about it mine didn't have mine I don't think he did had all the decals on I still have my little paper working it shows you where to where to put the love decals on the on the top part but I don't think it I had a home I don't like to begin with apparently may have lost interest in you you know we need a kid putting stickers on stuff you just want to play with you don't put stickers on but the end result was really good here's a here's an example this is one of the back for the engines and here's one that's you know it's really in bad shape here's how here was the end result I think it came out quite nice here's another example as far as this one right here goes you know they were just a little bit different color I guess that I could have messed around with the editing part on my document to change the color and get it back to where it looked like this but you know I'm happy really happy with the way that with the way that it came out and I know a lot of people that's worked on their old or this particular ship in general is they've just gave up on on this part of it I'm here to tell you right now that's what took the longest I fiddled around with that little motor for the longest time and I'm here to tell you it was it was a pain in ass but I've got mine to working it was a kind of a quick design that Kenner came up with for this part to actually work for the little motor that slips on the piece of plastic to make some noise but it's kind of a bad design if you actually sit down and look at it and like I said mine was painting ass I actually had to take the little motor apart because I figured out that mine weren't working because the receptors had came loose from the inside of the motor and they really didn't video that but here you can take a look at you know the inside what the motor actually looks like now after I got the motor to working and I had to you know the Falcon apart I thought that I would give it an upgrade and what I mean by an upgrade as a kid I always wanted lights on mine you know not a whole lot but you know just a couple of lights so I found a couple of super bright miniature LEDs and install them it's a not a very hard process to do this and but here you can take a look at how rendering for mine okay once I got to the back as far as just how I wanted to have mine hooked up for the lights I decided to just leave them hooked with the with a 9-volt battery no switch you know no anything is just it's just you hooking a 9-volt up to the to the other end of it and sliding the battery back down and you know that's it and there's how mine there's how it keep mine old now here's the end result here's what it's what it looks like and you know I'm doing this during the day but man these lights are super bright so happy with the with the end result the way this came out always always wanted lights on mine when I was a kid like I said if you guys are I have a vintage money and Falcon and you're not happy with the way it looks just take it apart and clean it you know when you're putting it back together you just got to remember that this hittin the mechanical thing with moving parts so there's no need to really over tighten the screws just you know just snug them up and you should be fine really really happy with the end result of mine and the head of the lights on it he just makes it really makes the vintage mine Falcon really stand now couldn't be happier so you guys tell me what you think like I said again thanks again counts thanks for your help with the with the decals and guys I really do appreciate everybody watching if you've got any comments or questions just post them and I'll answer them the best that I can and that's all I had today for my collection"

This is a look at what you'll see.\u00a0\u00a0 First, you sign up online for $10 per person bringing your hiking\u00a0gear and water to drink. There is parking near the gorge, off the North Dam access road, across from New Life Children's Center. Then you board a van that takes you to the\u00a0top of the dam  where we begin the tour.\u00a0\u00a0 First, there is an introduction,  then the\u00a0actual hike led by knowledgeable guides. Guide: \"Over a long period of time, water eats away\u00a0limestone. So when it rains, the rocks have cracks on them naturally. The water runs\u00a0down in the cracks and it lays in those cracks. It gets what you call dissolution\u00a0of limestone. Wherever there's an opening or a hole, it gets bigger and bigger over time where there's water running.\".

Overall, I really like the drum I think they did a really good job It comes Untuned and then you have to tune it yourself that takes some time, if you don't have experience don't panic, it happen to all of us It's just a matter of pulling the diamonds properly and take your time use your body's strength and is going to be fine Overall is a really nice drum, I really like it I had a lot of fun playing it I carried it around for different gigs and drum circles and I have to say that I was impressed I was impress because of its size and because of its volume So, I invite you to check it yourself and let us know what you think Also, if you want to have another instrument reviewed at our site if you think you want to see how an instrument plays or behaves let us know, drop us a line and we'll try to find it for you and post it on one of our videos My name is Diego, signing off for Loudest reviews  This was the Meinl Djembe, African djembe and hope to see you in any other of our next videos take care byebye."

        "transcript": "hi this is yolanda vanveen and in this segment we're gonna talk about how to care for a topiary or how to care for topiaries now a topiary is pretty much any type of plant that has grown to be a nice visual design that's going to be unnatural than its natural growth habit so a topiary can be pretty much any plant that has grown into another shape to look like an animal or a flower or even a heart topiary started back in the Roman days and it's much related to bonsai that was started in China in Japan but a topiary was more like a large boxwood that was in a nice garden that they would trim into the shape of a horse or trim it into the shape of an eagle or anything really interesting and so over the years in the centuries we've continued to take topiaries into different shapes and right now a big trend is just taking ivy and training it to look like another shape and right here I'm trying to make a big heart out of this ivy Ivy topiary and so as long as it keeps growing and gets more medusa-like stems I just put it back into the container so that it stays more compact and eventually I want this to just be a big bubble and to be a nice heart that's just all Ivy and so to take care of it you've got to make sure and keep it moist just like any other plant but you don't want it sitting in water because it will rot as well and many times topiaries are made right into moss and so you want to keep that moss really wet but never too dry either or too wet and they want full Sun most topiaries are made out of box woods or Ivy's or even Holly and they all need full hot Sun and they will do really well and then the best time to trim them is in the winter time and then they'll get new growth in the spring and the summer and as long as you continually trim out the wild medusa-like stems or put them back in closer and compact or wrap it back into the topiary they'll do really well and you will find that you can have a topiary last many many years and be an instant hit at your garden party"

        "transcript": "Hello ! i am Guido from Football Tricks Online and today i will teach you the following trick we had this trick on our channel already... but it was explained with text only today i will do a spoken tutorial so you understand better mostly because we will do harder tricks in the future and we need to know how to perform this trick before that... in freestyle you got to start by the really basics and then combine them to achieve harder tricks if you wanna start with the hard with out knowing the basics... that wont work before we start... you got to know how to juggle the ball perfectly  as done in Freestyle if you know how to juggle but you dont got that perfect control... as freestylers... click on the video on screen and learn how to juggle as a perfect Freestyler there you will learn some special techniques for perfect juggling So... click on the video or link will also be in description To start you need to dominate the Outside Around The World trick You can learn this by clicking the video on screen there will also be a link in the description once you learned the Outside Around The world, we can move on You will also need to learn the following trick on screen click on the video to watch the tutorial and link to the video will aslo be in description Once you dominate this trick as well... we can move on Dont try to learn todays trick in a rush... learn those 2 tricks we talked about then try it, dont rush ok, start by juggling the ball when you are ready... try to make a precise hit with NON-Dominant to perfectly set the ball to your Dominant as it it falls on your Dominant... get ready to perform an Outside Around the World as i said... as the ball is falling we perform an Outside Around The World but don't rush on performing the Around The World... most people rush because they think you got to do it fast... and then fail but it\u00b4s not performing it fast but at the exact time wait for the ball to be almost at floor level then ! try to perform the Outside Around The World This way we will get a low height Around The World that is exactly what we want, we don't want a high Around The World we need a really low Around The World Like this... As you can see, it is a low Around The World so perform the Low Height Around The World So... hit it and pass your leg over (ATW) BUT... don't jump until you foot is right next to the ball So perform Around The World (ATW) When you foot in position (next to the ball) we do step 2 which is hitting the ball under  and passing your other leg over like this... hit and pass leg over  it is important to wait for the correct time to jump correct time is when foot is next to the ball to then perform the jump and pass your leg over that is the most frequent error... people perform the Around The world and as they do it they jump right after thats when they fail So perform the Around The World and wait for the right moment which is when your foot is next to the ball just then... you make jump like this... low height Around The World wait for perfect timing... and perform the jump and hit okey that is basically it ! The most important is to wait for the exact time to perform the trick perfectly that is used a lot in Freestyle, \"Perfect timing\" so keep in it in mind it looks complex but if you follow the steps it is not that hard and you will get it with some training I hope you enjoyed todays tutorial Hit the Like button, it helps us a lot !

        "transcript": "hey there folks this is jordyn coming at you from follow Jordan comm with another episode of follow Jordan in this episode we're going back to LA papica we're making Paia last week you remember in valencia in case you forget let's go to this quick recap now if we remember our friend clavier took us through the steps and then we actually went into the kitchen and saw the paia being made in front of our very eyes and this is the process here it ends up right there and just simmers away and that's the last we saw of it and don't forget I embarrass myself for the second time by saying tail for no reason to the owner of la papica okay now while it's gonna be hard to match the excitement of last episode with all the action in the kitchen and the interview with the owner this episode is interesting for another reason because I just set the camera up on the corner of the table and recorded the entire scene and this is the edited version I'm going to show you every interaction that I had and so it's gonna be a longer period of time than you've seen me interact before and so you'll actually just see like how it went with me for me at this lunch where before the camera started before I even had a chance to set it up the owner came up to me and I had just we just talked about what I wanted I ordered verbally to him without seeing a menu or anything like that so I basically had no clue when I was getting which is often the case when you're traveling even like I speak Spanish but specific foods are very hard anyway bottom line is you never know what you're gonna get and I tend to like most things so it makes you think hey I should be a little bit more open-minded about the food I eat okay it hits animals IKEA stores doradito wanna see to deliver okay they got right back a let me go home Vivian toss our demo ha ha ha ha Celes honest honest care assume carnage at Cal State Fair do a split okay Turkish kebab esta Oh mother okay okay okay all right yeah choice at all okay no money at all we'll be okay Hama Hama a platter see okay garage garage yes that s kinda da s Corral is a plateau G yesterday's consumed comma and allow Indian dosa Libyan okay crackers I think they do to the perihelion Paquito yeah okay oh you know Tito Ramirez world okay okay no gram of time it's a bien okay I have no idea what most of that meant but uh this is like a roasted tomato with some olive oil I think we'll check it out and I'll look at the video and we'll see how right I am I'll be a fun game to play this is like all seafood and peppers so all of it is smoked this is tuna these pieces are tuna and this right here is bacalao I think he's already said and those are peppers with some oil and garlic bread okay now I think you have to admit that I did a pretty good job on the game there I believe I accurately described everything on the table missing an herb perhaps here or there and but just so you know he was using fancy names for food so instead of saying smoked tuna he was calling it Bahama and that's how it goes sometimes they don't know to use basic terms or even how to you sometimes to put it in like normal person's basic Spanish like two-year-olds manage basically okay that brings us to game number two in this episode and that is how many times does the lottery lady come by our table people in Spain it's kind of different like it's no matter how nice of a restaurant or how Ginji of a bar you're in there's always the possibility and the probability actually that somebody's gonna come into the restaurant and try to sell you something an umbrella a lighter or in this case lottery tickets so keep an eye on the lottery lady and let's see how many times she comes by our table oh well no this is definitely one of the weirdest experiences I've ever had okay no sympathy enter nothing I don't wanna come when you think about our ulema look there's just like a really crusty partner on the outside you wanna you know it's like you want to get some soft stuff some crispy stuff but generally speaking I'm a big believer in food getting better the longer it stands out I know it sounds crazy and most people think I'm disgusting well even eat a chicken sandwich with mayonnaise oh the camera shut off when I was talking what I was trying to say was I will even eat a chicken sandwich with mayonnaise on it that's been sitting on the counter for up to 45 48 hours it depends on the situation maybe even longer I'm just discussing like that I believe that food tastes better the longer it sits on the counter and this Paia I'm sorry I don't have the video footage for you this pile was a perfect example of this theory it was getting crustier and crust here and it's just so delicious and since then I've actually told this to a couple Spanish people and they confirm oh yes for sure that pie gets better the longer it sits out now I'm sure there's a point of diminishing returns but you get my drift esta bien para Sevilla gratis this is coffee oh there's like crazy things in it there's like beans of some kind fruit apple orange something I really have no idea how to drink this honestly I'm not that into the liquor in my coffee but I'll be nice and very good okay so that's my experience at lapa pika and I have to say I really enjoyed the experience it was a fun it was fun to like be in that nice restaurant right on the ocean there and also be interviewing everybody and stuff like that so they were super nice to me the service was awesome I really like the way the waiter talked he used those fancy words and he spoke with authority and he closed his mouth anyway bottom line is I really enjoyed my experience as far as the food goes the pie al was really good but my main problem is is I wish I had taken more care when ordering I don't know if I didn't ask enough questions or if I just didn't say what I wanted or if I didn't know what I wanted alright it realized what I was getting but the bottom line is is one what I would have done if I could do it over again was get the real pie with live animals everywhere I want legs and heads and tails I want to have no idea what I'm doing I want to embarrass myself I didn't know how to peel a shrimp until I was 22 years old bottom line is is it was delicious hey crazy scary animals but as it got older it was better so my lesson is just show up I guess there eat a little bit when it's hot but make sure you save room for 15-20 minutes later when it's nice and crusty and brown and awesome now I gotta say as far as the coffee goes that coffee was the worst coffee I've ever had I think in the video I said like as our coffee I was boasting that there was a culture in America all that bottom line is it was the worst coffee I've ever had of liquor in it and that's my lesson next time you don't want a coffee with liquor in it Jordan you say no liquor I didn't care her specialty I'm sorry you said than done bottom line is awesome experience everyone was super super nice and the food was really great it was a great day not getting hit I'll see you next time on follow Jory"

        "transcript": "what's up everyone Enz here and I got a gameplay for you of me on Team Deathmatch on underground I forgot this is a team deathmatch gameplay I'm going to be using the ksg2 and this is going to be a MOAB and I really was surprised when I got this because I suck with shotguns and I suck with the KSG um you'll see here that I switched through a couple of classes but eventually I get to the KSG right about n now there you go um I think I get most of the kills with the KSG if not I pick up a couple with the Kimbo pistols I use uh the setup I'm using right now is Extreme condition uh uh what is it Hardline and Steady Aim I was going to say like Assassin or something like that but my point strengths are assassin slide hand and scavenger um I don't really know of any sort of Port like strategy for a Shotgun If if you guys didn't know I'm completely terrible with shotguns I I have nothing to say about these things I've gotten two shotgun moabs in the past this guy's amazing freaking G36C Noob Tube I haven't gotten I've only gotten two shotgun mobs in my life and those were the uh those were two in a row not like two in a row but like I got one on on like Tuesday and one on Wednesday or something like that those are literally the only two shotgun moabs I've ever gotten in my life uh so if you guys are going for shotgun Moab tips uh I am not the place to go for that I to completely fail at this grenade I was like how did that not kill him so I get a free head shot I killed this guy like like two two times I think two or three times during the streak so yes I get a couple AFK kills uh but it doesn't really matter I don't care uh but anyways if you guys are looking for shotgun tips uh I am not the person to look for uh if you guys want uh tips on how to be good with a shotgun go to my friend mlc stealth his channel I guess I can link it in the description it's like Brett 1248 something like that it's like he has some terrible channel name uh but if you guys just look up uh mlc stealth in the YouTube you guys will find his channel if I don't link it if I'm too lazy he's bigger than me so it's not like it's like some like it's a shout out or anything but anyways uh so what I'm going to talk about is some things you might not be thinking of while you are playing this game and uh like if you want to get better at the game uh this one the first tip actually is something that a lot of people ask me about I don't know why they do I've said it a million times before um but a lot of people actually do think about this one it's what sensitivity to use uh what's the best sensitivity for getting a MOAB uh whatever you're comfortable with I honestly like if you want a super fast sensitivity then go get comfortable with one don't expect a MOAB like in 10 like in one game when you switch to a 10 sensitivity cuz you're probably going to start like freaking out and not get like a single kill uh if you guys don't know I do use 10 sensitiv I don't know why everyone seems to not believe me when I say that but I use 10 sensitivity 10 sensitivity it's I don't know why I've said it so many times yet people still ask me no do you really I'm like yes I do why would I lie um uh I don't know if you guys can tell from my gameplay that I do use a high sensitivity but it is 10 so again if you guys need a sensitivity use whatever you're comfortable with don't don't use anything like um you're you know out of your box and if you do want to get use something that's out of your box or out of your whatever whatever you want to call it um just be sure that you're that you know for a fact that you're going to have to get used to it after a while it took me about um probably like a day of playing for me to get used to 10 Sensitivity I wanted to use it because I thought it like I liked being able to move a lot U move around a lot faster and everything and I also used it just because um I don't know I like I just like the feeling of being free and like being able to move wherever I want I feel really constricted whenever I do um anything lower than 10 um one thing also want to note is that I I have a 23% accuracy and I know accuracy doesn't exactly mean gun skill but having a high accuracy is a lot better than having a low accuracy obviously this is a first person knifer I mean shooter and um you definitely want a higher accuracy if you're going to be able if you're going to be um playing this game so if you're if you notice your accuracy is going really far down and you've been like if you've been bumping up your sensitivity a lot recently try going back to his lower one just because it's it's going to make it easier on yourself and you definitely want a higher accuracy rather than a lower accuracy uh another thing I want to mention is one thing that Ronaldinho has uh figured out recently uh he he used to play on a 70in TV I don't know how he managed to do that and he played like 10 ft away from his TV if at all possible try moving closer to your TV cuz right now if I stick my arm out I can touch my TV screen that's how close I am to it uh it's a 34 in DX uh computer monitor sltv I use it as my computer monitor and a TV it's um it it is a pretty big screen for a computer monitor but it's a normal siiz TV it uh I really like it it has a 7 millisecond uh response time and for comparison the people in MLG they use a monitor that has a 2 millisecond response time so um it's not the best TV to use so I wouldn't recommend it uh but uh that's just another thing to think about how far away are you from your TV do you have to actually physically move your head around to see something or do you just move your eyes uh if you guys if you guys are moving moving your head around definitely definitely try and get a better point of view on your TV try and get like something that's you know a little bit closer something that you or maybe further away maybe you're too close to it Whatever It Is try and make it so you can you only have to move your eyes around the screen and not your entire head uh those are just two tips I didn't have enough time to get anything else in really but hopefully you guys did enjoy that hopefully you guys did you know hopefully this helped you in any sort of way thank you guys for listening see you for"

        "transcript": "hi i'm cassie jay le course and i'm here at legendary beads in austin texas and i'd like to talk to you today about making a wire wrap gemstone for a wire wrap necklace here's an example of a beautiful wire wrap gemstone pendant and as you can see the wire wrap is actually a design element that i made the bail and then brought it down over the cap of this piece of moss aquamarine some other applications are for this necklace here you can see there's multiples dropped down in the same fashion these are all top drills and i'm going to show you in a minute how to do that so today i'm going to be taking this piece of rutilated quartz and i'm going to make a pendant out of it so one thing that's important to learn is that i initially took a 24 gauge wire and it went in one side of my top drill but didn't come out the other which is very very typical of briolette styles so i needed to take a 26 gauge wire which fits nicely through so the technique with the top drill is to put the wire through leave one short side and one long side and then you bring the two together above the peak of the bead and you make an x across right here with my chain nose pliers i'm going to grasp directly above the x not at not at the wire crossing or else you'll break the wire but right above it i'm going to utilize the bead and i'm going to twist the wires together you can see that the twist is crawling down towards the peak of the bead then i'm going to cut off my short guy and i'm going to use the rest of my wire to make the bail so i'm going to take the bead in my left hand and i'm going to make a 90 degree bend in that wire i'm going to take my round nose i'm going to grasp that perpendicular and when you're doing this and you're making a bail which bail just means that it goes over the necklace chain you're actually going to consider where on the round nose that you grab because the further up gives you a larger bail so if you've got some really heavy chain you have to keep that in mind in this instance i've got some pretty delicate chain that i'm going to put this guy on so what i'm going to do is i'm going to use my hand and i'm going to bring the wire over the top of my tool and i'm going to twist my right hand wrist just a bit whilst tucking at the same time underneath with the wire to complete my loop i can even double check if i'd like to make sure that that loop is going to fit with my chain and it does so now i'm going to stabilize this loop since i've got a nice loop and by stabilizing i mean you grab with your round nose across both sides of your bail or the round part i'm going to take my chain nose i'm going to grab it at the end very tip of the wire and i'm going to start at my loop and work down towards the bead and what this does is it actually covers your original twist don't be afraid to pull while you twist and the original twist kind of effects then how far and how much wire you need to successfully get all the way to the top of the bead so that takes a little bit of thought process so it's a little kitty wampus but i can straighten that out i'm going to take my cutters i'm going to get in there i'm going to cut the little tail off i'm going to take my chain nose and in a pinch pinch the little tail in and under so that it doesn't catch on anybody's skin or clothing and then you can see here see how i've got a little bit of a twist in my thing as long as i stabilize that i can straighten it so here you have a wire wrap gemstone wire wrap gemstone that you can then dangle onto a chain to become a necklace which is what i'm going to do now and there you go all i need is a a clasp and i'm all set this is another technique for gemstone wire wrapping for a necklace and as you can see this is a classic linked chain with wire wrap sections but what i've done is i've taken a briolette and in this instance it's pyrite and i've done a top drill wire wrap to dangle it from the chain at different moments and points for a really interesting look you"
