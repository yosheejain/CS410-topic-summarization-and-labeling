        "transcript": "hey guys this is Trevor daily hey I wanted to share another quick Lightroom tip with you all uh this one today has to do with using colors in your photos and what I mean by that is how to actually manipulate those colors in Lightroom whether you want to add more or less or take away from so here's what we're going to do I'm going to bring you over into Lightroom and I just picked out six photos from a recent wedding we're going to first go over to this uh hsl color and black and white menu hsl stands for huge saturation luminance now you can if you click on that you can be in this menu bar I can talk about this one later in a future video and where and how I use it especially this little button right over here it's kind of a secret little tip there but today we're going to go back to this one under color now under color you can see I have Hue saturation luminance for each of my color spectrums now where I use this is when I'm shooting jewelry for example a lot of times I will get uh different yellows and oranges that are reflecting around the room from whether it be the ambient light or whatever and what I want to do is I don't necessarily want to get all the color I mind I don't mind a little bit of color reflecting in the diamond but I don't want that overwhelming orange now of course some people might say well Trevor you could go up and adjust your color white balance which I could but what happens is sometimes you'll get lights and things reflecting off that diamond so what I really want to do is I'm going to come over here to my color menu and I'm going to actually just take my yellows and I'm going to pull the saturation down now you'll see when I do that I still maintain some of the Blues and other colors that are reflecting the diamond but I got rid of that overwhelming yellow that was reflecting or that room that was reflecting back in it so that's one of the tips I love using now let's go take another photo this one was shot in the hotel room as well and you're going to see we have this overwhelming yellow that's kind of just overtaking this photo same thing guys I can take this yellow saturation pull that down and immediately I just got rid of all that ugly yellow in the room and I'm able to show off those white curtains so just a quick little tip there now let's take that same idea let's open up a photo that we have a little bit of Sky we have the couple getting down here getting married and let's just say I want to really saturate or I even to darken those Blues well instead of going into exposure and trying to pull those Blues down or maybe creating a radio filter or you know doing something like that what I can do is I can just come over to my color menu I can go down to my blues and I can do one of two things I can bring the luminance down which is basically the how light they are so there you can see automatically I'm starting to pull back those Blues now I don't want it to look fake of course but um let's just bring that back by the way if you want to just zero those out just click on the name or I could even bring the saturation up so I can kind of bring those saturation I can do a combination of both now if I really want to get crazy I can even change the color of this guy you can see now again there would be no purpose in doing that but you can see the power in these little color sliders so let me zero those out again by the way another quick little tip is if I just if I have these all kind of wacking if I just want to zero them out if I hold down the uh option key or control key on the PC I can then get where it says reset so again let's just pick something that looks kind of decent there we go with the color slider when a mere seconds I just changed that now here's another example in this one what I want to do is let's just say I want those greens to really pop you can kind of see right now they have kind of a yellow tone to them and right now it's real popular this kind of film look that has those kind of minty greens well guys just really easy to do I just come right over to Hughes in the green slider and if I just click that over just a little bit you can see immediately my greens went from kind of this yellow into more of a real nice dark saturated green same thing I can bring down the saturation I can bring up the saturation I can even change the Lumin it so I can make it darker greens which of course we don't want to go too much but or I can go lighter greens so you can see the power of those sliders let's just do it one more time here same thing I'm going to hit those minty greens and then maybe I'll just bring up the saturation a little bit and I'll bring up the luminance a little bit and lastly let's just do it one more time this one you can really see we got those yellows you got we got those you know real bright yellows and those greens let's just take those greens over a little bit let's actually take my yellows change that Hue just a tiny bit okay and maybe we want to desaturate those yellows just a little bit as well so again you can see the power of these sliders now what I like to do is instead of taking every photo and going in here and adjusting the sliders I'll typically come up with a look that I like and just save that as a preset and when you save it as a preset you can say I just want my color sliders to be checked and that way you can always go back and it will you know as you hit that preset it will apply those color sliders to each photo so imagine for a minute you have one slider or one preset that says hey you know for my blue skies and it will change CH your Blues so that your you know your Hues are up your saturations are up your luminance is down a little bit Your Greens let's say you want that those real saturated greens so there's plenty of different opportunities here guys as I mentioned before I use it a lot in jewelry to desaturate those yellows and I also use it when I want to make sure those greens have that real nice tone green color so hopefully this tip was useful I know I use it a lot hopefully you can as well thanks for watching guys take care"

        "transcript": "hi guys it's Vanessa I'm here I'm doing a little Vlog um just to kind of put a video up I haven't put a video up in a while and I'm feeling guilty about it but I have a very good excuse I promise um it's just been really bad weather here in Chicago like a lot of thunderstorms today was like a crazy whole tornado um warning thing it's just been really bad storming and I think it's slowing down my already crappy um internet connection so I have a video that I've been trying to upload my glamour doll eyes haul and review for literally like a week already um if you follow me on Twitter every day I'm like I'm uploading the video and it always like stops or something happens the internet connection gets disrupted or something and since it's um an HD video whenever I upload um videos from my bloggy camera it takes and I'm not exaggerating at all like 3 to 4 hours for a video to load so um that's why I'm using this webcam by the way because this will just upload really fast and this was me more of like an update just to let you guys know that I am in fact um still making videos I'm not trying to take a break or anything it's just that the shitty weather mixed with my shitty internet connection is causing delays so I really apologize for that and it looks like I have a unibrow I think it's cuz of these but um anyways yeah so I just wanted to come and say that um to look out for that video it will be coming up soon um and what else I should do some housekeeping now that I'm here um I have I bought like a few things this week nothing like super major but I do have a haul I have like two or three hauls that I really need to do um of things that people sent me um Jessica whose name I always forget gem something I'll put the numbers um she sent me like the most generous um like stuff she just sent me it wasn't even a swap she just sent it to me I'm going to have to put it up there my girl Ashley Holland Kitty she sent me some stuff like months ago that I still haven't put up here um and then I have a couple of things from NYCB so I really like um at first I was just like you know what times pass I'm not going to put it up but I feel like when people um are nice enough to send you something that you should really publicly thank them and um give them the credit that's due so probably next week um hopefully it won't be um raining as much um so I'll be able to put up kind of a bunch of hauls I I anticipated to be like haul week sorry I keep moving um but yeah so that's that um as far as videos to come and I apologize now cuz I know not everyone loves hauls but I like hauls so yeah um what else oh I wanted to mention and I never know when to fit this in so this is a good video to do it um friend request I really appreciate that you guys um want to friend request me on YouTube but here's the thing I'm no longer accepting friend request for the the only fact that I I truly see no purpose in accepting them and I don't mean that in a mean way because let me just say that I love interacting with my subscribers I love talking to you guys on comments on um private message on Twitter however else you can reach me please by all means do um I just don't see the benefit in the friends thing on YouTube so I just I tend to not accept them and I'm not accepting them this is my official thing I'm not accepting any friend requests anymore on YouTube and I don't mean that um to offend anyone or to be mean or selective or bougie or whatever I just honestly I just don't see the benefit of it so if there is a benefit comment below and let me know because I really I don't know it so that's that um but please comment um video response um private message me or follow me on Twitter and I'm not just saying that to get like followers and comments and whatever I really do like hearing from my subscribers um and I really like if I could help you I like helping you out if you could help me so I really feel like um you know YouTube's a community so it makes sense for us to interact like I don't want to just be talking at you I want to be talking with you so yes reach out to me on all those um different Avenues if you can um what else I wanted to say thank you I haven't said a subscriber thank you in a while let's see how many I have right now I haven't checked in a bit one second YouTube 2,977 thank you so much I really really appreciate it um yeah thank you guys so much I don't know what to say that's like super awesome um I've been doing videos for a while now like literally I think it's been almost 2 years Years it'll be 2 years in August that I've been doing videos so it's been a while um but I totally love doing videos and I really appreciate um anyone who and everyone who subscribes to me comments writes all that good stuff thank you so much um so yes consider this my formal thank you for my updated subscriber count um so I think that's about it subscribers videos to come I told you that I'm going to be doing a lot of hauls um I antip be doing a lot more reviews I kind of suck at tutorials so I've been contemplating whether I'm going to just not do them anymore I mean I've never liked how I do tutorials it's just not my forte I guess um the only reason that I ever do looks is because they're requested or because I just want to show people um on YouTube like I think that and I don't mean this um to offend anyone but I think that there's a lot of people on YouTube who are a little bit snobby in like they think that like because they can do like super awesome face mask masks and super precise eyeliner and something about the tone in a lot of tutorials that I've seen in the past is a little snobby so the reason that I always wanted to do tutorials is to be like this liner is not perfectly straight this isn't like the most amazing Blended but it works it looks this is everyday makeup I'm an everyday person and I wear my makeup like this so that's kind of the main reason I even did tutorials to begin with um when I do do them but I just kind of don't like them I don't feel like I'm so blind you can never get a good angle and whatever and the thing that I really truly enjoy doing are the Splurge versus deals even though I know I drag to put them out it does take a while to do them but that's probably my favorite thing to do um as well as I love love love doing product reviews so if you have any product reviews um on any products you've seen on my channel um definitely comment I will be more than happy to do them and then um let me know if you think it's wor I mean I will not get offend that if you're like you can stop doing tutorials I won't cry cuz honestly like I'm kind of almost over tutorials in my my YouTube life I've been watching videos for so long that I personally just like seeing what people bought and their opinions on it um not so much like how they put it on so yeah that's all um yeah that's it I guess I don't want to make this too long it was just supposed to be a quick little update so look out for the glamour doll eyes um haul review that'll be up very soon um hopefully tomorrow I can put it up all right guys I'll talk to you later and yeah take care bye"

        "transcript": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the makeup Gourmet uh today's recipe is summer makeup and with me is beautiful Lucy botos and I'm going to show you how to do beautiful summer makeup so let's get started now you always want to prepare your skin by moisturizing and such things before you start doing the application of your makeup so first thing I'm going to start off with is a primer which is a little bit goldy and shimmery I'm going to put this all over her skin what what this is going to do it's going to give her a beautiful Sheen that sort of sets up the summer color so with the foundation brush I'm going to brush this you can see how it immediately catches light and now her face has that beautiful Golden summery Glow and I like to isolate the cheeks mostly but then with a little bit less on my brush I'm going to apply it directly to the forehead take it down the nose across the chin and this way the whole face gets this beautiful Golden Glow this color is actually a bit of an apricotty color so it adds that nice peachy sort of gold which is also very pretty to look at all right so now let's do some really really pretty colors for summer eyes now summer eyes I want gorgeous gorgeous golden color all right these shades are designed to make the eyes pop and open up we have gold orange a beautiful deep green and then a nice Brown so I'm going to start first I think with let's start first with the gold color I'm going to take the gold and I'm going to put that gold right up under Lucy's brow right up here give it a nice gold pop do that over on the other side as well just tapping and pressing that color into place already we're starting to see the gold come out of her skin come out of her eyes next we're going to take this beautiful coral color close please and I'm going to press this onto wow look at that color happen it just picks right up so I'm pressing this right into the lid of the eye trying to avoid getting too much of a spill so instead of rubbing my brush back and forth patting and pressing that color into shape now what's beautiful about this shade as you can see is it really sets up that terracotta golden orange sort of a sunburnt Mediterranean eye just by using two colors we've already established a beautiful summer look on her eyes but you know let's go for some drama let's go for some intensity with this look so next we're going to use uh the beautiful green now this color I'm going to use as her Contour shade so close for me starting in the outer Corner we're going to take this gorgeous teal now this teal green has a lot of Shimmer in it so I want you to be sparingly used you use it but definitely wrap that color from the outer Corner the eye in get it greens are beautiful summer colors they contrast really nice with the golds and the oranges and really makes the eye pop open for me wow look at that opens up her eye nice and big she can really carry these kinds of tones off and then go right back to the other side do the exact same thing always starting from the outer Corner blending in making that color work gorgeous now when you're doing summer eyes sometimes that means you're going to be experiencing summer conditions that means it could be warm outside and what have you so you want to make sure that the liner that you're using around your eye area is conducive to a warm climate you don't want your makeup to be running smearing in the heat so there's many waterproof pencils out there you can use to make the eye uh withstand the heat now I choose um using a gel liner because I think it's going to hold up real well but I'm using a really bright green because I really want to make her eyes pop so I'm going to take my brush close for me and I'm going to run this bright green right across her lash bed now I don't want to be shy with this I really want this color to be noticed sometimes when you do liner what you want to do is you want to bring out the shape of the eye you want to make the lashes look a little bit thicker but with this makeup it is about color remember that you are showing off color you're still staying within your own eye intensity but you want to make color happen and let's do the same thing under her eye this is where it'll really show off look up please and then right here under her eye is that tickling is that okay all right get right in there inside your eye pull down a little bit look at that green pick up her eye color that is really really pretty same thing other side test take that brush tickle it right in there really makes your eyes pop all right now for lips I love a warm red for Summer Okay a red that's got a lot of coral in it now with Lucy's coloring she can carry off wearing a red because she already has a medium dark skin tone so we're going to take this color we're going to work it right across her lips and we're going to stain it whoa that color just totally pops this completely changes the look now when you look at her her makeup both eyes and lips grab us at the same time and summer makeup is all about being flashy but not flashy in a dark intense sort of nighttime way more in a colorful way these are the most saturated colors these are like grownup spring colors so you get this gorgeous and just Mash your lips together for me perfect look at that gorgeous then if you want to give it a little bit of a heightening then I suggest picking up just a little bit of a coral gloss adding a little bit of of coral gloss just on the center of the mouth the nice vertical Strokes to give your uh your lips that little extra pop all right let's move on to the cheeks and I'm going to use a uh bronzing powder for the cheeks uh and what I want you to do is work generally across the cheekbone you can do a little more chisel under the cheekbone if you like same thing on the other on the other side chisel that cheekbone all right you notice I'm being pretty generous with the bronzer because this is where we want to isolate the eye makeup so by taking bronzer across the forehead down the nose across the chin and up on the cheekbone what we do is we isolate this area here this area maintains a lighter skin tone and so it really makes her eyes pop a lot because the light comes up into the eyes also remember when you're doing all of this makeup uh that you want to use waterproof mascara again for the obvious reason that it's summertime and you may be experiencing more heat or of course going into pools and such things all right last thing I want show you his Summer Body because even though you've already done your self tanner or what have you we have these beautiful products with tons of Shimmer I like this one even more big old brush right shake shake shake let me see your arms and this way you give your body a beautiful shimmery glow wow that looks beautiful same thing on the other side just run it up and down your arms and let your body glow now if you choose to share your deete then what I suggest is really show it off so really wrap that color right around the dec L this way so that you get this beautiful pop skin tone looks gorgeous and take it up under your neck as well try not to leave any area untouched so that it looks nice and smooth and even wow there it is beautiful summer makeup remember the focus is on gorgeous grownup colors colors that are rich in intensity Golds bronze all those colors that really make this look happen and also remember go with a strong lip color if you dare because it really does sell the look thank you so much Lucy so when we come

test the latest in technology if it survives we'll give it away to you guys if it doesn't we destroy it spectacularly today we're bringing you the iPhone 5 versus Samsung Galaxy [Music] S3 So today we're drop testing the iPhone 5 we're taking it from 4 ft and dropping it on its back on its side and on it front and we're going to see how it stands up we're also going to be comparing it to the Galaxy S3 which we already drop tested we're just curious and excited to see how they compare but anyway let's go ahead and get to it oh and by the way we've got a couple TV stations from around Houston here to film us today all right wave wave there he is all right guys this is the 4ft drop onto its back in three 2 1 one well I am only seeing scuffs at the moment there's only like a little scratch on the side like a little Nick here but the the back is definitely intact that's definitely a win for the iPhone 5 because the iPhone 4 and 4S would definitely not take a fall like that because of the glass back so the iPhone 5 survived the 4ot drop onto its back let's go on to the S3 and see how it did three two one all right guys let's take a look at how it did picking it up looked like it stopped recording but it uh looks like the device is completely okay need a closeup on it oh look at that the camera actually cracked the glass over the camera actually cracked that's actually uh never seen that happen before so this is the 4ft drop onto its Corner 3 2 [Applause] 1 all right guys so let's go ahead and check that out and see how this did well it's definitely a little bit more of an indentation but it's not a cracked screen at all the back and front are fine let's turn this on yeah it's turning on it's reacting seems to be just fine right now the iPhone 5 definitely just survived its drop onto its side let's go ahead and see how the Galaxy S3 did dropping it on the corner and three 2 one [Music] all right guys as you can see it actually broke really badly from the corner upward all the way to the top right the screen actually separated from the back right here but I'm going to try to push that down okay so that that went back together so really it's just the screen that's cracked really bad and this corner is is mashed up pretty badly too so unfortunately this did not survive we're going to be drop testing this on its face in just a second but now a word from our sponsors so this week we're brought to you by the Nissan Innovation garage you see Nissan's put together this initiative that's based on the idea that many of the most influential ideas

        "transcript": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] hello this is Ryan from n gamer and a word of warning before you begin playing battle block theater do not start with a multiplayer the reason for that is if you jump into multiplayer like I did you'll see the only weapon you have is a mine thrower which sounds good but it's actually about as effective as farting in the wind and every other player because I have done single player first will have grenades fans Fireballs paper planes with C4 exploding frogs all sorts and you'll just die over and over [Music] [Music] again the reason I jumped into multiplayer first is I presumed it' be a multiplayer game but actually it's got a really good campaign where you can unlock these weapons so it's not actually that bad a place to startop in case you're wondering how campaign relates to the whole idea of not playing multiplayer first you actually find balls of yarn while playing through each level and this is what you use as currency to buy new weapons there are also gems scattered throughout the levels that you can use to trade in for prisoners which is just a fancy way of saying that you can unlock new heads for your [Music] character but as you play Campaign you realize it's worth playing anyway just because of the way the levels have been designed it's obviously a platform but there are a lot of puzzle elements thrown in as well and it is pretty challenging but also the art style and the humor if you know the bouth from Alien homid and Castle Crashes will be familiar and recognizable it is a funny game it is a challenging game and it is definitely worth playing campaign [Music] as you play through you'll notice nice little touches in design which are pretty simple but fun to play through like the Tower of coal blocks that you have to sort of bounce your way through to the little fan that straps through your back and takes you through a valley of spikes safely all right another gem [Music] levels also throw enemies at you who chase after you and try and knock you into the pits of Doom they're probably the main thing that will frustrate you in the game because they're the one thing that's I guess unpredictable and can't be learned but because checkpoints are so generous it's never really that frustrating when you [Music] [Applause] [Music] die oh so campaign's good but really the whole point for playing it is to collect gems and to collect these balls of yarn so you can unlock heads and weapons to use in the multiplayer modes that make [Music] it the reason multiplayer is so fun is it's kind of like a party game there are loads of different modes and maps to play on and they're not particularly deep but it's messy it's chaotic it's fun and it's really accessible as well what helps make it stand out are all the different weapons that people have and the different customizations which has the kind of natural feeling of Envy of stuff that you want to collect yourself which then takes you back to campaign to unlock more stuff and so on and [Music] so the best modes are Muckle which is kind of like a team deathmatch mode it's just everyone flinging weapons at each other whoever gets the highest score wins horse where you have to ride a horse to your opposing team stable sort of like Capture the Flag mode and this one which is called ball game the idea of ball game is that football drops down in the middle of the level and you have to take it to the opposing team's goal and score it sounds easy but again this is a game where you have grenades exploding frogs C4 show yukin people punching each other it's again very messy but a hell of a lot of fun the big question for this game is really how long multiplayer will last you because it's not particularly deep it is a game that relies on the fact that it has so many modes and so many maps to keep you play it but in any case for a game that has a party mode esque multiplayer this actually has a really good single player mode so either way there's plenty of stuff to play single player last about 8 hours or so and because it's got a ranking system and because the game game can be quite challenging it is a game that you'll come back to and you'll want to improve your rank on it's definitely worth checking out ble block theater not just if you're a fan of the B previous titles alien hom Castle Crashes but just if you like good fun multiplayer games the campaign's pretty cool but definitely play this with the multiplayer which is a lot of fun and because the modes are so weird and so different it stands out as unique as well [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]"

model rd8 series 1H became the model d8 in 1937 and it was produced up until 1941 when it was replaced with the newer 8r series which is what you're looking at right here caterpillar records indicate that almost 10,000 1H series tractors were built up until 1941 at the time of its replacement now the 8r series looked much like the older rd8 but the 8r series was much more mechanically refined and in its day this was an unbeatable dozing machine and as you can see this part particular Adar is equipped with an RG lero model K8 bulldozer it wasn't until 1945 when caterpillar started building its own blades after the termination of the joint marketing agreement between RG lerno and caterpillar in 1944 this is a cable machine okay there are no hydraulics on this Dozer and right here in the front you can see where the cables run down connect to the the bottom sheets on the top of the Dozer blade and this is basically all you get on one of these older cable dozers the ability to raise the blade up or lower it down there's no hydraulic control you can't angle the blade to the left or right or up and down and this is really what made these oldtime operators who would run these old cable machines so skilled and talented because to know how to dig with a machine like this and move dirt takes a skilled operator right here on the side of the radiator you can see where it says caterpillar the ARR is powered by caterpillar's outstanding d13000 inline 6-cylinder diesel engine this was the exact same engine used in the earlier model rd8 which produced 95 draw bar horsepower and 110 belt horsepower by 1941 this engine was producing 113 draw bar horsepower and 131 belt horsepower in 8r and for those who don't know what draw bar horsepower is it's basically the measurement of power available for a tractor to pull an Implement now let's go up on top of the Dozer here you can get a good overview of the operator station on the ADR I'll take and show you what some of these controls do and explain to you how you'd run this Dozer now in the front here this hand lever you see is to turn the pony motor over to start the Dozer and if you look on the front here on the hood you can see you only have two gauges for the fuel pressure and the water temperature now all of these hand levers and controls may look kind of confusing to run this machine but in reality once you learn this control setup it's relatively very simple okay these two foot pedals you see on the floor are track brakes the right pedal is the right track brake and the left pedal is the left track brake this hand lever that you see on the left side works the clutch these two hand levers you see out in front are the steering clutches this is how you steer the tractor and this big hand lever you see over here is the gear shift for the transmission this Dozer has a six-speed manual transmission it's the same transmission that was used in the model rd8 now in the newer 2u series which was introduced in 1945 those tractors had a 5-speed manual transmission and this hand lever that you see on the right side over here works the cable control unit on the back of the Dozer we'll go and take a look at that in a minute and here you can see what's left of the operator seat and right behind the operator seat this is the diesel fuel tank okay okay on the back of the tractor this is what's called the cable control unit this acts basically as a winch in fact a lot of guys will often call this a winch but the correct term for it is a cable control unit basically all this does is reel the cable in or reel it out you can see where the cable is reeled around the drum right here it runs out and it runs through that top bar that goes over the Dozer and down to pick the blade up and down now this particular cable control unit has two drums one right here which is working the Dozer blade and the other one over here which you can see is not in use this one was optional and this is if the tractor were pulling a scraper Pan the operator would wrap the cable around here and run it up to the scraper this particular drum would be worked by a different hand lever and this would work a scraper if the tractor were pulling one and right here you can get another good view of caterpillar's d13000 diesel engine a lot of guys will often say that this engine was bulletproof and right here you can see just how thick and strong the frame is on this tractor everything on this machine is heavy duty the ADR is also famous for playing an important role in helping the United States and its allies in World War I thousands of these ADR tractors were shipped overseas to assist in the war effort in the 1940s the overall working weight of this tractor with the K8 bulldozzer that you see right here here is 17 tons the ADR series was replaced by the 2u Series in 1945 which had a much longer production run than the older 8r series did there were many improvements that were made to the Tractor such as the replacement of the dry type clutch with an oil clutch the tractor itself had more power and the 2u series was the first to receive a new radiator Grill front end design in early 1950 the last of the d8 tractors to be powered by the 13,000 engine and follow in the 2u series design was the 13A series those tractors were built from 1953 to 1955 they were also the most powerful up to 185 Hors power but there she is a classic 1944 caterpillar ADR series d8 equipped with an RG lero model K8 bulldozer where"

        "transcript": "[Music] logistic keyboards have been very popular within the Gaming Community particularly due to the integration of the LCD screen that can showcase various useful information for gaming but also desktop use so we're checking out the g510s which retails for $120 which is the same price tag as the original g510 so let's check out exactly what has changed on this new keyboard so the g510s features a new coding on the keyboard which is supposed to make the keyboard more durable the keys now feature double UV coding so generally prolonging the top surface of the keys Logitech also says they've added a fingerprint resistant coating on the frame which is the darker blue portion but it is highly reflective in a huge fingerprint magnet so keeping the keyboard clean will require a wipe here and there the keyboard's physical characteristics haven't changed uh from the original g510 we still get a built LCD display with the 18 programmable G Keys uh but one main disappointment and I'm sure many will agree are the keys are non- mechanical so we do have these General membrane switches and considering the direction of most gaming keyboards today a mechanical version of the g510 would be a complete knockout the keyboard however has a solid build quality no complaints there and comes with a very nice Palm rest uh that simply attaches to the bottom of the keyboard it's not the exactly rubberized but it does elevate your palm for a more comfortable typing experience so starting off with some of the gaming features the W ASD keys are of different color but uh that's about it they have the exact same surface as the rest of the keys so in terms of functionality the gray color is simply for Aesthetics now the 18 programmable Keys is one of the main highlights of this keyboard so for strategy gaming MMOs RPGs and also for simulators this would be ideal they're very easy to program with the macro record button uh you choose your G key type in your desired command and you're all set to go now not only is this very useful for gaming but for editing and other application as well you just have to remember what key does what now we do have three different modes to choose from so each profile can register up to 54 different functions for the G Keys now it may be a little Overkill but for those who can use it right it will do the job job well now each mode also comes with its own color customization for differentiation the Windows key can be disabled with a dedicated switch uh to avoid accidental disturbance during gaming now the keyboard despite connecting through a single USB port supports headphones and a microphone Jack so an internal sound card is installed inside the g510s and it wasn't actually half bad for regular music and entertainment purposes for gaming and directionality of course the dedicated sound card is uh more suited but it's a very welcomed feature for just regular desktop use also these can be individually muted which makes monitoring your audio a little easier and the internal sound card is only activated once you populate the 3.5 mm Jacks so it will not interfere with uh other audio devices now moving on to sort of the main highlight of the keyboard is the LCD screen this is a monochrome display that uh has some versatile functionality ities not only for gaming but for productivity as well we get things like performance monitor profile switch and even a news feed and countdown and stopwatch and a regular clock as well we do get a whole bunch of gaming profiles from the software menu that you can add to the keyboard and it shows all the game specific functions that you can uh assign to your G Keys simply by dropping them onto the button Grid it's very intuitive and works very well the keyboard's built-in memory allows you to store 30 15 different profiles so if you rely heavily on those G keys for gaming and also for other applications all of your profiles stay with the keyboard and not with the software now moving on the turning off the backl is also an option and we get plenty of colors to choose from along with the brightness adjustments this is an excellent way to match the lighting of your keyboard to the rest of your gaming peripherals and we also get the usual media controls with a nice volume knob and a large mute button and it's also that these are separate buttons and not integrated into your F Keys the keyboard can slightly be angled uh and elevated with these retractable feet at the bottom but notice there's only two anti-g gliding pads so the keyboard is prone to Sliding with or without the feet and it's actually quite frustrating having the keyboard dance on the table while you're gaming now my overall impression with using the keyboard has been satisfactory the backlit keys are really awesome in dark environments and everything function like should the 18g keys uh with the three modes turn this into 54 different programmable functions which is a bit Overkill but nevertheless it's there for our use the included Palm breast is very comfortable for typing and the LCD display provides us with a few extra goodies for in-game statistics and some other functions and also the build in audio jacks while may not be comparable to a dedicated sound card provide a decent quality audio for desktop use and lastly the number of different gaming profiles that are compatible with the keyboard really make this an attractive gaming keyboard however the new anti-fingerprint coating is kind of a fail this piano gloss finish on the face plate is a huge fingerprint magnet now it doesn't disturb the function of the keyboard but the S within the name stands for surface and it just feels like they dropped ball in a slight exterior renovation and they should really focused on the internals by giving us the mechanical switches and also aside from the features the price is bit on the Steep side compared to some of the mechanical competition but regardless of the new glossy coating the g510s still serves as a great gaming keyboard just with a disappointing upgrade but nevertheless we're giving in the hardw conu damn good award so thanks guys for watching and we'll see you in the next one"

        "transcript": "60 years ago Lee Wolf the pioneering Alaskan angler and pilot came across a place where brook trout grow bigger than anywhere else in the world minipi hidden away in the wild interior of Labrador he discovered a system of lakes and rivers that no Sports fisherman had ever visited before he knew it was special from the moment he saw the color of the water from the air it is a place where World Records have been broken a place where I could realize my dream of catching a trophy brook trout a truly North American Icon Jack Cooper meets this week's party of Anglers at Goose Bay's sea plane Basin Jack has been running camps on the minipi system for 40 years now and some faithful client have been coming every year for almost as long from here the lodge on anmarie lake is over an hour's flight away this was how Lee wolf first explored the area in the 1950s from the air he would fly his Piper Cub float plane over the lakes and streams of the Interior landing and fishing where he thought it looked good he quickly adopted a rule of thumb for where to put down based on the color of the water if it was very dark and tan the fish tended to be stunted and if it was very clear the water tended to be too acidic to support the Aquatic Life on which the brook trout feed water the color of strong tea was what he was looking for rich in insects and big brookies when he landed on the manii system he believed he had found the best brook trout fishery in the world this is Ralph he from Newland but he's been guiding on the manii lakes for 15 Summers now he's taking me Downstream to the river that flows out of anmarie Lake we start fishing on a stretch that looks like where wolf filmed his famous sequence of catching three brookies on one cast our script was to be somewhat different every fisherman remembers the first fish they ever caught I caught mine in Canada at the age of two a tiny trout in a tiny stream in Ontario a brook trout I didn't catch another one for 40 years but when I did in the far north of Quebec fishing for Arctic char I realized how important that little Brookie had been to me and how little I actually knew about them coming to minipi in search of a trophy brook trout was a way to ReDiscover where fishing had begun for me all right we're waiting down towards going towards here yeah take your way here first and and work your way down so we took three boats to get here where are we this is Harvey's hole all right start with the stimulator first have a few cast across there and let it drift down here cast across let it drift yeah am I looking to try and get it to skate on the surface yeah you have to try to skate it over the surface you're exactly right so stripping quite yeah fast because of course the fast moving water as you can see yeah so uh you we'll try the stimulator then we'll try Mouse okay give him a better some more better Morel to feed on I guess well let's get this fly wet and I want to go all the way over yeah far as you can reach or you can reach over there okay keep it short to start with yeah and fishing right the way into the bank no you're doing fine they're uh Sebastian okay you've obviously had a few [Laughter] casts very kind of you to say so I guess since I was about eight was when I first started fly fishing should I put it all the way out to start off with or go all across so Ralph this mouse pattern what's it supposed to be imitating it's supposed to be imitating Artic leming mhm and they will of course eat those when they're Crossing into the waters here the lemon cross the water oh yes so actually it's not it forms part of their natural diet Lem the well no it's also an a tractor too like like a bomber for example more of a tractor speaking of bomber you probably should try bomber too okay I don't know I'm going to say now so you've been caught with one of these before yourself Ralph uh as a matter of fact I have yeah bet that smarted so Ralph you been caught with any other flies yes and I prefer to be caught with barous ones any particular pattern no they all feel alike actually Sebastian yeah you probably should try a mudler there too a mudler yeah cuz that mouth doesn't seem to be doing much not yet what sort of size mudler then six or eight or something brought those for pike pike yeah poppers yeah are they good for pike oh yeah yeah yeah yeah of course P will take anything choose it yeah good hopefully the modeler goes subsurface if not you probably try streamer after a few casts do you normally see the activity on the surface in these streamy parts as well well uh Sometimes they come up and take them eh uh and more times you know you you the streamers or the modelers that go subsurface you can uh they come up and get those in an age when a fish caught was a fish killed Lee wolf was an early advocate for catch and release for him a game fish was too valuable to be caught only once I have come to agree with him but at this point once would have been fine with me back on the main Lake something finally takes my fly Mr Lucius I think it's f as well years ago when the aboriginals here see the pike was the food the fish of choice right and the brook Tru was fish for dog for dog oh that has changed h [Music] la [Music]"

        "transcript": "[Music] come [Music] [Music] Ian and I have been out here in the woods riding the new KTM 1190 for several days now we've been comparing it to the 990 and just trying to get a sense for what the differences are between the two bikes and what we can expect from this new [Music] bike I love the brakes on that thing and I think the suspension for that heavy of a bike for the extra pounds they've added the suspension is is incredible well the new bikes got a ton more power we knew that uh it's got incredible brakes we kind of knew that coming into it as well it's a little bit heavier than the old bike and we knew that as well so those are three things that we kind of expected and we really confirmed on this trip there are a few things that we learned that we really didn't expect uh like the electronics package on the bike pretty flexible and very usable I think makes the bike a lot more approachable for more novice level riders or intermediate level Riders also I found that the the 1190 they really increased the steering lock over what the 990 had and it made it just absolutely Pleasant to turn around on a forest service road compared to the older bike it saves you from getting off the bike and having to push it backward uh which was a really nice thing uh the suspension on the new bike actually is it's a significant upgrade from what we've got on the 990 uh especially when you consider how much heavier the bike is and lastly the looks they really grew on us I it's it's not a bad looking bike [Music] one great convenience feature on this bike is the adjustable compression on the left fork leg and the adjustable rebound on the right fork leg you can really fine-tune your forks without ever leaving the saddle the electronics package on this KTM 1190 is one of the things that really sets it apart from its predecessor you've got 14 different screens that you can access right here and you control all of this with the little four button pod on The Handlebar usually what people are going to be doing is when they get onto the bike they're going to press the down button one time that puts you into your drive mode selector from here you get into sport Street rain or off-road modes these are the modes that change how much power the bike's putting down and how the traction control is working at first on the 1190 I thought that there wasn't enough difference in the throttle turn between some of the different riding modes but after being on this bike for a few days I really think they nailed it we were in sport mode here which is the full 148 horsepower traction control off and uh ABS in off-road mode the modulation on the The Ride by wire throttle is incredible you always can find the right place you can stay in the same gear longer you're almost never in the wrong gear where in the older bike the 990 the power is more peaky uh it's a little trickier to get the throttle just right it's a lot easier to lose the back end so the bike's much more stable predictable and it really goes in a straight line I think better than the old bike so this bike is designed to compete with the water cool GS Yamaha tene uh the Triumph 1200 Explorer and I think out of those four bikes this is the most capable off-road bike I think that the BMW would be the close second but they've really positioned the KTM brand to excel in the dirt and I think they really delivered on this bike for the off-road category in terms of a Touring bike I think that some of the Creature Comforts on the BMW and some of the other things will will win over some guys but uh pure dirt experience I think in the 1200 class I think this bike is on top what do you think I totally agree I think that if there's no luggage on the bike if you're not thinking about touring with it if you purely just want to get in the dirt and race I think that a 990 the the full height a 990r I think it still gets around a little bit better on the dirt just the the chassis feels a little tighter uh a little bit more crisp uh but everywhere else the the big bike just seems a lot easier and a lot more comfortable and a lot more capable on the pavement the thing is incredible Ian says it sounds like a trophy truck I think that is the perfect way to explain it when you get on you can just feel this horsepower you've never felt on an adventure bike the handling on the pavement compared to some of the other big adventure bikes I think is a little bit hurt with the 21in front wheel if you're more of an aggressive pavement Rider the r model might not be the one to look at so despite having 150 horsepower 50 more horsepower than the old bike or something in that range whose fuel light came on first the 990 ran out first that's been one of my biggest complaints about the 990 over the years I'm really happy this bike's got better fueld range than the old bike because the longer your fuel range the safer you are if you've been thinking about getting the KTM 1190 you won't be disappointed more power great handling phenomenal brakes carries the weight well and it's just a ton of fun to ride Offroad yeah it's a big fast motorcycle what's not to love

        "transcript": "[Music] hi it's December 28th 2011 I'm Peter Martinson and this is your weather report as we wrap up 2011 we find ourselves in the quiet before the storm both politically and geomagnetically now if you recall the past several weather reports the past couple of weeks have been very anomalous on the sun on the one hand there have been a lot of coronal mass injections almost every day there are coronal mass injections while at the same time x-ray output from the sun has been uh extremely low there have been almost no real uh solar flares over the past couple of weeks even though there have been a lot of sunspots on the sun in fact we might be at Sunspot maximum even though x-ray output is very low over the past couple of days though things have begun to pick up on Christmas Eve a formerly quiet Sunspot in the southern hemisphere of the sun began shooting out mclass x-ray flares while a sunspot group in the northern hemisphere just rotating out of sight left us with a long flare which hit us with a proton radiation storm then two filamentary eruptions occurred in the northern hemisphere both of which Unleashed coronal mass ejections that now appear to be headed directly towards the Earth these two are the first potential head-on collision threats we've faced based all year remember the last major impact of a coronal mass ejection was at the end of October which hit and caused a very sharp geomagnetic storm several days before the now Infamous Halloween nor Easter snowstorm now does this mean that we're set for yet one more so-called billion dooll disaster before we even exit 2011 it's not totally clear what you see here is a forecast Track by the garded space weather laboratory at Nasa where what's portrayed is the coronal mass ejection leaving the Sun and headed straight for the Earth this little yellow dot indeed it's headed straight for us but it may pass a little bit high and possibly only graze the northern hemisphere of our magnetic field so it may or may not generate a large geomagnetic storm but it's important to be aware that as this coronal mass injection is headed towards the Earth right now a very large unst storm system is forming inside the Gulf of Alaska now what coronal mass ejections and the subsequent geomagnetic storms tend to do is not just not only send the northern lights down into the lower latitudes so we can see them down in Michigan and Arkansas but they also tend to intensify low pressure systems in the Gulf of Alaska to create large storms that then get sent down into the lower 48 states so as we exit 2011 we may indeed be inside of the Calm before the storm thank you I'll see you next year"

        "transcript": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] ladies and gentlemen in this red gamer.com video we're going to be discussing resolutions again however this time it's actually slightly more amusing the resolution of Dragon Age Inquisition has now been officially unveiled by EA so it's confirmed that 1080p will be the resolution for the PlayStation 4 and 9 100 p is on the Xbox One and then electronic art stated via a tweet we maximize the current potential of each platform now the reason that you can't make stuff like this up and people on the internet are becoming in obscenely amused by this is Assassin's Creed unity's tweet um regarding the resolution was actually retweeted by Phil Spencer then shua yida from of course PlayStation retweeted the fact that it's going to be 1080p on the PlayStation 4 now tons of users have basically taken to Twitter and are immediately pointing this confirmation from Electronic Arts to Ubisoft and saying see Ubisoft this is how it's done effectively you've got this you've managed to turn this home resolution debacle into electronic art somehow one up in Ubisoft and while that might not sound like a huge deal it's quite bloody amusing if I'm totally blunt the reason I find this so amusing is people are actually canceling their pre-orders of Assassin's Creed Unity now the fact of the matter is you might go ahead and say well what the hell people are counceling over the resolution but they're not celing it so much over the resolution or frame rate but the fact that Ubisoft just can't seem to make their mind up regarding the message Mage um now you've got this you've got this situation where Unity is going to be released at least in the United Kingdom within a one week window of Dragon Age and so players in this one tweet players are actually rallying behind Electronic Arts people are counseling pre-orders and saying no Dragon Age Inquisition is getting my cash because of this and I the reason I find this all so amazing is because well it's just quite funny this whole situation is just blown up so much out of hand and the reason I love it the the this whole thing just comes down to the fact that well Ubisoft weren't clear if they'd have just been clear from the beginning I don't think any of this situation would happened but now they've just effectively gotten slapped over Twitter and of course websites like Reddit neoa you know the usual suspects by now are basically relishing in their anguish so so anyway guys once again this isn't the biggest piece of news I'm only showing this primarily because of the amusement factor it's pretty awesome and what I'm going to go ahead and do is link the neoa Fred uh in the video description so you can go ahead and check it out if you so desire but with all of that said hopefully you've enjoyed the video I'll see you soon take care and bye for now [Music]"

        "transcript": "[Music] what's good it's DJ T from djbooth.net I'm here with the good people at aai they're introducing the advanced keyboard series I'm here with Jennifer from aai she's going to walk us through some dope dope new stuff from a car all right Jenifer take it away all right thanks a lot so yeah this is a the Kai's new Advanced keyboard and uh it's a it's a great new product that's about to hit the the stores here in a couple of weeks and um what it is it's a smart controller so you've got a a keyboard here it can act as a midi controller um and control you know any external gear or Doss software anything you want um but the uh the thing the the keyboard really comes alive when you use it with the virtual instrument player software called VIP so VIP is uh a is a host controller sort of like a dah and the thing about VIP is that it allows you it's the first sort of solution here that allows you to take any plug-in that you have on your system from any manufacturer and uh it'll load it all into here at one time and you can see I've got different plugins from Native Instruments um air music text son box um you can have stuff from artoria omnisphere you know anything anything that you've got on your system and uh once you hit okay it's going to pull all the different patches and presets that you have from all those different plugins into the VIP software and now you can get in here and you can start uh selecting your sounds and playing them and what I'm going to show I'm going to show you a couple things on the the software side but actually you can do all of this stuff from the keyboard itself so you notice the keyboard's got this great 4.2 in color display here and uh and you can get so you really feel like you're right in on the keyboard playing it and uh you see you can just step through [Music] Pion now I was just loading up a bunch of different Patches from uh ni's massive but the thing about VIP is that you can go beyond that now and say you know what I just want to uh find a lead sound that's um you know maybe a little bit dirty and kind of analog sounding and now it's going to pull up all of those uh dirty analog lead patches that you have again across any plugin that you've got and brings it right down here and you can start playing them so this is something from Loom [Music] [Music] I got something from [Music] massive and that's great because you know it's so easy to find your patches it takes just much faster than the old way of doing things then once you've got your your patch selected now you can of course the next thing you want to do is kind of mess around with it so what you do is you go into control mode and control mode now takes all of the sound par parameters that are associated with these vsts and it assigns them to these physical controllers on the on the hardware so [Music] here [Music] see you can just completely manipulate the sound here you know in real time as you go so um you've got four Banks of knobs to work with you've got four Banks of buttons to work with and four Banks of NPC pads that you can uh play around with um the other cool thing about this software is we've got a a Mode called multi mode and multim mode allows you to layer up to eight different uh patches you know again from any plugin um all together at once so I've got this in here I can take this patch here from I got a patch from from massive now I'm going to add a patch from [Music] Loom just by clicking and dragging that thing over there I've got now a totally big sound here and I can go in and I can pan these things again you can do anything directly on the keyboard [Music] now your pads can [Music] mute solo change the [Music] volume so you can do mixing kind of stuff you can you could lay beats down here and then maybe have piano up here and a lead up here I mean it's just totally up to musician and producer how they want to you know lay things out um for people that are playing live I there's a set list mode where you can all you know the favorite patches that you're using or or select patches that using for like your first set or your second set you can just lay these out in a list just by clicking and dragging and and then um again you could do that here and then you just step through these patches again right through the [Music] keyboard now you may have noticed right there I was holding one patch go back to it just going to hold that note and now I'm going to switch you notice it's still holding that previous [Music] sound and S and you can load [Music] up this is very musical you can switch and change patches and nothing ever glitches or pops you know it's just it's just super super musical um so VIP uh it runs as a as a standalone piece of software but you can also load it up inside a dah like uh NPC or um Mableton life or Protools or you know whatever you're working with and um you can do all the the same things you know inside a dah um and that's it it's just this is just a just a great product really you got to check it out"

        "transcript": "[Music] wow the best thing about being up high is the views you get a completely different outlook of things among the trees yes i'm in a tree house and what a great place to be hang on what's happening sorry but uh i think you're actually in my tree house so if you don't mind we need to get on and make this wonderful creation it may not be a life-sized tree house but this is brilliant for making up stories or just playing to make it you'll need a box like this one it's best to use a square one because it will be easier to make the roof you'll see later so if you're ready let's start now where did he go on one side of the box draw the door and windows of your house [Music] on the other sides you only need to draw windows [Music] when you're finished cut out the shapes ask an adult to help you with all the cutting today leave one side of the door uncut so you can open and close it to make the roof place the box on the thick cardboard sheet and trace the outline but as you need a bigger rectangle leave a little more space on each side and twice the amount on the top and bottom then draw the rectangle's outer line like this when you finish cut out the shape and divide it in half you'll have two sheets like this then just tape the roof on one side now fold the roof like this and place it on the other sheet draw on the inside and then trace a line onto the base you'll make a triangle you'll have to cut out two that are the same take the triangles to the edges of the roof like this one on each side now your house has a roof there we go ding dong so this now looks like a proper house like one you might find where you live but the exciting thing about this house is it's going to be up in the trees let's carry on with the make place the base of your house on a thick piece of cardboard and mark an edge with a ruler on each side then draw a square around it cut off the extra bits on the sides and you'll end up with a square this will be the supporting stand for the tree house now place it on another bigger sheet of cardboard and draw the ground add curvy edges like this it's like a big flower then cut it out along the lines you've drawn now we have the ground which will be covered with grass but we'll do that a bit later on to make the tree get a cardboard roll and tape it up securely make sure it's really strong now get the stand that you cut out earlier and tape it onto the tube like this and lastly glue the house on the base in the middle when the roof is on it's almost a complete house it's looking great but there's still something that we need to do and if you need a clue mix yourself some art attack paste which is half water and half glue and strips of newspaper and some kitchen towel let's continue to make the grass stick on strips of kitchen towel and wrinkle it up with a brush the cardboard tube will be the tree trunk so you need to cover this as well with twisted strips of paper and more paste make the shapes of the branches that will hold up the house add strips of newspaper with your pace to the platform you need to glue thoroughly from the top to bottom for the roof glue both the outside and inside bits the roof should be made really strong so cover it as thickly as you can we don't want it to blow off to make the rope ladder cut two pieces of string of the same length that will reach from the platform down to the grass set them side by side on a plastic sheet and glue toothpicks one by one for the steps like these one step at a time wow i love this rope ladder although it may be a bit small for my feet you could use other things like little tweaks maybe if you don't have any toothpicks or even cut out cardboard strips just use whatever materials you have to hand but now it's time to start painting time to start drawing the details on the door and the windows and draw the skirting board [Music] then draw lines for the roof now we'll give it some color this house will be sky blue but you can choose your favorite color [Music] paint the base green because that's the color of grass of course and then for the trunk use brown paint the platform the same color to match up with the tree trunk the doors and the windows we're using orange for the skirting board and we'll also paint some of the stripes on the roof in the same color combine it with some bright colors and your house will look fantastic use a bright color for the inside floor of your house the steps can also be brown as if they were supposed to be made of wood this might be a bit fiddly to paint so i recommend you put down some plastic or newspaper first with a dry brush paint little yellow highlights on the grass so it looks as if the sun is shining do the same on the trunk and so the wood looks real painting the lines with a moist brush and a lighter shade of brown lastly glue on the rope ladder your stairway into the clouds the tree house is ready as a finishing touch we've used a black felt tip pen on all the lines to make it look really neat now click left or right for more great shows or subscribe to keep up to date with the latest disney junior youtube clips"

        "transcript": "hi it's subtle our and you are now watching violin launch TV where you learn to improve your violin and viola playing with a joy and in this episode I'm going to answer a question from Boone and he writes their missus lava tower I watched the video of yours about bowing straight a couple of days ago and I would like to consult your advice about playing violin the most frustrating problem that I don't know how to deal with is although I have played been playing violins for three years I've never felt comfortable when holding my violin I have a long neck and a thin body and according to Maya banks violin book which is the only one I come self besides my teacher I suppose that my long neck is the obstacle also in the book the author said I should find solution in raising the chin rest instead of trying higher shoulder rests however raising to rest seems impossible because all the finest shop I visited it refused to do that and she's just me to hire my shoulder rest and they had no idea about raising the chin rest my teacher thinks that I could use a shower towel of a handkerchief but they just ease the problem rather than solving it completely I think that the problem is its I think it's my major problem cause in many other minor effects when I play my right shoulder holding the bow just keeps rising up making me feel tired of the shoulder for now I'm trying to balance my way of playing and I think that you could suggest me some solutions let's hope so and for laughs I'm kind of curious about how can some violence like it's a theremin or in Jascha Heifetz hold the violin without children even more I fit violin seem to point up a small angle I just want to feel comfortable and I can't play it with joy just like they did in their videos I would be very appreciated if you could help thank you and Happy New Year best wishes boom from Vietnam well boom good question a lot of people struggle with it certainly if they are too or if they have a long neck or both what you heard and financial is sorry to say that but it's not true probably they just say that because most common shopper vests you can easily adjust in Heights but a chin rest is just one wooden thing that you can pick one out but after that it's not adjustable in height so I think they are speaking from the shoulder rest and shinra's that are on the market and not from an economical perspective because I see also in lots of orchestras strange constructions with shoulder rest with extra pieces and pieces of foam and stuff and it only makes your vine and heavier and it doesn't make it more comfortable well concerning your violin holes I would just follow your teacher because everybody wants to find in a slightly different way and there are different ways to learn it so if you have regular lessons with your teacher then just follow his or her system I would say what helped me a lot is that I don't want a filing up like this anymore but that I keep it a little bit more to the front and a little bit more like this that I have the feeling that my fingers I can hang on the violin like this and it's a very relaxed tool because you don't have to put it up but which is very yeah your you have to do a lot with your muscles then and you see lots of people playing without your wrists also in that way by the way I play with a short rest not a very high one but I'm planning to interview someone who teaches people to play with her children so that's in another video because I think playing with shield rest myself I am NOT a person to explain someone else to play without perfect eye I hope you understand that but as opposed to the chin rest and the height what you can what the problem is is if you make your shoulders higher and higher the first thing that happens is that the fining goes up and that's not what we want because if violin is higher then your bow arm must be higher too and that's why you have to raise your right shoulder to get to the violin that it's too high and then you get pain in your shoulder and it gets tired and well tired is least of your problems you can get some injury from it too so don't make your shoulder rest higher and higher and higher instead of that you can put some something if you make these screws loose you can put something here in between the violin and chin rest or you can make it just a little bit higher you can do that with for example some quark I think it's gold from a wine bottle and so you can make your own chin rest a little bit higher and searching the internet for higher chin rest and just order the chin rest that you have but then in a higher version because if you make your chin rest higher then you have here more space filled up and at the same time your violin will be in the same position so I think you definitely need to look for chin rest if you haven't found higher chin rest or they are too expensive then maybe you can ask someone who is handy with wood carving to create a chin rest for you so you can have it made perhaps I hope this will help you I've seen several people with the same problem and then the only solution is actually maybe some adjustments in your violin holes but definitely and another chin rest or at least a higher chin rest I hope this helps well do you like this video then please like it and share it with your friends if you'd like to

        "transcript": "hello everybody you know it's almost Cinco Deo and I was thinking we need to have another little recipe for that occasion so today I'm making a nice ttio salsa with chili de Aro and it's nice and spicy so if you like it hot I think you're going to like this one I've got a bunch of Mexican recipes for you for Cinco Deo so I'm going to leave a link in the description for my Mexican food recipe playlist and you can check that out so anyway I'm rock and Robin and I'm going to show you how to make this salsa right after [Music] this so let me go over the ingredients with you and we can get started so here's our tomatillos I've got about a pound here and they have this little paper like covering over them and we're going to be removing that and we're going to go ahead and give them a nice rinse because they have a little sticky residue on them so that's what we're going to do with that and then here's our chili de arbo uh peppers and these are dried and we're going to roast those a little bit they come in a package you can get them in the um section of your grocery store for the Mexican food and we're going to need some garlic I'm using fresh garlic here and I'm leaving the paper skins on these so that when we roast them I don't want that garlic to burn and that's going to help protect it all right we'll need a little bit of salt some fresh lime juice a little bit of sugar now this is optional if you don't want to add that but just a little touch of that and then we'll also finish with some cilantro so now what we're going to do is roast our Tas so that we get a nice flavor into them and I'm going to go ahead and cut these in half uh just so I have more surface area to uh cook under the broiler we're going to put these in our Broiler about 4 in from the heating element and we're going to roast them away for just about maybe four or 5 minutes we're going to keep a close eye on them though once we get all those cut then we're going to also place our garlic on the pan to roast as well well so this is going to go in the [Music] oven all right guys you've been in here about 10 minutes now and this is what we're looking for you see all that nice charring that's going on that's our flavor and there's quite a few juices released here and we're going to put all of that into our salsa so I'm let Set this aside to cool so like I said I'm going to take about half of our uh chili they are both chilies and you can use more or less depending on how hot you want it to be and some of them have little stems on them the ends these are pretty good but occasionally you'll find one and you want to just take that off so I have my pan here over medium low heat and I'm just going to place my chilies right on top you want to be careful here that because these can burn very quickly so we're just going to keep a close eye on them and I'll keep tossing them over all right these are looking good I think it's time to place them in our hot water so I'm going to turn off the heat and do that so in they go we'll go ahead and let those soak for a good 10 [Music] minutes and you're going to want to push them down into the water so they get to get in there all right guys we are ready to put this thing together our um chili have been soaking now and they're ready to go all right so I'm going to place the chilies into the blender they're a little bit softened up and we're just putting the the peppers in there not the juice okay cuz we don't want this to be a real thin salsa this is supposed to be chunky and you know a little bit thick place the uh tomatillos in there and the juice so we want to get that juice in there too it's a lot of good flavor now here's where I like to add just a little pinch of maybe you know less than a/4 of a teaspoon or maybe about a/4 teaspoon of sugar just a little bit to sweeten it up and our salt I'm just going to drop some in there like that it's probably about a teaspoon or so and that you can just adjust you know to your liking next goes our garlic here you can see it's roasted leaving that paper on really protected it from burning it's nice and golden and so we're going to add that to our salsa [Music] now and then I'm I'm just going to take a little bit of lime juice not too much maybe you know maybe a half a teaspoon just for a little bit of you know citrusy flavor in there all right and now we're just going to blend this up and we want to blend it up by pulsing because we don't want to just purify this and make it real liquidy we want it slightly chunky now that I've got most of my salsa Blended up the way I want it I'm going to add some little bit of [Music] cilantro here I'm going to add that in now if you need to adjust your sauce like mine is very very thick right now if you need to thin it out you want to add a little bit of your water that you were soaking your peppers in for more flavor I'm going to add about a tablespoon of water to this all right guys let me show you what this looks like and again you can make it thinner if you like it thinner but um I think it looks pretty good the way it is look at this look at that this goes really fantastic on top tacos and burritos TOA anything you want and you could even have it with just chips if you want look at that beautiful Rich sauce spicy probably a little more powerful than I can handle but I'll I'll give it a shot o here we go M that is good A little powerful though guys you see me but it's got a really nice flavor very good roasted flavor in there from roasting our totillo and our garlic you're going to love this guys thanks for watching if you like this video please share it check out my um link for all the Mexican recipes for Cinco de Mayo make some of those add some of this sauce to it you're going to love it all right guys thanks for watching don't forget to subscribe if you haven't and leave me a comment we'll see you next [Music] time"

        "transcript": "hello and welcome to bro Jule today we have the dragon killer cart reloaded the mud adds a rideable card that lets you tether your horse and carry any followers along with you on your journey we covered the mud quite a while back but we thought we'd share some of the updates with you since its original release it's expanded into more of a portable home - but we'll cover that later in the video you can find the cart at the Whiterun stables and any interaction with the cart is done through a dialog menu that opens when you activate it from the menu you have a bunch of self explanatory options so whenever I mention a feature you can just assume you can find it in the menu to attach your horse to the cart you need to craft a harness set a tanning rack then place it in your horses inventory and then select the tether option in the menu then you can hop on board and ride around which is way easier and smoother to control compared to its initial release you can also change the speed from the menu to go a little faster but obviously if you got too fast to make a sharp turn the cart will tip over so find the right speed for you and then stick with it your followers can also join you by casting two spells on them to make them hop on board and you'll also need the ultimate follower overall for it to work you also have the option of three different car models one with skulls and a soft top one designed for a traveling merchant and the final which is a mixture of the two the author wanted players to have the option to be continually on the go but players still need to head into cities to sometimes use their facilities but to limit that the author has added a bunch of different craftable items so you can set up your own camp with your own facilities setting up the items is easy just drop them on the floor and then activate them to set them in place the items range from full crafting stations to tents candles and more so you can stop anywhere on the road tie up your cart and call it a night before getting up early for a morning alchemy session since its release a few months ago the author is fixed and expanded enough to warrant a second try through of the mud and we think a lot of you who tried it before will be pleasantly surprised with the new outcome and that's the end of today's spotlight as always remember to leave an endorsement if you enjoy off as mud leave your suggestions down below for future spotlights and thanks for watching [Music]"

        "transcript": "hey ravelers I'm roxs and feminity has a question she wants to know how exactly do you knit and pearl backwards and what is the use of knowing well there are a couple of reasons that Knitters might knit backwards and um let's define what backwards is it's really mirror knitting which instead of knitting from the left needle to the right needle you're knitting stitches from the right needle to the left needle some left-handed knits are taught to knit this way by right-handed knits who assume that uh left-handed people need to do um everything in Reverse this isn't true but once you've learned how to knit in a in a particular way any of you will realize it's difficult to learn a completely new and different way of knitting and since there's no reason why they can't knit in knit mirror then they continue to do so another reason that uh someone might choose to knit backwards or mirror is if they detest pearling for long stretches so if you're knitting in stock AET um rather than pearling flipping your work and pearling back you can keep the right side facing and you knit the stitches from the right needle to the left needle um so that's another reason why why uh somebody might choose to do that the reason I sometimes choose to uh to to do mirror knitting is if I'm knitting very short rows and that's what I'm going to show today so let's knit a bobble so you can see uh why I would use backwards knitting first thing you have to do when you knit a bobble is you need to increase quite a few stitches so I'm going to make five stitches out of this one going to do it by knitting into the front then the back and then the front and losing my anchor and then back and then end with knitting it in the front now normally what you would have to do is you would have to flip the work and then you would have to um Purl back across these five stitches and then you would flip the work again and then you would knit across them and then you'd flip it again a pearl across you do this several times back and forth back and forth and if you have a number of bobles across the row it gets to be a big pain in the rear so what can be uh more efficient is to knit across those stitches backwards so you enter the Stitch through the center as you would normally but you're you're pushing the left needle through the stitch on the right needle so it goes to the center pushing against the back Loop and then you wrap the yarn around that left needle counterclockwise just like you would if you were uh wrapping it around the right needle and doing normal forward knitting and then you come off the Stitch so you go through wrap counterclockwise pull that Loop through and take it off the needle so I've got to do three more of these one I I anchor my right needle so it's a little awkward when I have a camera in between me and my knitting oh that one is there we go okay so I've knit those backwards and now I'm going to knit them normally again so one two 2 3 4 5 um if you're a continental Knitter uh and I can't I can knit Continental I cannot knit Continental backwards but I'm just going to show you what you'd have to do normally you have the yarn in your left hand like this when you enter the Stitch this yarn has to come around counterclockwise so you can't pick the yarn because the the needle you'd be picking with is over here so instead you have to bring uh you have to wrap the yarn around the needle and because of the way I tension the yarn and knit Continental I just I just can't do it so the but the yarn has to come around this way if you were to switch the yarn to the other hand so that you were mirroring the way that you were tensioning the yarn again the Y because the yarn has to come around counterclockwise you need to it would be hard to pick because the the yarn needs to be held kind of down in order for you to to bring the loop through um if you are a uh combined nitter though so that your pearls always end up mounting the stitches in the opposite direction you could pick this way and that will leave the stitches mounted the way that you're used to with the right leg in the back and the left leg in front and that's how you knit backwards"
