        "transcript": "hello YouTube my name is cisc and I'm here today to teach you how to own scrubs at Super Street Fighter 4 so let's just get into the game real quick Xbox Live battle blah blah blah okay ranked match create match initially I don't know if you can see that I would have one round at 30 seconds um [\u00a0__\u00a0] camera stay [\u00a0__\u00a0] put with you wow man okay that'll do that'll do uh and you set region to any this this works because if you get an American in your room uh you can lag and the lag will help you win so yeah but don't set the rounds to one set it to five this works because if your opponent somehow beats you in the first round you've still got two more you've got two or three more chances to still win so uh and also it'll come into play later into the game if something should happen which you'll probably see if it does so now we just wait for a victim this is guaranteed Battle Points by the way you will win lots of points by doing this um you may get bad reputation though I've got about 80% of voids at the moment but that's cuz everyone's a [\u00a0__\u00a0] [\u00a0__\u00a0] scrub so we found somebody we're going into the game now one thing you want to do you see the timer in the bottom right hand corner 26 seconds left we're going to use all of those seconds this psyches out the opponent and they don't know you know they're like why is it taking so long but I mean you know you're thinking about which character to choose you can't even see their character you don't need to see their character it's all Mind Games you know what I mean so at this point they're thinking [\u00a0__\u00a0] who's he going to choose I'm not ready for this uh and you wait wait wait 4 seconds left 3 2 one bam you chose Ken um and again we've got 10 seconds to choose a map so deliberately you just sort of go on every map thinking about which one to choose but I mean it doesn't really matter you just it's cying at your opponent again so it's chosen jungle for us now it looks like we've got a Vega player and the good thing about this is Vega can lose his core if you hit H him enough so that's what we're going to want to get that claw off him so all right he's cheating or whatever so you start there we go now this guy's a [\u00a0__\u00a0] scrub so if we just yeah that's see he gets hit by that all whatever you see that [\u00a0__\u00a0] oh you [\u00a0__\u00a0] scrub Noob [\u00a0__\u00a0] 4 seconds left 3 seconds left one nil and we win the first round just like that this guy's a [\u00a0__\u00a0] scrub right oh I don't know what he's doing but he's cheating well that's just [\u00a0__\u00a0] [\u00a0__\u00a0] oh I'm going to I'm going to own this scrub in the next round just to watch look how much damage that [\u00a0__\u00a0] kick did and now at this point he's won two rounds right and we've only won one so we're going to let this next round play out until about 15 seconds in right and then we're going to make a decision now this guy's playing like a scrub this is called Turtle scrubbing where you just block my attacks and then counter with an attack of your own it's an advanced it's an advanced form of nuber now we can't win this round now so what we're going to do you go on to the Xbox menu press y for dashboard and choose yes uh and that means that the opponent won't get any points for that you know for being scrub so effectively we've just owned him I mean we don't get any points I think we lose some points for doing that but it's worth it because I mean you saw how that guy was playing uh so it's like a win-win situation either we win points or the opponent doesn't win any points so we're either rewarded for excellent play or the opponent is not rewarded for scrubby play and I think that that's all you need to know really and if you do that on every game you will become one of the best players in super Street F 4 and you will be immune to all forms of scribber so that concludes my tutorial I hope you learned something I've just realized the camera is not exactly facing the TV in the right angle but that's okay and good luck"

that crap whatever happened to that those games were good and it makes me feel sad and slightly disappointed that to J's generation of Gamers the kids are growing up now grow up on PlayStation and Nintendo 64 and all that crap they're not getting exposed to the classic gaming the old games back with Graphics didn't matter it was just the story and the game play this irit this irritates me now I was thinking earlier yeah people are going to probably get mad at me for this cuz well most people nowadays are more about the graphics oh wow this game looks so real this game looks so cool this game you can make your own town and all [\u00a0__\u00a0] games are getting stupid I'm not going to like like The Sims I'm sorry anyone out there who likes the Sims I think is absolutely [\u00a0__\u00a0] why have a game based on real life when you can just go live real life I get it's just a simulation but still it's it's stupid to me and G game stories are like come on they're getting horrible now game play is getting horrible I mean controls nowadays absolutely are starting to suck I mean I've I have a Wii I have a PlayStation 3 I have PlayStation 2 I have all that I have all the new stuff and I still play the old stuff more often I play the new stuff I love the old stuff this is just my personal opinion but it's sad what's happening to kids now they don't know old games I mean I was talking to one of my friends the other day who's like 13 I'm 17 it surprised me that just 3 years they didn't know what an NES or S and S were they didn't know about the games th this this made me really sad I mean I love that the Way's putting old games on their uh virtual console that that makes me so happy but it's not enough like admittingly I do like some of the newer games older better than the older games but many many more of the older games were better they're trying to make stuff either too complicated or just trying to appeal to the eyes now like what's a good example castania the old Castlevania games rocked the one for the uh Playstation that one was good but the ones for the DS I mean come on no I mean yeah they are good but I can't remember which one it's like I think it's the first one came with the DS you have to they have use a stylist to draw stuff if you don't draw fast enough or great enough you don't get it right I mean I like the fact that DS is touchcreen I like the fact that has a stylist and all that but you can't incorporate that into every game or incorporate that too much into games like Mega Man Star Force the first one you had to use this the stylus the touchcreen for almost everything and it bugged the crap out of me I I never actually finished the game because of that Mega Man Star Force 2 they fixed that problem yeah I like that one it's better they they made it better Wii the Wii is fine the Wii is the graphics aren't the best but I really don't give a crap the games are still good not all the games but the games are still good brawl is like one of the best ones but I love fighting games like that anyways the Re remote I mean come on that that hardly ever always registers where you where you're pointing it makes me mad PlayStation 3 it's mostly a very expensive Blu-ray player I'm sorry I me it has good games I myself have Infamous and resistance and Street Fighter but it's it's mostly just to download games on that I'm sorry Xbox 360 I honestly don't have opinion on that I don't know why I just I don't but what I find myself playing more often than anything the old Game Boy Game Boy Color SNES Sega Sega Dreamcast all these old G all these old systems in my opinion are better the newer ones I mean I don't know about the Atari cuz I never played any Atari system but I still find those old systems are better and the the Sega Dreamcast I I found was the best dis system and it makes me sad that that never really went far makes me happy that Sega is coming out with a new console but still old systems man what is happening to today's youth they don't know about the old games like Earthbound Breath of Fire it's that they only know about games that they get remade and Earthbound has been remade I think once Earthbound zero once which in my opinion Earthbound Z wasn't wasn't that great they only know about games if they get remade or if they hear about them from someone else on the internet this is not how it should be they should already know about these old games these great games these games where you can not cheat on unless you were like some kind of [\u00a0__\u00a0] genius cuz back then you have the internet old game systems are the best in my opinion my personal favorite SNES favorite games bre my bre part series and Mega Man series I love playing Final Fantasy but Final Fantasy is out on Nintendo first and well I guess that's all I have to say I'd like to know what you guys think about it about old games versus new games today's gaming generation what's your opinion post a comment below or post a video comment I don't think many of you going to watch this but still I'd like to know what you think see you guys next time freak out"

        "transcript": "hi it's Yandel from Queens of wigs.com and I am rocking I know it's a lot of hair calm down I'm rocking kinky straight um 16 in Long in color 99j um and I got this texture because I'm the type of person that usually I'm obsessed with Brazilian here I usually wear Brazilian virgin straight or Brazilian deep wave I love love Brazilian but I was trying something different I'm usually a girl that gets 1B or natural black but I love this red I had it last summer if you look at some of my videos you would see in a regular cap with a bang and it was in the Yaki straight but I'm like you know what try something different so I have on a full lace no glue which I'm obsessed with the glueless because you don't have to glue it down to your head you're not tied down when you come home in the afternoon you can um take it off you will be free you could take a break from the wig and let your real hair breathe and get to your scalp when you need to this is a freestyle parting throughout the entire cap it's 120 density I know it looks like a lot more but you got to keep the hair texture in mind this was custom made for me because of the color um and it's a full lace glueless cap not regular so as you can see I'm parting it wherever I want so it's freestyle I'm not making that up and I wouldn't um I wouldn't advise for this someone to wear this if you are someone who doesn't like being hot this is not a summer wig I love I can deal with heat I'm a summer baby but I'll wear a long hair down to my butt in the summer it doesn't bother me and you still can put this up too but for somebody who like gets hot and bothered and likes to wear their hair short or light in the summer this is definitely this texture kinky straight is definitely in my opinion something to wear in the fall and the winter because it's so warm but it's so comfortable like I don't think you guys understand when you touch it it's so soft know your hands are not going to get Cuts or you know get stuck in it it's really soft and feels really nice to the touch if you look closely in there I don't know if you can see it looks like my roots are darker I did that by taking um a mascara brush mascara and I just darkened The Roots a little bit to give it a more bit of a natural color I didn't do that that all over because that's just for that part when I want my roots to look darker but hey if I don't want my roots to look dark then I just parted someplace else um and I only had black mascara at home or I could only find my black mascara I couldn't find my dark brown but I think for this color dark brown would be a bit more natural and not as dramatic as the black if you wanted to try that trick this can can be pulled up um the trick I wish I brought my bobby pins out here um the trick is you're going to tuck some here to the side and take a bobby pin and put it right back there and you're going to do the same thing to this this side you're going to tuck some ha underneath and put the bobby pin to secure that in place and then you can pull the hair up however you want I'll show you pictures of my hair pulled up um at the end if you have questions like I said this is a glueless cap um I'll take off the cap quickly I don't want to take up too much of your time I know you guys are busy okay so this is a full lace clap you got a little bit of lace up here but you got the stretch lace in between because it's glueless you have to have the stretch lace and you have to have the adjustable straps at the back that's why I love it because this type of cap when you put it on I don't even have the adjustable straps fastened right now but when you put it on it just snugs to your scalp so you're secure without bobby pins or whatever I'm feeling this kinky straight texture it go it brings me back to my natural Roots no it's not this long it's probably about this long but I feel free in this I feel like Shaka Kan I mean I can do so much different things with it I can um straighten her out of course if I wanted to go for a more Yaky texture I could straighten her out with flatten iron I can roller set her I can twist flat twist set her I can do some natural styles on her some different things she's still very versatile but she looks close to my real here texture she looks let's be real I mean some people love the silky straight I'm not a fan of silky straight I've always been a Yaky girl but some people love silky straight some people love yakie whatever but this is the closest thing to my real hair texture and I'm not afraid to be bold and wear my real hair texture um why not in a longer length and this hair is much more manageable than my real hair would be so um if you have any questions you know ask a question below I will I promise I know I've been away for a while I promise I will be doing videos at least once a month as a matter of fact I know I'm doing another video tomorrow with this pinned up and I'm going to be on the track telling you guys how your hair should not keep you back from being healthy I've been so inspired and motivated by the Olympics Gabby Michael Phelps they've been achieving their goals it's time for me to hit the track and be healthy not to lose weight but to stay in shape come on ladies we got to do it don't let your hair keep you back but that's it for now if you have any questions comments concerns whatever feel free to comment below or message me or visit my site www. queenof legs.com have a beautiful day people I will talk to you later bye-bye"

        "transcript": "hello my dear listeners uh today I'm just sorting my uh food at home and this is a part of my preparation and I decide to make a video about so I have lots of um uh weeds from Russian store and to be honest some of them like this one I don't even know the English name of it so if you know uh you can maybe have write it in the comments I you know that I really like the uh back weed so it's uh 289 for a kilogram you have some of them comes in the uh like this air been sucked out first I start I went really hard and I was buying lots of this uh rice was really cheap and then I figured out that it's not really uh good for health and I was thinking you know some uh cost effective food that will be sustaining because you not um only if your diet will become more poor and you have to live after your stash you have to nourish your body even uh back WID will be maybe compared to Rice uh 50 uh to 60% more expensive in in area where I leave I think this is a much better food and will nourish your body so at the end it's not the price by kilogram but how it will be nourishing your body and I also bought the seeds like this it's the seeds it can be just add to uh some food I I just buy big bag of it and I have sesame seeds um yeah this one this one I'm almost out but I also have 10 kg of them um I'm not really I I was buying a lot a little bit of the conserves I think it's not the cost efficient way in my opinion I have a few conserves there they are not really healthy and it's much it's really better to buy uh something like this that's the that's the protein and I also buy some dry fruits um and I have here this is oil since I like to cook on oil uh this is the maple syrup I have case I bought the case uh paid only uh like 50 $53 for8 so it's uh 650 for can of maple syrup that was really good buy uh this season for wire I'm this is actually wire from um my Cottage and in Canada I'm thinking the storing wire because I have a Creeks here in the forest in the walking or in a biking distance from the house and there is lots of uh wire that you can be found in in the forest and this is a good drinking water you have sources you have a creeks and me living Outdoors for months and years I've been drinking those water and I still alive and I think I trust this water uh for uh like more than the city wire of course if if it's dirty you can boil it but you can you can find some streams and you can find some creeks in the mountain so I would be more concerned to store the containers not the wire itself because then you need to containers to transport wire and I found those um 4 L uh new type of gallon with the hand like that I found this the most practical one thing that I have it's uh I suggest you to buy it's um uh something like like this this can go on uh propane and you can have those uh small things that uh go disposable ones but they are expensive but this will also fit in any big propane thing so it can be used for heating it can be used for cooking it's can it's C multiple use I will actually going to get more of of those ones [Music] um what else I have yeah I have some like things like garbage bags just different type of plastic bags this is for picnic it's not preparation I bought more of the uh dishwashing soap just but because it was on sale um I bought the this was a big sale for this $150 for a pack of nine so I I bought whatever was left at the store because they usually like $6 for9 and they were $150 was I just bought lots of them yeah that's um I have a concerts here but I'm not really big fan of the concerts it's just you know I I don't won't be recommending but just because it stayes good you know it's it's expensive like you pay in Canada you pay when it's a sale like you can get them at 250 now for one like this sometimes at $2 if you really really lucky but most time at 250 and the regular price it's 350 I have some spaghetti sauce some white beans oh I have or I have lots of cusos um which is not really good to store I talk to the guy at the store because sometimes the Box gets in if you you can maybe freeze it before so you kill all the bugs and it's not really like too much good for health and I have a spaghetti but spaghetti is really cheap uh like this type thing uh if you uh read the ingredients it's like it's not really a good type of spaghetti but it's it's cheap it's just cheap way to nourish your body so I'm just my point is um make um more if uh think about the way to nourish your body because if you become weak and sick of weing uh uh your food if you only eat the white rice it can be really cheap but you know maybe you won't be feeling that good as as you eat the back with anyway if you can share your ideas and comments thanks for watching"

learning and it's not their fault that they're in that [Music] position Iraqi schools are in such bad conditions one room per Building without air conditioning fans Windows solid stes or even toilets Iraqi students like even the small supplies like paper and pencils that American children take for granted what is that for this is so that you can advertise like going to like a office veh cuz we really need to give them school supplies and that's mostly it like right now I'm printing out some sheets so that you can go into to like uh like any like Michaels or like all this people give them information so they can believe you you get me so I don't know how many I'm going to print out now this is like day one project you need some organization nonprofit donate for you so this is how you to come we can ask Superior that's the easiest way ask Superior if they can donate cuz we're doing this type of project and we're going to help the country oh yeah what could be different like markets that we water they give [Applause] it 99 yeah got like an application we have numbers yeah places that we that might sponsor us and give us like for example school supplies like stuff that we can s oh we have like Staples off Depot Walmart keyboard don't read the whole list yeah we got Big Lots yeah we have like lot of it's day one in our project what do we have so far all right so um this is going on all right this the S class period 4 and we're doing um a project on on Iraq and not only are we doing this but we're also going to be donating and sending some real materialistic things to them um I know we we we we messed up um we did hurt Iraq really hard so this this is a sign and symbolism of rebuilding what we did in Destruction for Iraq you know this this is um kind of like like a rejoining of of America and Iraq all right so this is what we're doing we're we're trying to um we're trying to get sources and we're trying to um to find out where what what we can donate to them and what we can do for the cause see what I'm saying um and we ship it out and then that's a good de for us so what are your plans to donate right now uh school supplies and that's it [Music] yeah other than school supplies what else are we sending um we're also sending stuffed animals like you know so they could sleep at night because most of the children have nightmares and like can't sleep or you know just feel lonely at times because of the effects that the war has brought on them so like we're sending AAL stuff to animals like so they could be companions or like someone for them to hold or talk to you know like just basically the whole point is so they won't feel alone because that's one of the major effects that they took okay okay so why did we choose Iraq to send school oh the reason we chose Iraq to send School is because without the school supplies they won't have an education and here in the United States we realize that students don't take advantage of the type of education L USD or teachers provide us while in Iraq there you know students who are actually you know working so we're trying to get a good education and you know get a good career and that's why we chose Iraq I feel that's kind of unfortunate and that we here in the US we have the more opportunities so basically I think that we should use our opportunities to help others in need and what we're doing is just a little tiny step to a bigger project well I feel we should do all in our power to help out for those in need CU I feel that we have many resources that some people will take advantage of which others that don't take advantage of could be used for better use for people in Iraq who would really need that because I believe education is very vital for our future and that's my position on because they poor well I believe we're helping them because we want to help underprivileged kids do better in school and especially for the ones that want to get an education and want to be someone in the future do you think that the Iraqi children will benefit from us anyo supplies I say yes because they don't have the right supplies to get the knowledge or education that we have here because they don't have pencil like well sharpened pencils or papers they probably write on I don't even know what they write on honestly like they're riding on big folders of rocks that just look like some men's with no chairs yeah they need it cuz they're sharing like pencils and paper and of course they'll take um advantage of it because if people would send it and they wouldn't use it then what was the point of us taking our time sending stuff to people who are need take advantage they need a distraction like there bombs and kidnapping they don't have anything else to do so SCH important take advantage and otherwise we wouldn't be shipping stuff [Music] me I I lost the ground somewhere along in the new I would have get up with you all night that I know [Music]"

        "transcript": "hi and welcome to this short video on the snap safe accel gun vault see the inside of it here comes with the cable well show how it works a little bit better inside one things I wanted to demonstrate is just why I picked this gun vault to experiment with now everybody who's got a concealed carry permit realizes that there are going to be places that you cannot take your weapon into and what do you do in your vehicle to keep it securely you don't want just throw it in the glove box I don't think that's a very good idea we want to be responsible gun owners so when you go into say a post office or maybe you have to go into an eating establishment that doesn't allow the firearm you want to be able to securely put it in your vehicle if you have a box like this with a cable you can at least have a reasonably secure against a smash-and-grab sure they can cut the cable they can do a lot of different things but in a short amount of time without making a lot of noise it limits what they can do now the reason I picked this one is probably because of its size some of the other ones were like three inches or maybe 2.2 inches in height this is two inches and it's ten by seven it is the excel a thing about it is you can fit it under the seat on most vehicles and take the key out and we'll slide under the seat now this cable you can secure the box like this on one of the posts of the seat and then put it through this notch here and close it and it's secure now this box is 18 gauge steel and a lot of them are only 20 gauge so this little bit stronger now I kind of thought if you would wrap it around the back here it would actually keep the keep the cable of them we're out of the way of the firearm a lot of to experiment with that now I wouldn't necessarily recommend the driver's side because you don't want on a hook stop the boxes slide out and get in the way of your feet so I probably recommend the passenger side now this is a lot more important in vehicles today because in this old 98 pickup I've got a nice flat spot over here on the on the hump as we used to call it and there's a nice lockbox that as far as I know was not even made anymore I bought it back in the day mail-order and I never could even find the company online and they don't answer the phone number that I originally ordered it from and it was really nice utility here and air in this pickup but most of the new pickups don't have unless you get the real cheap ones don't have any empty space on floored about something like that so that leaves you with an option like this now if this minivan obviously I can't really get the camera in there too well but trust me when I say there's not a lot of room and when do you slide this under it fits just about perfectly it could be just a little bit taller but it's pretty good fit and again if you secure it to some of the hardware denieth and on the passenger side here it's not going to slide out and get in way of your feet trying to drive the vehicle on a fast stop okay here you can see the inside of the snap safe XL the gun vault and it says it looks update full sized 1911 and apparently probably will I don't have a full size here to to demonstrate this is a Glock 21 full-size and they put an extra mag or something there this is what I was indicating before trying to even better look at it where I was just wrapping the cable around the backside here to keep this all the way your firearm otherwise if you just put it in here like this that's okay but you know this does not keep from sliding around and I just kind of like to keep things out away also this is a a steel this is all steel here with the where the latch is that and on the other side of course that is in metal they only probably improve it I would make to the boxes it is I'm probably going to take some foam and you can see that these two sided sticky tape isn't holding the phone here either takes some letter T sided sticky tape or maybe some silicone caulk and kind of make sure those are security in but also thinking of having a well around the outside I mean here you have Springfield army XDS and you know you start to say you could see could slide around in there it's not going to be held snowed by this foam or anything so again I don't rather than have this interfere I'm going to wrap it around I think see how that works out tuck it back in there I'm also I ain't going to try to glue in some some foam around here because I'd like to watch it possible not have my firearms get get scratched up any more than what they have to make one that you carry obviously is kind of finishes are going to be perfect and I've tried some other farms this is actually the excel box they say it's larger is ten by seven by two I could go with smaller one obviously for the XDS you've got a smaller nine millimeter 380 you know certainly for the full-size the Glock or something you're going to want this box but it says a little company full-size revolvers awesome some more pictures of our website I've got a link in the description video and try to have maybe on the screen too about what saw some of the pictures say the Smith & Wesson governor just barely fits and I'm really not comfortable to why it fits because again I don't like to scratch up my firearms and a Smith Wesson model 627 with a five inch barrel does not fit so if you're looking for a rather large size farm you're going to do it for probably a bigger box and I'm going to have some reviews of some other ones as well that have different dimensions and features things I'd like to have probably as a combination of always like to try it out but one of the ones that I saw online actually had some kind of poor reviews about the being plastic inside and and of the combination lock jamming or being easily pride so I didn't like that but this box is 18 gauge so vembur 20 here's the hinge I don't think you can flip the pin out real easily so all in all things be pretty pretty good buy it was less than $25 on amazon and i think i got free shipping too but most links for this you go straight down this on and check it out look at the other reviews does have quite a few reviews most of them are really pretty good and I try not to really review or you know buy anything that doesn't have at least four star above but this isn't a bad little buy fruit for 24 bucks you can slide under the seat and we can attach it again to attach it I just you put it around like at the car seat and then put it here or you like and this is going to be secured it is as much as you can keep your firearm at least at least you're acting in a responsible manner something does happen at least you only do what you could so that's it for this review again some links in the description of the video check it out please come my website and we will see you next time thanks for watching you"

hyped to see what this does the menu feels pretty good working pretty well um the specs said that it needs like a 980 card to actually run it at high quality i'm gonna take a gamble man i mean i'm only running a [\u00a0__\u00a0] uh 290x but you know it's them amd card i'm gonna try to try and run it high see what goes on so uh so let's do this then man press number two summit entertainment oh

apocalypse city man oh so another one of my own turns out to be diverse and by the way there's only one way to survive let's see if you can figure it out what this is fantastic this is absolutely amazing whoa whoa what [\u00a0__\u00a0] hell this is this matrix though this is well color me surprised you are dauntless after all now let's see how smart you are this is fantastic man it's not the apocalypse man whoa whoa this is mental this is so smooth as well man i can't believe the amd 290x is keeping up oh no got a train man coming head on i'll help you out for old time's sake now you don't have much time so the important thing here is to focus on the challenge at hand and not get sidetracked by any unnecessary distractions like me oops all right power of the mind man i think you've got this figured out yeah do some neon [\u00a0__\u00a0] man that's gonna stop this train yeah what this is insane this is insane this is like superb man no one's ever made it past the second simulation cut the subject loose cut me loose come on cut me loose i want to study this one yeah i want to study you too i want to study you too is this a film or what is this like a trailer or something wow they need to make that if that's a film coming out they need to make that man oh that was so cool such an amazing experience i can't believe how well that works and to be fair it said it said that you need a a 980 gtx to run that smooth my card i don't know what what's i don't know it's running on hopes and dreams man but it's keeping up it's just about keeping up at the minute it's doing really really well and it is just a reference 290x as well man but it's it's does really really well i've got some good calling on it and uh yeah it's uh it's done fantastically well to keep up there this this is crazy this is like a superb like i don't i'm a bit blown away i'm a bit left speechless but man i can't wait to show my friends this i really can't wait to show them this experience this is amazing and oh if you guys have got some sort of google cardboard or even if you've got a rift man if you've got a rift you need to check this out straight definitely i mean it it runs it runs so well man it runs perfectly and i think that the future of films this is the future of films man i want to be sitting in a cinema not well not even in a city i don't want to be sitting in my home like watching films where i'm actually part of the set i mean looking around and [\u00a0__\u00a0] going on and maybe even use like my xbox 360 pad to be walking around the set and like you know don't know i don't even know how they're going to do it but i think the first the first ones i should tackle with stuff like final fantasy advent children or some something that's actually created in full 3d you know like a because they look cool as [\u00a0__\u00a0] anyway but something that's created like a 3d movie like that and actually having it so you can explore the set and look at every angle look at everything you want you could watch that movie 50 times and still find new stuff man um hopefully they don't do it with some something like toy story or something pixar stuff i mean yeah it's good yeah it's okay but i really prefer like the style of like final fantasies and stuff like that you know because they're just a lot more badass yeah man anyway that's uh that's enough of my ramble i really hoped you guys enjoyed this and man i can't i'm this is blowing me away this really has blown me away and definitely going in my keeping i'm definitely keeping this one and saving it somewhere so uh thank you very much for watching guys hope to see on the next one take care peace out bye-bye"

        "transcript": "Would you like to know the \neffectiveness of advertising on YouTube? We have studied the results of \neight advertising campaigns for major brands, shown on television and YouTube, \nwith more than 25 thousand  interviews. The campaigns\u2019 average coverage \nreached 4 million consumers of the target audience. Out of these 4 million consumers, \n2 million were in addition to the television coverage, as they had little \nor no exposure to this form of media. This represented an additional\ncoverage of 9%. This study with YouTube \nshows that online video is a very effective method, not only for\nimplementing more significant metrics, but also for achieving additional\ncampaign coverage  in a more efficient way. We even see how in a multimedia campaign, which also included advertising\nin the press, and in a target audience less \naccustomed to online media, individuals between the ages of 35-50, that this form of media \nprovides additional coverage. Online video works and it works particularly well with \npeople who do not watch much television. The results confirm that online\nvideo is here to stay. We have included it as a strategic part  of our advertising campaigns. Our objective of this campaign, the\nlaunch of Diesel Loverdose, was to achieve additional coverage and\nmake an impact on Diesel\u2019s target audience. Thus, YouTube has been an ideal \ncomplement to the television campaign. Adding YouTube to the television plan also means an improvement in \nbrand-metrics. On average, the brand\u2019s advertising\nawareness increased between 5 and 7%. Synergy is increased among those who\nare seldom exposed to television with a 14% increase in image and a 16% \nincrease in purchase intention. It has been interesting to discover \nsegments that are seldom exposed to television. Online video shows some very \ninteresting metrics with regard to message comprehension \nand purchase intention. YouTube helps us to be more efficient \nwhen planning campaigns. For example, in the case of Decathlon from 70% of television coverage onwards,  YouTube is more efficient in adding\nincreased coverage. Especially in the case of Decathlon, reaching the same coverage without using\nYouTube in the campaign would have meant an additional \ntelevision budget of 28%. At Sony, for future campaigns,\nwe have identified the need and importance of spending \nmore budget on the online world, particularly on YouTube due to the results achieved on a quantitative and qualitative scale."

        "transcript": "Hi, I\u2019m Francis,  the host of this show \"Cooking with Dog.\" The hot steam will heat the bowl  and gradually melt the couverture chocolate. When the chocolate is almost melted,  beat the 2 egg whites in a bowl with a hand mixer. When it turns a kind of white,  add the extra fine granulated sugar in 3 steps. Beat until the meringue reaches a stiff peak stage  and has a glossy texture. With the desired consistency,  it will not drop out of the bowl  when it is turned upside down. Now, clean the beaters. Then, beat the heavy cream in a bowl  chilling in ice water. Make sure to beat the egg whites first  and do not reverse the order. When it begins to thicken,  switch to a low speed to help avoid over-beating. Beat until it reaches a soft peak stage as shown. Then, remove the bowl from the ice  to help the cream to mix with the chocolate. Now, remove the bowl of chocolate from the steam. First, add 2 egg yolks and mix with a spatula. Next, add about one third of the meringue  to the chocolate and combine thoroughly. This will soften the chocolate  and help to keep the foam of the next meringue from breaking. Add another one third of the meringue. This time, carefully combine the mixture  to keep the foam from breaking. Then, add the rest of the meringue  and carefully mix likewise. Now, add the whipped cream. Add the rum.  And combine the mixture evenly with minimal folding actions. Then, pour the chocolate mousse into the 6 ramekins. Arrange the surface of the mousse with the back of a spoon. Now, the chocolate mousse is completely chilled and firmed up. Sprinkle on the cocoa powder. Squeeze out the whipped cream  and garnish with the strawberry. And now, it is ready to serve! Make sure to use high quality fresh eggs  whose shells are intact. If you are not sure about the quality of the eggs,  please do not try this recipe. Don\u2019t over-heat the chocolate otherwise it will reduce its flavor  and might cause separation. Good luck in the kitchen."

        "transcript": "hello and welcome everyone this is type V3 with an SRC review of what's arguably the most important Super Robot of them all mazinger Zed piloted by Kabuto Koji and forged from choken itself this is the classic gagy hero that influenced an entire genre originally released back in 2010 as the first entry in the then all-new super Rob boken toy line Bandai made sure to put their best foot forward with this mazinger figure in its shows everything about its look and feel scream premium in quality the overall sculpt remains faithful to the anime and the paintwork has been precisely applied resulting in crisp and clean lines a combination of metallic metal flake and high gloss finishes were used and give off a delicious appearance when hit with light the head sculpt is wonderful and I love how the inside of it was painted a flat black the removable hover piler is great too though I do wish the red paint were metallic and finish now there are some disappointing areas to this figure mold flash exists on the inner seams of the thighs and I think the design of the shoulder joint definitely conflicts with the smooth looking Line work that the Torso is going for however these are both minor complaints to what I believe is the most distracting feature of them all the four visible screws and mazinger's back especially the two silver ones on the waist certainly not the most impressive section to this toy standing at just over 5 in tall mazinger is fairly small but he does make up for that with his diecast content the chest lower legs and some of the joints are metal and will surely give you that cool feel of super alloy Zed and not only not only does he feel cool he also feels very Compact and he feels like this good weighty action figure with a lot of presence um in terms of articulation though it's very uh it's similar to what we've seen from the SRC lineup so you got the great emotive range of that head uh the shoulders are on actually there they're different they're on more like sh figuart style uh ball joint within a ball joint shoulders whereas newer src's have the swingout arm that I think looks better and works better this goes with an older styling that has that sort of cutaway feature which is it does the job but it's uh it's definitely not as good as the the newer Renditions everything else is pretty much the same though I mean you got the great torso joint with the extendable click although it's not as extending as I thought it would be the uh arms are a single joint but they are collapsible here so you can get some good range balljointed wrists the pull down hip the collapsible section panel here for the knee and the balljointed foot which actually can't pull down to extend even more so on the articulation front if you were to compare this to say the newer Shin mazinger he doesn't quite hold up to the to the successor here but he does pretty good for his age the one thing I will say is that there are parts that seem kind of loose I don't know if it's actually loose though I mean like this arm for example it's really easy to nudge and and and and move around but the thing is it'll stay where I want it to stay but see that it kind of just falls out uh the hips the hips aren't loose at all but they're very again they're very easy to nudge and I just don't know if that's going to get worse over time or if that's just how the uh the quality is of this figure now he also comes with a Tashi stage adapter which you can just plug right here and then you can put it on a tasi stage and then from here he can he can Poe now this is one because small and he's the one of the few src's that can actually use a tomashi stage and not fall off erratically or or just he he let's just say he's safe sitting there uh and finally he also can benefit from the crossover joint feature I mean you can switch out the arms and he does have the peg hole in his back to put on any sort of backpack you choose so yeah there you go good poseability but just not quite as awesome as his success mazinger comes with fists for beating on bad guys as well as open Palms which come off a little creepy you also get a pair of gripping hands to wield the mazinger blade its chrome and gold finish may be simple but it looks great nonetheless the next item in the box is the right arm only reinforced rocket punch which also has its own Fist and open Palm attachment is simple as all you do is slide it over mazinger's arm it's definitely an awesome accessory though due to its larger construction elbow articulation is somewhat hindered as for other accessories well that's kind of it no effect parts for the iron cutter rust hurricane or even the famous breast fire though to be completely honest I can't say I'm even the slightest bit surprised or even disappointed because ultimately super robota Goen mazinger Zed retails for a modest $35 and when compared to other figures of similar price I'd say you're getting an equal amount of value in the Box much more when you consider that this is a diecast action figure now I'll admit I much prefer the modern stylings of the SRC mazinger Zed and on paper it's probably the better package overall but this mazinger this is the one you want it's the first the original the one laced with history and has a story to tell I've always been a firm believer that there's a handful of robots that should be represented in every toy collection and mazinger Zed is easily one of them so if you've ever wanted a relatively inexpensive way to portray this iconic character on your shelf in physical form then look no further than this Super Robot shoken release I can't recommend this one enough anyway anyways this has been type V3 thanks for watching and I hope you enjoyed this review of course this mazinger isn't quite complete and is in dire need of a crucial add-on"

        "transcript": ">> We're trying to leverage the existing\norganization that you have within your school. And so we get this information from your\nstudent information system automatically with our integration. Essentially, you have a main campus account,\nyou might have some different colleges, like the engineering college\nand the business college, and the separate departments underneath these. In our terminology, this is called a subaccount,\nand we just re-create the organization that you already have, and then we\nleverage this for learning outcomes. So, how this happens is that you can\ncreate a learning outcome at any level of this hierarchy including\nat the course level as well. So, for instance if I created a learning\noutcome that I've named number three here in the engineering school, this learning\noutcome will now propagate and be available for alignment in all the subdepartments\nand any of the courses underneath them. Likewise, in the business school,\nif I create a learning outcome, it will automatically propagate. If I want to have a learning outcome that\nI'm going to align across departments with different schools, we go up one\nmore level and create a learning outcome and it will all apply to all the\ndifferent courses across campus. I'm in my account administration,\nand I can see my learning outcomes, and I have an outcome group where I've\norganized all the different learning outcomes that I am using for the Bachelor\nof Business program. So, for each of these learning\noutcomes, I can give it a quick name. I can come out with the different details of it\nthat expresses \"This is the learning objective that after a student has gone through\nour material or through our program that they're going to have this\ncharacteristic or they have acquired this skill. This is the outcome that is\ndesired for the student to have.\" I can review this, but I can also edit these\nand create these different learning outcomes. We use a rich content editor, so\nyou can give a good description of, if you're looking at a student\nartifact, \"How should I assess this?\" We also set up a specific assessment framework. You can add different ratings\nhere, as fine-grain level of learning outcomes as you would like. The points here can be used for scoring or not. This is where set your custom scale. So, for example, with this\n\"exceeds expectations,\" when we give you the raw data back, we\nactually say that they were assessed as a two, so you can interpret and create your\nown custom scales for your own analysis. Now, with learning outcomes, you still want\nto know if they've achieved mastery or not. This is why we use our threshold, so you can\nstill have the fine-grain level of criteria in assessment, but you still have the\ncourse-grain level if they are competent or not. And here according to the scale that I've\ncreated, that if they have a one or above, then I'm telling the system that it should be\nconsidered as mastery or competency according to a certain learning outcome,\nand below it is not. To do alignment of learning outcomes in\nInstructure Canvas, we use our rubric tool. When I'm creating a rubric, I\ncan create different criteria that would apply to just this assignment only. I can also click this thing\nfor finding outcome criteria, which will show me all the different\nlearning outcomes that have propagated down the organizational hierarchy that\nI explained earlier into this course. I can easily see what the learning outcome is,\nits description, its customized grading scale or assessment scale, and I can choose whether\nor not I want to use this for scoring. So, if I uncheck this and I add this outcome,\nnow it adds it directly into my rubric. Now, that's going to align this specific\nlearning outcome with all the content as part of this assignment and all future student\nsubmissions as part of it as well. You can see here since I'm\nnot using it for scoring, it doesn't update the total points\npossible for this assignment. So, I can just do assessment\nto the student as well. With the rubric tool, I can align\nthis specific assignment or activity with multiple learning outcomes\nas well if I'm using it for both. And we just mark each specific row or\ncriteria with this little sun icon to show that this is aligned with a learning outcome. Now I'd like to show you\nhow to do the assessment from a teacher perspective\nusing these learning outcomes. In our Speed Grader, we give the\nassignment, and when I edit the rubric, I can see that I just have another\nrow for these learning outcomes. I just use it just normally like I do my normal\nrubric, and this will automatically tabulate and record that I have assessed this\nstudent using this specific criteria and what they achieved in their assessment\nautomatically into those reports. There's a little dialog box right here where\nI can give additional feedback in addition to the rubric as well on each learning outcome. The idea here is that we shouldn't have\nto go to a separate system in order to track learning outcomes and the\nobjectives of our university or institution. The idea here is that we've incorporated\nthe best uses of learning outcomes into the actual assessment\nwhen the teacher is doing it. So, it doesn't create any additional work for\nthe teacher to contribute to learning outcomes for their own pedagogical purposes or for\nthe accreditation for the entire institution. For every outcome that you create,\nwe have a live updating report that shows all the artifacts\nthat have been assessed recently across the entire system\nusing the specific outcome. I can see Laura has been assessed and that she\nachieved mastery on this in the business course. I can also see Jin Li [phonetic] in the accounting course using the same\nlearning outcome aligned across courses, and he also achieved mastery\naccording to my own criteria. If I click on this specific artifact, I'm\nactually presenting with this specific and exact artifact that the student turned in. I can see the conversation that this\nstudent has been having with the teacher about this specific artifact\nin this learning activity. If I click on the rubric, I can\nsee exactly how they were assessed from either the teacher or the other assessor. This little sun icon shows that this\ncriteria is aligned with a learning outcome, because you can have also\nassignment-level criteria as well. You'll see a drop-down list here, is because a\nstudent work can be assessed by multiple people. A good case of this is where a student is\nassessed why their peers in a peer review. You can also have someone outside of\nthe teacher do these other assessments. And so you can see each way that they\nhave been assessed using this criteria with the learning outcomes. If I click on the student now, I can see all\nthe different outcomes that have been aligned with any of the work that the student\nhas inside of their courses and whether or not the student is achieving competency\naccording to my own learning outcomes that I have set up in my framework. So, I can see that they've achieved\ncompetency on their last submission according to the outcome across all of their courses. Of course, all the data with learning\noutcomes is available in a raw form so you can do your own analysis in addition to\nall the built-in reports that we also provide."

        "transcript": "hey everybody I'm Chris wook while buy an audio might be a familiar name if you're from the UK they've only just started to bring their products to North America those products include the soundbook X3 pretty fancy looking Bluetooth speaker with some pretty cool features now it might have the look but does it have the sound to back it up well that's why we're here isn't it opening up the box of course the first thing you will see is the speaker itself rounding at the package you'll find the usual accessories a 3.5 mm audio cable AC adapter with us UK and EU Outlet configurations and finally the manual now let's take a closer look at the speaker the soundbook X3 is undeniably stylish from the metal to the built-in cover which opens like a book to the way the speaker is highlighted in the center this thing just looks cool the model we're looking at is in silver and blue but it's also available in black and orange if I'd watched orange as the New Black I'd make some sort of joke here but I got nothing of course looks aren't everything what good is a speaker if it falls apart within a few months this doesn't seem like it'll be a problem with the soundbook X3 the speaker has a solid weighty feel and while I didn't toss it at the wall during testing it feels like this speaker could easily stand up to a few drops or bumps open the cover on the soundbook X3 for the first time and it will automatically enter pairing mode making Bluetooth pairing a snap you can also pair using NFC but it's a little weird compared to other speakers since the NFC logo is located inside the cover I.E the part that is normally face down on whatever surface the speaker is on it's not a huge deal but it's a little confusing at first of course if you rather not use Bluetooth or you're connecting a device that doesn't support Bluetooth you can connect via the audio in Jack on the back this speaker also has a line out Jack which for example could let you use it to add Bluetooth to a larger home stereo setup up looking at buttons there are five on the top panel the power button in the middle also allows you to switch between Bluetooth auxin and FM radio modes you've also got dedicated volume buttons and buttons for skipping forward and backward that are also used for tuning in FM radio mode ban claims up to 10 hours of battery life for the soundbook X3 and while the various modes can lead to a lot of variation in battery life I found in my testing that I did indeed get around 10 hours this was at reasonable volume so expect less if you really like to crank it up to help save battery life this model includes a battery saving feature that automatically lowers the volume as the battery starts to run out the sound book X3 also features a USB port on the back that allows you to use it to charge your other devices of course this will kill the speaker's battery life but we never get sick of seeing this feature in testing the soundbook X3 I use the FM radio a bit but mainly use Bluetooth and the 3.5 mm audio jack with a ton of different music formats and a bunch of genres as well as audio books and podcast for a short playlist of a few of the many songs I listen to while testing the X3 check the video description as with every Bluetooth speaker what you have the soundbook X3 resting on is going to affect how much bass you get but with this no matter what I did there just wasn't a whole lot of Basse to be had a lot of speakers make up for this by boosting the lower mids but the X3 doesn't in general mid-range is a little boxy and muffled sounding Highs are much clearer but almost too much there's a crispy sounding Sizzle to the highend that could get unpleasant while the speaker in general sounds a little unfocused nobody can accuse it of being quiet the soundbook X3 gets loud and it doesn't break up when you crank the volume while there isn't any stereo separation to speak of this speaker definitely sounds bigger than it is if the soundbook X3 was selling for Less maybe $200 it would be easier to recommend but for $299 it just doesn't have the sound quality it needs for that price tag I really wanted to like this and some features the FM radio and line out in particular might be enough to make it worth it for certain people but for the rest of us there are better speakers out there for the same price or less we're giving the buy an audio soundbook X3 a 6.5 out of 10 and that wraps it up for this one everybody if you're looking for a little more detail check out the written review over sound.com you can find a link to the article as well as to our forums in case you have any questions down in the video description now are you looking for more Awesome Audio stuff then why not subscribe there is a button for exactly that purpose right down below my face I'm Chris wook and thanks for watching"

side bang or it has front bangs or however way that you decide to wear it and thumbs up this video video if you want to see how I remove a sewing with an invisible part I am I take out all my sewings

        "transcript": "our teachers whether we meet them in a formal educational setting or whether we just meet them in in life um are the first people other than our parents really that leave indelible marks on our lives that really change who we are and help to form who we are I come from a family of Educators so I was really thrilled to be able to come and share here with you if I hadn't ended up being a writer uh I think I would have been a teacher but I became a writer because a teacher made a writer out of me and uh and but writers end up being teachers more than you'd think so I feel like I belong here with all of you if not for teachers one of those special teachers who made a teach out of me probably would never have become my teacher at all so my story in many ways is a story of Education it was actually though a very special lady named Miss crack har who first gave me the idea of becoming a writer in my family there were some great storytellers and some great letter writers and back in that day sometimes we recorded our letters on real toore tapes and sent them back and forth between family members but the people in my family were farmers and computer programmers and shopkeepers and nobody really thought a writer was something you would be for a living and I might never have thought of it either to tell you the truth if it hadn't been for Miss crack har I was a shy transfer student coming into a new school halfway through the first grade and she was my first grade teacher and this school happened to be in Northboro Massachusetts we moved around a lot when I was young and we had come there from Florida so it felt very very foreign to me this whole concept of putting on eight layers of clothing and gashes and all these things and there were hooks in the hallway in that school and you would go to your hook and you would strip all that stuff off and leave it there on your hook and your gashes along the hall to go in and what happened very very often because it's so snowy there is we had to stay in for indoor recess which for me was an absolutely Mor in concept having come from Florida I had very little experience with indoor recess and I was absolutely mortified because what you had to do at indoor recess was ask somebody to play a board game with you or something and I was terrified by that because I thought the person would say no and then I would just die of embarrassment or something right there and so what I was doing one day when I was fairly new in this school was I was sitting there writing a story because you had to do something during indoor recess so I was writing a story and Miss crack har came up and she started to read the story over my shoulder and she was saying things like oh this is a great story and I wonder what happens next and I was writing faster because you know I was kind of a shy kid who flew under the radar i' had been in a private school before that and I'd had a grouchy nun for a teacher and I really really did not want to be noticed by her but miss crack har was being so encouraging that you know I was thrilled that she had noticed me and I hurried and I finished that story and I don't remember anything about the story except at the end of it was something about a boy going in a bear cave and uh for years I couldn't have told you too much about that moment except I remembered Mrs crack har taking those pages and straightening them on the desk and saying to me you are a wonderful writer and I thought I am a wonderful writer and it's funny how you have those little defining moments in life but that was one of mine I never ever thought of myself the same way again after that I went from being a shy transfer kid who uh didn't quite fit in and and couldn't work up the guts to get to know anybody to being a wonderful writer and then miss cart did the most amazing wonderful thing she took that story and she read it to the rest of the class and I remember when she finished that story and the boy boy went into the bar cave every kid in that class all those kids I was too shy to get to know looked at me and said what happens next and I was hooked that went from being the end to the end of chapter one and I would write stories and Miss crack har would share them with the class and she was the most fascinating teacher um she left something so permanent in my life and I was only in her classroom for a little while but she left something really permanent and really good with me and that's a pretty big deal when you think about it to leave something permanent with somebody that's good and that stays forever she taught me to believe in myself and never to underestimate the power of a good story sometimes when I should have just told the truth I'm sure but she loved books and writing and she always had us performing little puppet shows and plays and things in her class and we were always doing something fascinating that that was the contrast because I had come out of a school where I didn't like school and I was afraid of the teacher and it was a horrible thing for me the day I figured out that when you do this the teacher can still actually see you she's just seeing you with your hand up over your eyes it was horrible when I figured that out in the nuns classroom because then there was just no Escape but in Miss crack heart's classroom every day was a new adventure and we were always doing interesting things and for years I couldn't have told you whether she was a young teacher or an old teacher I couldn't have told you anything about her but I could have told you what we did in that class and I could have told you that she told me I was a wonderful writer and I tried years later after the book started being published to look her up and I couldn't find her but Miracle of Miracles a reporter in Northboro Massachusetts picked up the story when I dedicated my third book the language of sycamores to her and found Miss crack har and I was able to thank her and tell her what an effect she had on my life in the first grade in those few months [Music]"

Text slide: EARLIER THAT DAY Student #1: I thought I was doing so well getting up early to find the sources for my research project. But, that quickly turned into a nightmare even though I knew I wanted to do my project on Eco-friendly design. I still had to find the books on my topic. But, that wasn't the hard part it was getting organized. Then my pencil broke, so I had to print out tons of paper it was so frustrating but little did I know it would help me to learn a cool new library feature and meet a great new guy. Text slide: BACK IN THE LIBRARY WIU Student #3: I'm sorry you okay. Student #1: No, I'm just having trouble finding these books I think I lost a call number earlier I just really need some help.

        "transcript": "and joining us now on SportsCenter LeBron James LeBron NBA MVP what does that title mean to you um I don't know man you know I one thing that I try to be i try to be the MVP to clap the Cleveland Cavaliers every night I step out on the court you know to try to help us be a better team and be you know a competitor every night we step on the court man and you know i'm happy that i can do that for my team do you think you've become the face of the NBA I don't know that's I don't even know if that's for me to say I just think that I go out every night or every day you know and try to do the things that I know I'm capable of doing and that's playing a game at a high level and and I'm humbled and I'm thankful for the fact that people see that I do that and by giving me this award I really appreciate you made the announcement at your old high school st. Vincent's st. Mary's why'd you do that there's just a special place to me man you know you have dreams as a kid man we're real young and some of those dreams you may not believe that they could come true you know once i came to high school and once i came to this high school in particular those dreams started you know almost felt like they could become reality man and you know this is they hold a special place for me man and you know you know I want three state championships here I met a lot of good friends I met a lot of people man but that's still in my life today so on this at this high school right here means a lot you're a very composed young man but during your press conference I was looking at your eyes describe what was going on inside you that you were trying to hold inside you oh I don't know I'm probably had a straitjacket man because I don't know how held those tears in man but uh you know I definitely was tearing up on the inside but you know I have so many memories man being here in Akron and growing up in Akron just just 25 miles away from Cleveland man and seeing all my friends and family there's the emotional day for all of us and to be up here and represent my family in this fashion is unbelievable all that being said and with your connection to a cure in the entire area why not announce right now that you're going to stay in cleveland when you become a free agent after 22 uh you know one day I can and those that are I am happy in Cleveland man I love it man died it's unbelievable with the city of Cleveland and what the fans of Klima has done for me let's talk a little hoops most picking the Cavs Lakers final you lost two regular-season games at home but LA was the only team to beat you with the starters playing how much is that concern you you know it it doesn't concern me but you know to even think I'd look at a Cavs Lakers finals man it's too far to even Fitch you know one thing that we were we worried about the Atlanta Hawks a very explosive team coming into our building tomorrow night man and the quarterfinals so uh you know hopefully we can get to that point but that's that's far away we're looking at the now and not you know you know the later you know we're looking at you know the Atlanta Hawks are preparing for them but you know everyone's talking about you versus Coby absolutely absolutely but uh you know son you got to work your way up that tree branch that's true you're absolutely right we continue with LeBron James brought to you on behalf of Kia Motors which donated a car today in honor of him winning MVP LeBron you talked in the past about the LeBron James brand what does an MVP award do for that brand oh it shines a lot of light on it you know I think I just try to you know I just try to be you know the person I could be on and off the court men every day you know I don't change for anybody i'm not you know there's no cover up you know and i try to be productive in everyday life you know and that that's geared towards basketball and that's geared towards being a father and a friend and just be all I can be and you know every day when I wake up and you know for the brand I think it is great before me as a human being is more than that you're the first MVP from Cleveland since the Browns brians site back in nineteen eighty you and your guys have been having so much fun as evidenced in this commercial you all shot take a look well hey you know I've done the same thing when I got some brand-new sneakers this is nothing new I mean really how are you all able to be so loose at this tense part of the season man is just it's the camaraderie that we have man it's like being it's like being on the team with your brother man it's like 14 brothers in the locker room and we all get along we all go out to eat we do a lot of things together male we're on the plane we all you know laughing joke together it's an unbelievable team that we have that's off the court man and it just transformed to the court man there's one thing about those jada that we don't do we don't disrespect the game in no way you know every night we go out on that court we all business but the game of basketball should always be fun you don't ever want to take that away from let's compare LeBron both you and MJ winning mvps in your first six seasons he was 26 you're 24 however you have already led your team to the NBA Finals something Michael Jordan did not do in his first six years say you're a GM who do you pick you a mic if I'm a GM who do I pick me or Mike hmm oh you gotta take Mike man Michael Jordan man was um Michael Jordan was unbelievable he was like you know he was like x-men out there on the court you you need the things that he did on the court was like anybody ever doing that before and I by every angle anybody won't do it after MJ was my MJ is unbelievable but you have already been to the final something he didn't do in your two years younger he may be an x-man but you're the you're the top x-man you like Wolverine you got the movie coming up man yeah I do got the movie coming out morning the game October second yeah let's plug that in there but um MJ was great man and one thing I charted I try to be great awesome and every night I go on the court I try to be the best player I can be and one thing MJ didn't do he won his first title in his seventh year in the NBA so hopefully I could pass him on that too and winning in my six all right we'll see your four-year-old son LeBron James jr. the prince has become a youtube sensation who put it up how many recruiting calls have you gotten so far ah LeBron James jr. has got a couple recruiting calls already man y'all got y'all got them all on YouTube the iron plugged me and y'all got my kid on YouTube already maybe we see you my school's chasing either hopefully by the time LeBron come out you know I'm saying you can put the rule back in there he comes through out of high school he can help daddy with some of them bills around the house I hear you I hear I understand how that is trust me hey we're running the commercial again here at ESPN I just want to know did scott van pelt ever give you back your chair hey Scott

        "transcript": "covering the achievement was a the attiny was it are the vital points strikes so these are the points that are not covered just by pushing if it's a gentle push it's one thing if it's struck it's something else again and the reason that you strike is because it would be buried very deep a typical example would be along this area here you have a lot of very susceptible points from here up to the elbow but you can't get up and because when you push them does nothing and if he shots exist any creates tension does even less and if you have a person who is fit and who is in good shape and you push on those you're wasting your time unless that you use skin tagging which we will be dealing with later now the reason that you see your strike on the a-team E is for to get a reaction of the snatch and comfort reaction okay where you hit and they pull the hand back and bring it to the chest photographer to give comfort so the one skill that is needed above this above anything else on this is that you must have good reactions if you look at something and you try to George I was in the traditional martial arts a little box like this and you want to put your tailor technique in there then that's that's a competition skill that's that's nothing to do with combat in combat you have to take the whole picture so when someone puts up a guard okay and they have the hands out this is the first opening that you have we go back to the opening a video where I was talking about breaking down the fortress this is your wall you can snatch it this you're not going to get much of a grip because it is an active situation and the first thing it's going to do is going to pull that out of your hand alright so what you have to do is you have to create a reaction so you strike now he's open yeah because you can see the the stiffness reaction that really brings it back to the body in this is strike upwards he was in the tongue if strike upwards and yet by not trying to focus on one area you have to build your skills to the point of where when he's punching you can punch at his punch and you can be assured of getting it so he's fit he's punching to me okay and you can take that finger off and this brings in another skill altogether which is not going to be covered on this set of DVDs but it brings in another area of bone breaking because this is to say this is the same concept so you have to soften your technique so that it has the maximum effect for the minimum amount of effort so when you say how many strikes forward you drop okay and you're still not aim for me aim for me okay I hit you're aiming over my head yeah Wow okay so you don't look at it you hit it this huh okay all right best point if you want to disable somebody as just on the bridge of the nose if you want to stop them from fighting you don't strike the nose you slap the nose because when you slap the nose the eyes fill with tears and this the whole thing cringes for comfort its discomfort so you need to comfort yourself you need to to reassert your control over yourself before you can start dominating again and that's that's that is a cure for aggression so when he's moving forward you don't look at it strike it out you you reinforce yeah so this here defensive confirmation and I would not normally stop here you keep going you keep going yeah now on the next one you're using a slapping technique rather than using a specific knuckle strike you're using a slapping technique so you bring it across okay and the slap causes a different type of reaction you're striking friend here on this area here this area here is very rich in nerve endings as all the nerves have to come true the bones on the elbow that stretched around they come through so when they come true they are still under tension and it doesn't matter whether the arm is bent or whether it is straightened out rigid and the best thing to do is for to catch it in a natural motion because when you catch it in motion it hyper flexes so you get an over stretching of the joint and the damage is being done there as well so you okay and now he's off balance yeah so you aggravate the situation yeah damn sorry Tony now"

        "transcript": "we finished our pets too quiet now we're going to make the same recipe just a literary ation to it and we're going to add some almond flour to replace some of the flour with blanched almond flour which you can find at any chef supply store or natural food store even and that's going to give it kind of a flakier crispy or texture to it and a great great great flavor so the first thing we're going to do again is to cream our butter in our sugar together the same as before and i like to use organic sugar as much as possible this is evaporated cane juice all it is really is just like regular table sugar only it has been as processed it hasn't been bleached and it's got a bit thicker grain so if you're making something like a rustic tart it's really nice to use because it Browns it really nicely and it gives a great nutty flavor to it okay so I'm just going to scrape down the bowl and we're going to finish up this tart shell now the difference between a tart and a pie is that a tart has kind of a cookie crust to it not as flaky as a pie dough pie dough is flakier and sometimes as a top two it tarts always are just plain on the bottom have no top so keep creaming this and while it's going i'm just going to break my eggs into the bowl there we go great no shells just going to add them in one at a time okay make sure that my vanilla is at hand the same vanilla I was using before with a little vanilla bean seeds in there I just absolutely love it I wish that you could smell through here but you'll just have to take my word for it it's so delicious all right Ramos there I'm going to need to scrape it one more time before I add in the other ingredients the almond flour is that I was talking about just a minute ago it's really a delicious delicious ingredient it can be a little bit expensive let me tell you why the um you can get plain almond flour and you'll see there'll be little specks of brown in it sometimes it's just called ground almonds but when you're making something that's going to be a little bit finer and texture you want to try and buy blanched almond flour and this is what it looks like they've blanched the almonds they've rubbed off the skin and then they pulverize it in and turn it into kind of a flower like texture it is a little bit more expensive but it keeps forever so if you get a nice big container if it's on sale just keep it in your freezer your refrigerator and it lasts for a long time okay we're ready to add our vanilla now again nice dull up there just love the way it smells so good okay just where I add in the blanched almonds and you don't have to use almond flour if you want to use hazelnut flour it's delicious and then maybe add some chocolate shavings inside and make this tart crust with a hazelnut flavor and a little bit of chocolate it's really delicious you can add in some orange zest it's so good really really versatile you're going to be adding in chocolate shavings wait until the very end or just blend them into your flour and that way it'll keep them kind of suspended in there and it'll keep it from melting too much if you add the chocolate now and you're going to spend a lot more time turning it it'll melt the chocolate and you won't get those nice little chunks in there now I don't believe in sifting so all I'm doing is aerating the flour here flour into our mixture and then get the nice towel trick down again don't want flower flying everywhere especially if those water near the table there's nothing worse than cleaning that up here's a little tip though if you are washing up bowls or anything that's got flour on it use cold water because if hot water hits it it's just going to immediately cook the flour onto your surfaces and then it's really nothing to clean okay here we go just give it a few more quick turns here that's it here we are let's just wrap it up can get kind of messy and this this has a different texture than the last cookie dough we did or butts to quit and so we're just going to clean it up a little bit more crumbly and that's what gives it the great great texture after you bake it okay here we are perfect there we go give any questions whatsoever you can email us at guam on DS desserts at yahoo com you can visit our website we have some hints and tips on there sometimes or you can subscribe to our newsletter where we send out a recipe every week some great little tip let's before just pressing it into the plastic there we go beautiful nice little package ready for the refrigerator you want to make sure that it's tightly wrapped in the plastic because if it's not it will absorb all the flavors from your refrigerator and nobody wants a garlic scented vanilla pastry crust it's just not delicious so hang on a second and I'll show you how to make the same version in chocolate"

        "transcript": "so hey what's up guys uh it's pun off for hire bringing you the next gun of the week this is the third gun of the week in a row and I am proud to say that I love the hell out of you guys you guys are really actually taking this series like crazy and I'm getting a lot more support and people saying hey you should try tossing one of these each week up on Machinima or something like that and there's actually a lot of feedback because I I I've noticed in the community a lot of people are like no don't put your show or don't put this video up on Mach I'm going to keep it for your viewers but this is this is you know a little Flex ible because even if I put one up a week on the Machinima that's still you know at least two or three of these that go on my channel um I don't know um but now that we're in it we're obviously in a new week and I using the MP5K and in this one I am using the silencer attachment and uh so basically what it comes down to is with this gun you don't want to play on a map like derail but you know I felt like I wanted to put this up I think this was only like a 31 and5 or something like that and for a short range gun like the MP5K on a map like derail that's really not bad um it's really a uh it's hard to explain it's a really good gun given the map and uh I know I use skid r a lot and stuff like that skid R is is is actually probably the only map that I would be safe running around with the silencer on this gun the only map unless I plan on completely patrolling only the Alleyways on like flla I'd never used the silencer on this gun to be completely honest is it's not a bad attachment for it it's just the range on this gun already is is piss poor so if you guys that actually run around with this gun this is my advice for you the guys that run around with this gun and have it silenced pick a new gun and silence it or put a different attachment on it and uh for some of you guys that don't understand why I say this stay tuned for the next few videos and uh and watch what happens with the Red Dot site and the holographic and I guarantee you'll have a change of heart um the fourth video the fourth attachment for this week it was going to be in between one of two things obviously either rapid fire or Kimbo and everybody knows what this gun is like with a Kimbo it's one of the best attachments for the MP5K and uh I I love the hell out of the MP5K in a Kimbo so one thing I never really see is rapid fire on it so I decided to run around and you know piss myself off as much as I can you know I like to get the estrogen boiling in my system yeah I said estrogen don't judge me me um and it and it just pisses me off because rapid fire I mean unless it is Direct close combat it's it's a horrible perk and and you zoom in you can't it's even hard to burst fire I mean a lot of these other guns you burst fire and you can semic control them oh my God this thing is just like spraying everywhere man it's like when you wake up in the morning you got to take a piss and you just don't know what the hell's going to happen and it's it's horrible I I couldn't stand it so uh I got a game it's a fast game so it's not like it was was a slow paced game it was a really fast game it was like a 3 or 4 minute game uh for the rapid fire gameplay and it was only like 24 kills but that's the whole point of this of this series is is showing the guns what I think about them not necessarily putting up Jesus gameplay but putting up you know what I think about the perks and you know some of these attachments will be horrible with some of these guns when I've got to use like the silencer on you know like the l86 or something dude I'm going to be horrible with it and you know there's going to be a lot of things that I need to judge things with and it's just going to really come down to a lot of things and you guys are going to have to understand some of these games might only be you know like 30 and 15 others might be you know 50 and 10 it it's going to vary but uh I've had to uh pick up a few guns in this game I know I'm not running around the whole time with the MP5 um I don't expect I expect to rush with the MP5K that's the only thing you can do with the MP5K is Rush that is the gun of rushing for this game um if if you decide you want to camp do not use the MP5 um basically I think it's it's it's going to be really hard you're going to have to you know wait later on but silencer I'd never suggest I'd put the I'd put it in like third place only like right in front of Rapid Fire for this gun and then the Red Dot or holographic is beasty on it um I prefer the Red Dot over the holographic on this gun and uh you'll you'll see why the next video will be up probably within the next couple days with this gun I believe I go like 50 and N straight rushing on underpass so and that was the the first game I use the attachment and that's saying something because I'm not used to this gun I think it's garbage and I don't know and one more thing is for you guys that have never tried it out I tried rushing around with Marathon lightweight ninja with this on and uh well it was unsilenced I was using the Red Dot site on another game and then I ran around Marathon lightweight and uh Steady Aim using the MP5 those are some two lethal combos if you're really a hardcore rusher and that's what I think about people is people judge so harshly on things people that Rush as crazy as I do with the MP5K they Stack Up on death deaths mean nothing to me if you get 72 kills in a domination and you've got 40 deaths that's a good game to me I know it might not be you know as good as what you'd want to see on Machinima or something like that but any anytime that you're rushing around your non-stop all go and you've got a close combat gun then that's impressive to me and uh I'm not asking for much um this is probably not the best gun I'd never use him like search or anything like that but if you do do it try it with the other SES first give you know three or four games with each either the holographic or the red site or both and uh despite what people think they are two different kinds of sites so uh I don't know go go give this a go uh do not play it on a map like this but I I wanted to put this up on derail because it wasn't a bad score it's on a big map and uh I think I Patrol it properly how to actually get to close combat situations um even though on TDM they usually don't spawn way too far away but at the same time there's a lot of hills and everything like that with the you know horrible accuracy of this gun in the first place you know you're you're you're more inclined to miss a lot more and it it gets a little crazy sometimes uh the gun's really not that bad but it's it's it's down there on my list um I I there's only one gun I dislike using more than this one and that is the l86 and uh I don't I don't know you guys you guys find your own Groove with this gun I know a lot of people like this gun A lot of people like why the hell do you hate it so much and I just I just hate it it's like the abortion child of this game I don't know I just I can't stand in the MP5 but it was voted so I'm going to go ahead and do it uh one more thing I want to announce if you guys have actually sat through this part um red di side will be up in the next couple weeks hopefully the first video I will put up for the gun of the week next week will be up on Machin one of those videos will be up there but in the meantime in the meantime I want somebody to uh do me a favor if you can do intros yourself or you know an intro guy get a hold of him and have him contract or contract me have him contract me you know what I mean have him contact me I'm willing to give a a shout out and have some sort of like agreement partnership with somebody that's really good with intromaker put them on my channel as my intro maker and give him a shout out or

        "transcript": "[Music] all right we've got a check engine laid on went ahead and hooked up my uh code reader we pulled up a p302 the truck runs like complete crap now as far as like the do-it-yourself person they're just going to plug in their code reader and they're going to pull up a 302 my scan tools a little bit better so my you might not be able to see this but my scan tool is reading live misfire and number two is just falling on its face so here we are p302 cylinder number two misfire and we have the check engine light on now I've already gone ahead and removed the resonator you've seen that like three times now so we're not going to show that part again so what we're going to do here number two coil is going to go on five number two plug is going to go on three pretty easy right damn it a little [\u00a0__\u00a0] to get unplugged that's why I'm unpluging when I'm doing the plug change I guess it really doesn't matter which you know which two you swap as long as you don't put the the plug and the coil and swap them both with the same cylinder I mean you're not really going to isolate anything all right so we got these two plugs are switched going to take the one coil that was on number two we're going to put him in number five going take number five coil put it in number two now on your code reader you probably want to clear the codes now before um starting the engine and the reason is is PCM will be more likely to set a po300 because it has a history of Number Two misfiring and now another cylinder might be misfiring so that could mislead so you can see on my fancy scan tool that now number five has the miss now on your do ity s approach you might have to wait a little while and then the PCM will set a p305 well since we've swapped the coil from 2 to 5 and the misfire is now on number five then chances are we've got a bad coil if the misfire went to number three then we know we've got a plug if the misfire stayed on number two then we know we don't have an ignition problem we have to look elsewhere now I have a known good coil here so let's see what happens now as you can see now our live misfire data indicates no misfire the way you'd be able to tell obviously would be to clear the coat again drive the truck and see if the light goes back on I kind of wish I had a cheapy scin tool so I could kind of do it the average Joe way which I mean it's the same thing you know get your code do the same test I did and do it again the only difference is you won't have the live data but it would really wouldn't matter you would see the code change from 302 to 305 you wouldn't have to you know have the fancy scan tool to do that okay so if you swapped two and five coils and two and three plugs if there was still a misfire on number two and it still set a p302 well you've ruled out ignition your next step is going to be to check compression but that's for another video oh I do have to add something else something else that I've seen personally if the plugs are worn meaning you know they've got even over 100,000 mil on them you could be setting random misfires in any of the cylinders you could have I don't know a shitty plug on number five keeps intermittently misfiring and a bad coil on number two intermittently misfires and it might not necessarily throw a 32 and 305 it it'll probably just throw a 300 which 300 is just a multi-cylinder miss so hope this shows you guys you know how to try to troubles suit these trucks by yourself like I said a couple hand tools in a code reader goes a long way um I know people on The Forum who have done the coil swapping and plug swapping drove the truck back back to Auto Zone and had the Cod rad you know you can do that too nothing wrong with that you just don't want to drive it with the check engine light flashing you can risk burning up the catalytic converter which is money so yeah and a big shout out to my boy Bill AKA Christy's dad for donating this known bad coil he was able to I think he did it the same way he just did some coil swapping and you know he determined that the number two coil is bad or number three I can't remember which one it was so thanks to you sir and uh I guess the other thing is there's there's no way to test this you can't test this outside the truck it just it's not going to happen what you doing I'm going to try to make my truck misfire why you going do that I'll tell you why because no be God sorry"

        "transcript": "did not recently know about this jailbreak so today I'm going to show you guys how to jailbreak your iPod Touch 2nd generation or third generation and see model iOS 4.2.1 using green poison [Music] alright guys so let's get on with this tutorial so the first thing you guys are gonna need to do is open up iTunes on your computer now this can be on Mac or Windows but what you want to make sure of is that your device is connected to the computer via USB now are you going to need to do is back your device up to your computer and then restore then after that restore from that backup you should have everything on there as you did before but it'll be a clean restore of iOS but you will still have everything as you did back before it was like that so anyway the developer has said he took uh he has said that it does fix things and it is a lot better a lot less buggy err if you do that but anyway let's get on with this tutorial alright guys so the next thing you guys have to do is download the green poison application for Mac which we available in the description below green poison the website the official website is down right now for now for some reason I don't know why but after you're done downloading that extract to wherever on your Mac then open up finder and search for green poison right click on green poison as soon as you find it and then press show package contents instead of open so not open show package contents now after that double click on the contents folder then double click on Mac OS then double click on green poison this will open up a terminal shell window also opening up the application that we need to jailbreak so it's going to ask us if we're drinking an Apple TV today so for this tutorial I'm going to say no because we are not jailbreaking our Apple TV and now we want to make sure our device is connected via USB we also want make sure we turn our device off and we are ready to start jailbreaking now the next step in the jailbreaking process is putting your iDevice into DFU mode so all you have to do is press the sleep button for 3 seconds so 3 2 1 then continue holding the sleep button and press the hold button of the home button for 10 seconds so 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 and now release the sleep button and continue holding the home button for additional 10 seconds now after this happens just keep holding the home button and you should see the jailbreaking icon you should see a white screen pop up on your device this is how you know it's working alright guys so now this is the white screen I was talking about so it'll be on here for a little while but then there's nothing to worry about it might look like it's crashing but it will crash back to these lines of code as you can see and this is all of the code now this is what we really want now we're going to matrix mode here so do not let go of the home button until you see the Apple logo that is very vital so keep holding the home button throughout this matrix line of code I guess you could say ish process because it will not actually continue through unless you press the home button I know it's weird but that is the only way it will continue through as I have found so just keep pressing the home button until you see the Apple logo until all this white texts with the back with a black background goes away and then after that you should be okay you alright guys so now this is the step where we see it actually working here's the Apple logo into the green poison logo this guys is how you know it's working correctly and it will boot up jailbroken you and we are back up at the normal lockscreen as you guys can see so let's slide to unlock this did take quite a while the other the booting so I spent that up at anyway slot swipe to the right and there you go guys there is the new loader icon that was just put on our device so this is where we go to install Cydia guys so all we're gonna do is tap on this icon as you guys can see and now it's going to bring up it's gonna say loading sources and here is where we install Cydia so all we have to do is tap on that right now as you guys can see through our about tap on that and as you guys can see as soon as we tap on that it's gonna say gonna come up with two options install Cydia or cancel so I'm going to press install Cydia right now as you can see now it's going to press downloading I did not have to speed this up because it actually took not that long so it's downloading its 3738 and it says the percentage it's extracting and it will say success pretty soon but it's still extracting and here we go success so now what you guys need to get do is go into options and then tap remove loader app but I'm not gonna do that right now and backing out of the application you will see actually mason automatically spring take effect as you guys can see and so after we we spring our iPod or whatever we're using will be backup and we all have Cydia fully working on iOS 4.2.1 alright guys and here it is so slide to unlock swipe to the right once open up cydia and it will do it's initializing filesystem dance so I somewhat lied about that sorry this is the last step before we actually get Cydia to work fully so this is the initializing filesystem dance the city always does so basically it's basically downloading all these packages and sources from repos whatever you want to call them from the internet is to restring your device applying the magic as you can see it's done the boots so we're going to slide to unlock swipe to the right once and before we do that I'm just gonna remove loader it's not required you don't have to but it's recommended that you do that in case you mess anything up you want to make sure just in case you remove that so options remove loader app and we will do that right now I'll show you that it takes effect immediately so we'll back out of the application as you can see now we aren't it's not recognizing my swipes so that means it's taking effect immediately and it's respring my device and its backup as you guys can see and hear is Cydia and there is no loader that is the only icon that is there so there's no more loader app so anyway I tap on Cydia and now it brings up the whoareyou screen so this is the user hacker and developer screen I'm going to tap user and press done and here you guys can see it will display a message that says that this version of city has unsupported this is because this version of city is a long this one is from a long time ago so now it will actually ask you to update to like one point one point nine which is the new Cydia and suruc actually I'll give him a lot of credit he actually went back and got this working on devices all the way from iOS 3 - all the way up to the current iOS 7 so thumbs up for that but anyway so this is what it will look like so we'll come up with a saying that but anyway if you top options it says city in star copyright 2008 2010 J Freeman also gonna circle but anyway here's all the sources searches all that but anyway thanks for watching guys make sure to rate like comment subscribe and favorite this video that is all for now guys this is David

type of video join me as i cap in armic camp down my top favorite adventure time episodes of season one i don't think i need to make a disclaimer that this type of video was heavily opinionated but i'll do it anyway this type of video was heavily opinionated there i did it still gonna get hate comments come on brother we're just trying to beat the heat yeah there's a big sleepy lava man in our front yard and he is so hot number five prisoners of love this episode marks the introduction of the ice king i mainly love how this episode acquaints us with his messed up mentality you don't understand i collect princesses because i want to marry one well why'd you capture six of them if you just want to marry one it's not like he wants to be an abusive controlling husband he legitimately wants to treat these princesses right it's just he doesn't know how as far as he knows kidnapping and threatening girls are sure sure-fire way to start intimate relationships and it's hilarious to see him think that actually it's kind of sad and disturbing when you think about it i also love these princesses oh they're so cute except you i don't like you but look at wild berry prince is jumping around and look at raggedy princesses sorry number four evicted here's another episode that introduces a character i'm marceline the vampire queen marcy even though she doesn't have the biggest role in this episode is still pretty cool she's all like get out of my house and finn's like no son and jake's like finn stop then mercy gives spin unwanted affection but finn doesn't take it a trial because he's too busy fighting for civil rights and mossy's like yeah we cool now oh yeah and the house hunting song is really fun and catchy it makes the montage of the episode quite entertaining and fought that sexy vampire lady you know who really deserves to be in jail i will show you the true jerks number three what have you done in other words ice king reenacts gideon versus wainwright that that was a government joke you you might not get that but yeah ice king gets thrown in jail without access to a lawyer and finn and jake don't even know what he did wrong he just throw him in jail because little miss ping booty said so there are quite a few things i like with this episode first of all i enjoy seeing how ice king proves his innocence yet finn and jake still don't want to let him go because they don't know their judicial system you have disrupted that order for are you ready for this i have committed no recent crime i also love the flashback that explains why ice king was arrested please i beseech your aide in the name of common decency so let me get this straight you're hitting on me i found that to be quite humorous i also love how we venture deeper into the ice king's sad existence and how he's so desperate for friends but most of all i love how emotionally extreme princess bubblegum is in this episode no i need more time what have you done calm your booty please what hey finn you thinking about how that guy's bow tie sort of looked like a bra huh no number two henchman oh hey another marceline episode one of the reasons i enjoy this episode so much is that it establishes marceline as a recurring character when i saw evicted for the first time i honestly thought she was a one-off but no there she is one can predict the plot of this episode from a mile away marcy messes with finn finn misinterprets marcy's intentions rinse and repeat but i don't think i enjoy the episode for the plot but rather the friendship bond that finn and marcy develop over the episode and it makes marcy come across as more of a likable character back in evicted she was just an antagonist who you didn't hate this episode she's more of an antagonist that you actually kind of like and i really love how this episode was able to pull that off marceline is not how she seems she's a radical dame who likes to play games it's hopeless to try stopping a thief here everyone steals from each other it's real ridiculous penny number one city of thieves penny mother lovin penny penny makes this episode great i mean yeah jake's tendency to want to steal is quite humorous and finn taking action by becoming one with the thief in order to catch a thief is pretty cool but penny this girl is boss i love how innocent she appears to be in the beginning i love how big of a jerk she becomes after accomplishing her goal i love how finn and jake are all like penny's good now except she's not penny is supreme why the heck hasn't she come back yet tiffany came back king worm came back billy came back oh yeah but seriously this girl needs to make a comeback sooner or later preferably sooner or uh have some knife in your neck well that's it for my top 5 episodes of adventure time's first season let me know if you like this type of video and if i should do more it'd be greatly appreciated and if you think my list has the worst episode pics in all of existence have some knife in your neck that's fine after all i'm just one opinion on the internet"

        "transcript": "[Music] hello drinks tube I'm Luca and you know I'm Italian I'm crazy about wine I'm crazy about artisan wine and I'm here today to introduce you to how wine is made I'm in Italy within Italy I'm actually in the Veneto region in the outskirts of Verona in the western part right in the heart of the Valpolicella Classico I'm Italian and I obviously considered Italian wines the best but wherever you are whatever the wine comes from let it be California Australia New Zealand friends the winemaking doesn't change and I'm gonna guide you through every single step of the winemaking from the grape growing obedient all the way to the tasting the amazing world of wine doesn't begin in the cellar but it begins in the vania it begins from a vine and the most important thing to set the identity of a wine is the terroir where the vine is planted on to terroir what a big world but in reality that were only means the soil on which a vine explanted for example in this case the vineyard is very very close to the seaside as you can see and before even tasting the wine from this vineyard I will know already for a fact that the wine will have a very strong character a very salty finish also because being so close to the seaside it means that the terroir is very reaching sea like debris and foxes that for very fine salty minerals will be absorbed by the roof and it will be the level into the grapes which inevitably will end up in the taste of the wine whatever the terroir whatever the vineyards have springtime kicks in and soon after the grapes are ready to be harvested but how does they produce a know when it's time to harvest basically it will daily check the amount of sugar contained within the juice of the grapes because he has to make sure that that amount of sugar is right for the alcohol level of the wine that he wants to produce grapes then will be brought back to the cellar and they will have to go through the one of the most crucial and critical stage of the winemaking that be stemming and the crushing of the grapes and it all happens by using machines like this one the pigeon deer as Patricia and now pure power onto really one of the greatest our own a producer will introduce of how this machine works the machine it is very simple when arrived the grapes we put inside here and thanks to this cylinder they this time go harder and the Crave's go down here we have tools both cylinder that crushing the grave but it isn't a rubber so it is very very very soft like the feet and then the freshly crushed grapes gets burned into fermenting tanks like this where the magic of the alcoholic fermentation happens thanks to the east they transform the sugar in a coal and gas and that is a colic fermentation the correct orientation will last between five to seven days for the white for color we remove the skin with it in a day yes because the color is contained within a skin the longer we leave the skin immolation with the wine the more Bitburg the color will be as water fact for red wine the maceration normally lasts from two weeks all the way to two months for there in the between a called fermentation is finished skins remove the wine now is ready for the refining stage which can be instead as a tank or in food battle like here wood is extremely important because through its pores some small quantity of oxygen will get in contact with the wine creating an oxidation some foods have a tighter pores some foods have news reports the four there will be a different kinds of oxidation and this will definitely change the taste of the wine the vast majority producer will use barrels made but I use four type of food hog cherry chestnut and my brain four types of food which will deliver four different style of flavors which their power has a very capable and talented orchestra maestro will then at the end of the aging process will blend them together for a mega Superfly expect that with an example of wine so also for ancient balance the size we need to blend this all is called Babic the smaller the faster the aging simply because there is a greater surface area per volume of wine the fool you have more pores oxygenating the wine that is great for the big stronger wine like Cabernet and Merlot this is for more wines like nebula or vena or sangiovese all is left to do is to be bottled if the wine is aged in oak then it will be transferred again in a stainless steel tank for natural decanting and after that the wine will be bought so now what is left to do once the wine is bottle is to open the bottle and enjoy the final product it's been a long journey and a very delicate process but worth wait and work the stress amazing drinks tube this is the end of our journey this is the end of how wine is made but this was all about still wine if you want to know our sparkling wine is made if you want to know how procedures made just click here but remember whatever you do whatever you like
