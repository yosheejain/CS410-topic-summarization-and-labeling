        "transcript": "uh my name is uh al faksar dita undongo come from kaha west i'm 23 years old and i'm a student of economics virtual economics and statistics in western nairobi my last year why did you start and decide to take agriculture first of all i was brought up in a farming family so i understood the rules of the game but also i realized it's a huge market because people have to eat and population is increasing so that's the market by itself so i thought you would never go wrong with farming so that's why i decided to take farming and try out whether i could do it as a business investment maybe you can believe us on what activities takes place in your farm i have poultry so both layers and energy and boilers so there is a frequent feeding and watering of the poultry buds then i do horticulture that is more vegetables i do spinach managua and more vegetables therefore there is frequent tweeting frequent digging frequent watering when there is no rain frequent change of manure and addition of manure and there is also a lot of manure mixing in terms of the cow manure and and also the manure from the chicken you have mentioned about the cow so that you own a cow yeah i own a cow another two cows but one of them is the one that is being milked the other one is still young yeah so i get around 12 liters per day of milk wow yeah so why did you decide to die fast far in agriculture rather than concentrating on portland or dairy or fruits and vegetables yeah i think the secret behind agriculture is you can't really specialize on one thing if you are a farmer you need to diversify one for the sake of the margins and second of all for the sake of the risk being involved because some of the products are have quick money others will take long so to ensure that you have cash flow then that you are able to sustain the farm then you need to diversify at least and get money that is quick and also some products that give you money after quite some long time do you make money in agriculture yes i do i don't think i i'm yet there i still feel like i'm doing very little so but at least i'm doing something i'm getting something out of it so what do you use the money for first of all i've been paying my school fees since the word go since when i was in first year and my school fees is expensive it's around 83 000 per semester so i've been paying my school fees and most of my money right now is going back into the business and nothing much in terms of investment other places because i want to really bring up the farm to a position where it can stand on its own and so then therefore you need to be very disciplined in terms of applying back your profits to get more more stuff going on one key challenge for young farmers is access to land how did you access your lard to farm at least for me i've used what my parents have in terms of connections and in terms of the family friends because the land that i've leased up there is for a family friend who was not using it yeah i've released land for around ten thousand per year which is two because there are two pieces of land it's around around half an acre each so that's like twenty thousand per year for three years probably they'll renew their contract after that what are the challenges you face as a young farmer challenges first of all is the market i have the market yes but i still want more market because some very big farmers are flooding the market like the son of kinata jamba who is doing serious farming has flooded the market like so many things so you you get that the produce in terms of the price it goes down where else if you're a small farmer then you end up being on the other side of the equation so you might end up not having the market but i'm trying really hard to get markets where i can but one of the challenges is that and also information in terms of the pesticides and what to use and how to take care of your things in the farm you are you mentioned daddy that you're in the mukuriman platforms what benefits have you gotten from it i've learned a lot in terms of various things that people actually post there in terms of one like how much did it cost you to bring up 300 canadian chickens how much it would cost you to do watermelons uh the kind of problem that people are facing in terms of probably insecticides and all those things so i've learned a lot from the platform and also in terms of connecting with people in terms of someone who is somewhere and has a farm and i want to visit i think i've learned a lot from them in terms of them what message do you have for the young farmers or the young men and girls who think that farming is dirty the mistake they have for them is that they we have stomachs to feed in this country and the stomachs are getting more and more every day that means more and more market for farm produce and people are going there and nutritious way of living therefore that means more and more markets for organic produce because people are very cautious about what they eat nowadays and at the end of it all i want to tell them that white collar jobs are not the best way to go but don't get informed you don't know what it entails to be in farming"

        "transcript": "The Reichstag building is a historical edifice\nin Berlin, Germany, constructed to house the Imperial Diet, of the German Empire. This\nimposing building houses the Federal German Parliament or \"Bundestag\" and was originally\ncompleted in 1894 to meet the need of the newly-unified German Empire of the Kaisers'\nfor a larger parliamentary building. The Reichstag was intended to resemble a Renaissance palace,\nand its architect, Paul Wallot, dedicated the building to the German people. The Nazi leader Adolf Hitler exploited the\nfire which gutted the Reichstag building in 1933 by blaming the Communists for the arson\nand for attempted revolution. There is good evidence to suggest, however, that his followers\nwere actually responsible and that this was a manufactured crisis. When German reunification\nbecame a reality, the new republic was proclaimed here at midnight on the 2nd October 1990. The Reichstag has undergone considerable restoration\nand alteration. The building is now the second most visited attraction in Germany (after\nthe Cologne Cathedral), not least because the addition of a spectacular glass dome designed\nby the British architect Norman Foster. The large glass dome at the very top of the Reichstag\nhas a 360-degree view of the surrounding Berlin cityscape. The main hall of the parliament\nbelow can also be seen from inside the dome, and natural light from above radiates down\nto the parliament floor. The Reichstag building is well known in the\nart world thanks to Paris-based Bulgarian artist Christo's mammoth 'Wrapped Reichstag'\nproject in 1995. The entire building was swathed in silver cloth for two weeks that summer.\nYou can visit the dome for free but you will need to register online in advance in order\nto do so."

        "transcript": "[silence] [silence] [music] Narrator: When you take a look at Mars, you probably wouldn't think that it looks like a very nice place to live. It's dry, it's dusty, and there's practically no atmosphere. But some scientists think that Mars may have once looked like a much nicer place to live, with a thicker atmosphere, cloudy skies, and possibly even liquid water flowing over the surface. So how do you go from something like this...to something like this? NASA's MAVEN spacecraft will give us a clearer idea of how Mars lost its atmosphere, and scientists think that several processes have had an impact. One of these processes is called \"sputtering,\" where atoms are knocked away from the atmosphere due to impacts from energetic particles. In our solar system, the Sun constantly emits high-energy photons. When one of these photons enters the atmosphere of a planet, it can crash into a molecule, knocking loose an electron and turning it into an ion. Ions by themselves don't do much, but when a magnetic field is nearby, they'll spin around the field, spiraling in the field's direction. Conveniently, the Sun generates a giant magnetic field that is carried by the solar wind. The part of the field that just grazes the planet can easily pick up a bunch of ions and launch them out into space. If the field happens to be in just the right place, however, it might pick up ions and fling them right into the atmosphere at up to a thousand kilometers per second. The ions can then crash into other molecules and fling atoms everywhere like a cue ball in a game of pool. Some of these atoms can be knocked-- or \"sputtered\"--into space, causing atmospheric loss. And over billions of years, this could have caused quite a bit of change, especially since the solar wind may have been more intense early in our solar system's history. Scientists think that all of this may have caused Mars to gradually transform from what may have been a very nice place to live into the dry, dusty world we know today...and MAVEN will study this process and tell us how it really works.

mistaken yes we did that was I think the only set we've done so far yeah well Deja Vu look at that boss doing only one aerial in his short hop snow getting scared blocking anticipating the next one boss is like nuts like those are those things boss thrives off him man he will use your fear against you man you you ever heard of Freddy cougar yeah that well boss he lives on Elm Street okay it's just that real he's in your dreams he's in your a waking thoughts I guess too let me tell you something if boss is in my dreams I'm staying awake that's my man's du that's my man's d off to a good lead right here nice much different story so far than what we saw in Winner's bracket believe it was uh it was 21 though in winners I think it no it was oh wow snow with the dominance man been uh seeing and playing so many SS today and losing track I feel you man it's been a an excellent day look at those rolls from boss that's one of his patented techniques just disrespectful unpredictable rolls that it's like why would somebody roll there but boss is like no I actually know exactly what I'm doing oh wow with the neutral a the boldness of this man I like it a lot not going to get the kill but definitely making boss think once or twice about how he's going to come back to his stage who just goes off stage with Fox like that bravery right there sow does this man is just not scared anything o cuts his head off with that side B Fox illusion boss at the edge he's got to get up oh snow seeming like he had the read but not the timing not quite okay knocks him off let's see what's good oh just swinging a little too early with that kill shot boss has to watch himself wow look at snow he just doesn't care look I'm tell look snow is just Fearless man in high school this kid walked now the hall no Hall Pass okay he was that bold all right I'm telling you oh and the gentleman kill Luigi B none of it though let me see that Hall Pass real Quick's like get your out my face Bo my man snow is on fire right now this kid fix going to go to detention right now talk to him all right double faes nice string right there he's getting to the chopper he is get to the chopper get out of here Jabs grabs all right okay boss reading the wake up attack nice oh put him in that ground all right Z do highlight real Coming Back featuring boss real quick nice back air yeah that side be not even safe on hit nope if he were at a higher percent he would have popped him away enough but oh going for the hardest of reads right now no Luigi's love that oh but get something off of that fire right there there IGI missile doing his thing back here back throw excuse me that's the classic with IGI man to the fireball oh I got a shield no why not Luigi gets a lot of reward off grabs in this game oo boss looking real sof that will the N the N how do you pop a n like that it's insane all right good stuff boss uh looking to remedy that loss he took earlier in winners Brack and that was a really strong performance I want to say game one yes it definitely was it was looking pretty shaky at first you know could have gone either way but boss just pulling ahead very strong to end and we're going to Omega polutan is Temple okay now I think uh your region tends to like this stage a lot maybe because it has the same color palette as smashville perhaps so that hey that's actually a good obser very astute observation word the day real quick had to get that in one good time and this is definitely a stage uh snow favors a lot we didn't see him use it obviously in winners cuz two a bosss but we are seeing it right now I like Snow's style of just trying to wall Luigi out with hit boxes meanwhile boss just able to get in there he must know the patterns that snow is going for offensively and defensively here I say he's pretty well aware of that oh and illusion just slightly Invincible at the beginning able to cut through the fireball saving snow a couple damage there gets him back into the stage control position but now boss turning it around okay uptil just finding something is that good patient for snow wow shooting these Point Blank lasers man you know the thing about that is he does it because you don't expect it that and Luigi also doesn't really have the Run speed to get he's not fast enough yeah yeah however if boss starts catching onto that he gets a free tornado true okay down thrown there but not enough to kill that move lost a lot of its kill power but it's like the fact that you can combo it in yeah it's crazy that it actually just leads to death if you hit it oh nicely done why that was insane that up smash boss that Focus right now on this man's face I don't even think he's blunk yet uh blink yet blun I know charging up the side B snow just not showing any of that Brazen Edge guarding he knows that Luigi's up B if it catches the weak hit and you're not in your double jump that could spell death especially for a fast baller just doesn't want to risk it and catching himing blood not letting anything get past this man the gatekeeper right now he can sense the fear in snow he's like all right Winner's bracket boss a little sleep though little sleep oh but he's definitely going to wake up H get hits with that up smash my goodness all right snow is still definitely in this thing only 6% separating these two right now we both know foxy is capable of making the comeback oh but is going to be taking for matches like that not the way to do it boss putting up that wall of hit boxes between snow and the ledge or I'm sorry in the center of the stage he knows he just has to maintain control fox has the percent disadvantage needs to come into Luigi and that's honestly where Luigi thrives the most I'm telling you man the Great Wall of Boss okay it ain't made a brick that's fried chicken get there that's an edible house man that do sound very smart hey hey I'm telling you it would scare me off it just look too obvious it's a little too good to be true little too good to be true yes sir okay the point blank Fireball both these guys just shooting projectiles oh wow and snow hanging in there my goodness at 134 this man does not want to go down okay runs up for the grab no choice in that matter yep boss takes it a nice bit of Revenge there Returns the 2 good stuff from boss you can have this back it's a REI there you go man it's that's like the ultimate Grime move in a secret santa it's like you just pass the same person that gift back the not to be unappreciative or anything I'm guilty of that hope my cousins ain't watching"

        "transcript": "what's going on guys this is eix I want to make a quick video just showing you guys a great tool into making some gold with Jewel crafting this is specifically uh prospecting actually but basically if you have seen my other videos with me doing some prospecting on some old school um ore you definitely know that you can make a ton of gold doing this this is just a basically a tool to show you how much profit you'll make with different kind of ores so basically head over to wow prospector off here you're going to pick either EU or us um and then this is all the realm list so they're in alphabetical order so just head over to your realm I'm on illin and I'm on The Horde side so we'll switch that over so as you guys can see this is the big main page here you can bookmark this if you want this does update about every hour um so the information is pretty accurate I mean it's not real time so it's not perfect but for the most part it's pretty damn accurate now to start it off you look at the list here stuff with a green check mark equals good red x equals bad um so with the green check marks you're going to make gold you're going to make profit and with the X's you're going to lose gold so don't even touch those um so as you guys can see it's saying with Adamantite ore we're going to make 95 gold profit per stack um if you buy it off the auction house serite ore 58 gold profit per stack so I'm just going to show you guys um how it works here so Adam anti or where can make a 95 gold that's assuming the stacks are it's four gold we'll we'll round this off to four gold uh each ore so that's about 80 gold a stack so if we're going to buy that's about what it's going for on my auction house right now too cuz this updated not too long ago so let's say it's 80 gold a stack on my auction house um assuming we're going to prospect it at that price we're going to still make 96 gold per stack so what's cool about this is you can change the prices so for example with the gems here um telesight is not going to go for 100 gold a stack or 100 gold each that's way too high realistically it's going to go for probably about 35 gold so you can switch that over and as you can see the profit goes a little bit down just because for whatever reason somebody had it posted at 100 gold per so keep that in mind guys it's this information is based off of what's currently posted on your auction house so especially with the adanti ore it may show you you know 2.5 gold for it when really you look on the auction house and it's going for more like 4.5 or 4.0 I mean if somebody undercuts it's going to throw off the prices quite a bit so just before you go ahead and plug in these numbers check your profits definitely just head over to the auction house see what the ore is going for that's the most important part the gems I mean you can wiggle you can wiggle around with a bit with that sell them for a little bit less a little bit more The Ore is important though so definitely check up on that and what's cool about this so this is assuming we're going to buy it off the auction house 86 gold profit um what's cool about this is if you have a friend or somebody who is farming The Ore for you let's say they're selling it to here for half price let's say two gold each that's 40 gold per stack that's half the gold it would cost to buy off the auction house so hit that and it doubled The Profit to 126 gold per stack now obviously that's the way to go if you got a friend who can do it but it's pretty cool cuz no matter what you're paying for each for the stacks of ore no matter what you want to sell your gems for it's pretty damn accurate um so and this takes into account the cost of the or as well so this is just pure profit here the 126 gold is the gold you're making uh out of the mailbox you know total profit um as you guys can see this tool is super powerful definitely you know pick it up it's free obviously um just head over to the website but you know you can see how good ore is doing like the seranite and the Adamantite is doing really well um other ores like titanium and pyate not so good lose about 300 gold a stack that's terrible um but I mean if you guys want to farm the ore yourself too I mean you're just making even more gold like let's see how much we can make if we got the ore for free let's say we farmed it ourselves zero gold 166 gold per stack and just profit of prospecting it like that's crazy so definitely I mean if you can do some Ora farming that's the route to go but if you're paying you know full price full auction house price you're still making 85 gold a stack I mean you can't complain about that you can Prospect a full stack in like less than 10 seconds I mean you can make thousands of golden hour doing this just keep in mind guys you don't want to flood the market with a shitload of the same gems I mean you can only do so much at a Manti maybe like you know 50 60 stacks and your gems just aren't going to keep selling I mean there's only so much people are going to buy um I mean Jewel Crafters need to level up their professions and all that but I mean it's not going to make you that much because there's a point where you're just not going to sell anymore so I mean once you kind of cap out you know move on to a different one move down to serite because they're different gems so I mean you could be making more gems with that selling more stuff um for you loby guys with really low Jewel crafting copper ore I'm pretty sure you can just do that right out the gate with like level one and uh Jewel crafting as far as I know and 10 not too far off so I mean even as a lowlevel definitely room to make some gold here and uh I mean these lowle gems guys they sell quite a bit I mean personally I'm way too lazy to go farm them when I was leveling up jeel crafting I know a lot of people just don't have time to be out there farming and prospecting all kinds of ore and crap farming it themselves they just want to buy it off the auction house get the jeel crafting Max up to 600 and you know be on with their whatever they're doing with it so as you guys can see this tool is super powerful um if you're into the prospecting or you want to start this definitely check this website out like I said links in the description and uh you know credit to you know Phil squared whoever that is whoever made the website I mean this is amazing tool definitely definitely helps anyways guys that's about it if this helped you out in the least bit uh go ahead and drop a comment and subscribe if you're not [Music] already"

        "transcript": "hey guys what is going on this Joe from guns and pic and today I am playing some 1.9 pre-release yep you heard it you heard it here if you haven't heard it anywhere else yeah that was weird but okay um yeah Jeb just posted this on his Twitter I don't think just but he posted this on his Twitter the like go ahead play play with it whatever just like 1.8 pre-release and I am in an NPC village with NPC people and I've been here for a good long while I would say and I would say one thing these people are very  and ugly ass looking they they look like a I don't I don't even know they don't do nothing when I attack them their name is test efficient if I just pronounce it test yeah see he does not not he does not do nothing I think there's more than one uh type of civilization out there going be the smart ones and I think I'm in the  civilization right now cuz check this out just just tell me leave a comment down below if you think there the civilization I had to build sand to get up to that door okay um there's obviously no other way to get up there so yeah no other way unless you do that but besides that there's no other entrance up here and I already killed this guy and he somehow magically respawned when I kill one of their own people they do not do  so yeah sadly I mean I found the only civilization I found so far is a  one and that is working out too good and I should make some bread and I don't have any wood oh I can just Jack some of theirs um so yeah um I've only found lily pads which are pretty weird looking they like just start floa they you could they can you can only find them in swamps which is pretty cool um yeah uh this civilization of course like I I'm showing you he just looks so look at his unibrow he looks like a piece of looks like a pink turd walking around I'm sad I'm not sad that's sad let me just Jack all the stuff there should be like a a castle civilization like where the king and stuff like that you know how cool that would be and if you want to take over the castle you just go uh you try to yeah so I'm just guessing that they don't really care if I jack all their stuff obviously they're not so hopefully this is smartest civilization I realized hey Gio's taking our let's go fight him so yeah um yeah this is a weird NPC village a one with people and I should take probably take my workbench huh oh I missed uh so yeah um this is not a fake there's a lot of videos out there already showing you that they have 1.9 already oh and I hear a zombie uh what else what else you know what you guys I'll be right back let me go to creative mode so I can show you all the new that's from 1.9 all right be right back okay guys I'm back and I have something to show you guys um if I can fall there we go this is a nether dungeon apparently and these this is nether brick and that is nether fence and there are new mobs in here like that that slime right there fire slime do you see it yeah you saw it um apparently jumps and there's the other one over there spinning like he's yellow like the Cheeto man shoots at you Fireballs but since I'm indestructible right now um they cannot hurt me but um they in this in these type of dungeons there are some spawners and they only spawn uh those the ones that were spinning and shoot fireballs and you can actually see a slime right here this is pretty cool right and I think there's like a lava heart in the middle if we need jumps if you can see yeah and when you kill them it splits them to small ones wow and what do I get no slime balls really nope um so yeah this is like uh this is really cool I can't wait for one uh 1.9 this is going to be freaking cool oh snap there's more of them oh you fell oh my God that is a huge ass one whoa they come in very shapes and sizes yeah I guess when you come in the nether now you have to become even more prepared than you were I recommend making a second house just down there in the nether just in case yeah and I was going through these dungeons for quite a while and they're very big they're they're really unbeliev unbelievably big you will get lost I'm telling you this right now you will get lost yeah they you actually have to go search for them too I to I just started flying around and I like whoa what is that oh my God it's nether brick so yeah um as you can tell that's the nether fences if I I think I could spawn them Yep they're right here and here are the new type of things here is a nether wal wart I have no idea what that does I don't think you can plant them let's see if I go in nether nope I don't know how to plant them and I have no idea what this gold thing is it has no name and I know there's something else in here if I can find it um oh yeah these two things a blaze rod and a gas tier I have no idea what these two do uh this is the things that um Cheeto thing look we're holding and yeah um I I don't know what it does so far something's shooting at um so yeah that's mainly it in the nether I'm guessing but besides that you're going to have a lot of doing Minecraft [Applause] nowes oh I think I know what this does oh never mind okay I killed him uh so yeah that's that's a lot to do in the nether now instead of just coming here for glow stone or Netherrack um what happens when I dig up here's the void for those who didn't know what the void looked like whoa I can still go up that's weird but yeah um yeah that was the dungeon with uh with nether rack another brick uh and nether fences and the new two mobs so yeah um I'm looking forward to 1.9 and for sure we're going to do a 1.9 review when it comes out talk to you guys next time this was Gio from gun and pck and peace"

sorry which just popped up there it's two thousand by two thousand pixels with a three hundred dpi resolution and the brush settings is literally shaped dynamics with a pen pressure and that is all I'm using so this is these are my bits of reference I'm showing you now skull bones and a rose and I just picked up these on line and what I'm going to do is I'm just gonna stick a layer mask on the on the skull and just kind of rub out around the edges if you want more in-depth you know exact ways of power dose you're not ready to use in Photoshop let me know and I can do a video on that as well if you want but a layer mask just means you can kind of raise areas using a brush without actually erasing them you can go back and draw over and then it comes back and say yeah let me know if you need if you want to know about that and I can kind of do that as well but for now basically I'm turning the opacity down I've got a bit I've got some bread I'm drawing in the back of the skull I like to sketch and red so when I go over it with a black line work I can still see what I've done clearly so I'm just gonna do the same thing with the bones I'm gonna just arrays rounds the sort of areas where I don't want to get rid of the right and then I'm just gonna use the magic one tool to get rid of those white areas and put on a black background just so I can see it a bit better so good thing about Photoshop for doing Terry designs like this is you can layer stuff up which when you're making a composition with lots of different elements that's really handy so I've separated the bones out into two separate layers one in front of the other and they're both behind the skull now what we can do is just fill in a bit of white there so they didn't show through the back of the skull and just kind of play about with them that's the good thing about it you don't have to kind of sketch in a bone and bielice kind of in the wrong place and then rub out and draw a new one you can just move them about until they're in the right place you know scale them however you want and you know once you see I'll put the other one in then the other one didn't look quite right so then I move back and move the other one that's the great thing about you can get your comps like right your first time and say yeah just sticking the rows in same thing stick a layer mask on it and erase the edges as you can see it's coming together quite nicely already I mean it looks like crap but it's just composition like that you're doing it doesn't have to look good at the moment and you know you'll see the finished result at the end just have faith it'll be fine and yeah basically this is literally just basic basic stuff so you've got some in so you know where the shapes are and this is really good for swallows just get photos or swallows and kind of trace around them that's if you want to do more detailed swallows because this design is going to be neo-traditionalist something I wanted to mention there's a big big difference that a lot of you wouldn't realize between traditional and neo-traditional and traditional is really basic the stuff I do in all my videos neo-traditional is what this is going to be and you'll see there's a huge difference between it it's kind of like a modern version of old school but kind of taken to more sort of detailed and illustration each place I guess but yeah this is basically the final thing now you saw me mock-up you just draw a few flames in the background like the one on the left and then the one in the middle is kind of it's got both of them there so you can see how I traced it free you can kind of see on the rows I basically followed all the lines a skull same thing and the bones are literally like exactly the same I just followed the main lines in the piece now I would show you more but this video would have been insanely long if I had actually drawn the whole thing on video but I can do that I can do a time-lapse if you know you start to finish one of these I just have to do it really fast so if you want to see that let me know and you know you'll see all the line work phase in everything and then obviously the one on the right is finished design and like I say it's completely different from the one on the left and I have changed some stuff but essentially it's the same and the thing that is you know the kind of hard part is the technique that's the only bit at which you know you might stumble on a few problems because the composition is fairly easy because you can play about it so easily on Photoshop but the technique is literally you know just get in the line work to look good basically and that does take some practice but as long as you've got a decent composition to work from and you're good with line ways then you'll be fine and line weights and you just go around the sort of main parts of the design so the very outer edges of rows for example and the very outer edge of the skull and the eye sockets and the nose socket interests around the teeth just to kind of accentuate the main features and that will give your line work a lot of fun a lot more than a I don't even know what it's called there's not even a word for it but it just looks good say that's a little tip but let's say I only do that with neo-traditional I don't do it with my traditional stuff because that was a one single line in a lot more basic one thing I've got I actually did this with a graphics tablet all the illustrations sort of line face and I use a Wacom Bamboo and I'll link it in the description below if you want to pick one up they're pretty cheap on Amazon so I'll stick that link in there and you can get one from there so yeah guys I hope that helped and if you have any questions don't forget to stick them in a comment

        "transcript": "I did a video a while ago with problems with being a Booker and that 6 minutes was just not enough to explain the problems involved with reading books there are so many more and that is why I'm here to rant explain and show you guys the pain and joys of reading books people don't understand your excitement for books and they look at you funny and you're just there like maintain your excitement God oh my God oh my God End of Days end of days is here end of days have you read it have you got it it's going to be so good days end days look how pretty it is it's so pretty I get more pen R more raing it's just so nice oh my God it' be so good so good so good where you going or how about when there are two editions of a book and they're both gorgeous and they're both lovely and you want them but you only have enough money for one I don't know which one to get they're both so nice I mean this one's got leel on the cover and this one's got the blood on the cover and both the spines look good may maybe maybe I can just scrun up enough coins to get both of them they are both really pretty oh is that another cover by the way I just really wanted to show off my new book thief it it came this morning and it is my fourth edition of the beautiful Book Thief by Marcus Zac that everyone should read this is now the prime example of what happens when you're a booger I'll take this one thanks beep that comes to [Music] $16 well there's no there's no money in my bank account so my cards are out of the question um do you guys take gift bouches no okay um is there any discount for being a student okay $5 you don't take uh English American bonese I'll be right back money for the poor make show you it's for a very good cause to help in excelling a child's Mind through books any will count preferably $16 to the exact like anything please I'm desperate there you go there's the coins thanks there's my book thank you it's time to get my study on let's do this all right I am just going to put my book there and I will read you once I have finished studying [Music] I need to study I need to study study not reading not reading about Cath and and Levi nope NOP I'm studying study study study like kath is studying at College when she meets Levi God damn it okay come on I'll just do a little bit of Light reading before I have to go to bed [Music] w wow I just I just finished a whole book what what time is it oh my God it's 2 a.m. in the morning another problem with being a Booker is book buying bands and I have probably made so many small comments about how big my book buying bands are and how behind I am on them and how I have so many books but it is also a huge problem that most Bookers face because we there are several problems just inside mentioning to be red PS you are on a book buying band because you have so many books and then a book in a series comes out it's like do I buy this book and open the gateway to buying plenty of other books on my book buying band or do I just sit and wait and the pain that pain of having to let a series go because you can't buy the last book in the series I really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really want to get end of days but I'm on a book buying Ben and this is so goddamn painful but I can't have it or the pain of trying to figure out how to organize your 2B red pile of books I mean like do you do it alphabetically do you do it by color do you just throw them all into a pile and hope for the best do you put put them in order of what you want to read next and continue on like how are you supposed to organize them how even finding space to put your tub red books is hard like you have your bookshelf with all the books you've read on them and they're all organized beautifully and then you have this mess of books that are just sitting there and you're like does it go in with all my two my red books or do I create an extra area for my TB red books and like do you have a spare area for all your TB read books how is it that books simultaneously keep me sane and dve godamn crazy walk it off walk it off what are you guys doing to me I know guys I'm a Booker and I have a lot of problems with my books but at the end of the day I would never ever trade any of those problems in and go into a life without books the worlds that they take you the places you can go because damn reading guys am I right reading for watching this what it is I wouldn't be able to tell you but it's something and you guys watched it you guys just wasted all this time watching it and I'm sorry but that's pretty funny because it's literally just me at my house ranting about books that I don't know why anyway thank you happy reading we have a new member to my family as well which as some of my signups include animals you may have noticed okay guys this is rap He is uh my my brother and sister-in-law's new puppy these are real rescues so we not sure what his breeding is but it looks so sad all the time it's such a grum beautiful thing but it's such a cutie pie say hi Papa hello bye"

        "transcript": "hello so um I'm back finally um and I'm just going to do a bit of a hole I guess um it seems like my voice isn't responding to the screen I don't know hopefully it's not delayed or anything like that with the audio but um so I know I haven't made a video in such a long time and I'm sorry I'm still losing my voice but I'm just going to show you I guess a collective haul since the last time I did one which has been a couple months I haven't been spending too much money because I've actually been saving I'm going to be traveling to Vietnam and Singapore in two three months or something like that at the end of this year just before Christmas and so I've just been saving for that but I have bought a couple new things um I gu just decid this would be one of the first things which I've purchased and this was um just a ripped holy type jumper I'm sure you would seen them in on lot like fashion blogs and everything um and then this one was from valley girl and it was only $20 that's why I bought it because I didn't really want to spend too much money on a um rip jumper I tried finding one in an OP shop but unfortunately I wasn't lucky and I couldn't find any but um you can always try op shots and everything and then I have um two new wish Rings this one's just a cross and it's kind of like a gold brass toned and this one is a turquoise and a silver setting um and you can also just mix the two um gold and silver um and then um Nails I keep forgetting um Nails I'm actually wearing it's a kind of minty green color I was actually going for minty green it's a little bit more of a Kind of fluo Green but it's not too fluro but it's just the by nail and then and then this color is the steel the Limelight in n265 so it's just a really nice kind of greeny color I was actually either looking for a nice baby blue or um kind of like a lime green and it takes about I think three coats or something to get a nice coverage um and then with um candles and everything so um TOA and then this one is in Grace and so this is the box I actually got this one online but you can get candles from like dusk and everything I just love it it helps me study and just stay motivated at night time and it just comes in a little J and it smells really really nice and I think it's like a 36-hour burn time which is a pretty good amount of time for a little candle like that um three new stars of sunnies because I know that most of you are going into winter now but I'm actually just about to head into summer in Australia so I'm really really excited about that because Summer is my favorite time of the year and I've had enough of winter um and that also means I'm going to be finishing my uni semester soon but so I'm loving just aviators and so I've actually ordered a pair of Ray bands this is just a kind of no brand name Brown tint but I've actually got one from Ray bands coming but I think I'll take those ones on holiday with me and then my second favorite pair of sunglasses are the cat ey sunnies so these are really po at the moment I've actually been wearing this one lately it's just the brown tint and I've also got them in the black and these ones are actually from an online store that sent them to me and it's Retro City sunglasses and they're actually really inexpensive I think these ones were like $6.99 and then the black ones were $10 I think $4 more and I'm pretty sure they have free shipping options and everything so if you're looking for a nice pair of winged c eye because I know in Australia it's really difficult to find these ones because my friend saw and fell in love with them and she actually wants a pair and we've been looking around shops in my area and we just can't find anything similar cuz they're either not winged enough or just two winged um just two things from makeup I guess is a red lip pencil and this is from Models prefer and so it's just to line my lips and I also purchased a beauty sponge because I've seen lots of videos about the beauty blender which I think is pretty similar so I thought I'd give it a go but I'm kind of just loving my um makeup brushes at the moment so so I haven't really been using it but so the last thing is clothing so um with shoes I've just bought some boots they're just normal black combat boots um I'm actually hoping that I can turn them down somehow and make them work and wear them like that I'm thinking and maybe destroy them a little bit because they're a little bit too clean right now but then these ones were from bets and then so just a couple more things um this dress was from R girl and it's just a kind of maxi dress inspired it's got a black silk top with a nice chiffon um pastel kind of Dusty pink rose long skirt and it just came with a belt and I think this one was around $15 or something and I think it's just a really nice kind of summery dress which um it just looks really nice by itself or you can wear it out and it'll always look really nice and then I also bought one going out dress the this one was from Asus and it's by the brand Motel so I think you can actually just go get it from the actual brand but you can also get it from Asus and it's just a pearl kind of lined black fitted Jersey dress like so and it just looks really different and unique and then the next dress is from um limited collection so so brand and it's just a kind of Tweed and um Tweed and leather dress but I actually have to get it fitted because it's a little bit too loose around some edges and and then really quickly um forever new I just bought this offthe shoulder bodysuit it's just in a pastel pink I think it looks really nice with kind of long flowy skirts and everything and this was $29.95 on sale and it was an extra 30% off so I got for I think $20.50 or something and then I just bought a couple bikinis for when I go traveling just so that it doesn't matter if I lose them or anything and they're from valley girl and so Val girl has some really nice prints this is just a floral one and that's the top and the bottoms were seven and I think the top was 15 and then I just got another pair of Bottoms in a polka dot um and then just a basic white teas which always work just so you can lay them under sneak jumpers and everything which is here and that was from frle girl for like $4.95 that's it for my I guess my I'm back video of a recent haul I hope you enjoyed and I will see you guys in my next video bye"

        "transcript": "Hey there Assassins, \nit's time for another VideoDex! I'm your ComDev, UbiGabe Let's first talk about the upcoming DLC,\nwhich will contain both multiplayer and single-player content...\nfinally, right? We're offering brand new single-player\ncalled The Da Vinci Disappearance in which Ezio must solve the mystery\nsurrounding the kidnapping of his good friend and personal gadgeteer\nLeonardo Da Vinci. In order to solve the mystery\nand find Leo... Ezio will have to work with \nLeo's assistant, Salai. And visit Lucrzia Borgia in\nall-new locations, including... Belriguardo, a castle in Ferrara\nand the Pythagorean Temple. Being an Acheivement/Trophy hound myself,\nI am delighted to announce that... The Da Vinci Disappearance will come\npacked with 10 new ones, specifically for single-player. So you'll have more opportunities to\npad your gamer-cred with this DLC release. But wait, there's more! hehehe We're putting a new gameplay feature\ninto the Thieves' Hideout. It's a dice game called Hazard that is\nactually from the 16th century. We also have some good news for the\ncompletionists among you, because... The Da Vinci Disappearance come packed\nwith the Harlequin and Officer multiplayer personas. As well as the Helmschmied Drachen armor. We're even going to unlock content\nthat was previously only available in the Collector's Edition:\nTrajan Market and the Aqueduct. And before you pre-orderers and CE\nbuyers get all cranky... Be fair, you've had that content for months!\nLet's let everyone have access to it. You think we're done?\nFar from it Assassins! Because I haven't even gotten to the \nmultiplayer updates,\n0:01:37.159,0:0:39.820\nwhich is our largest update yet! First, Animus Project Update 3.0 will\nintroduce a new map: Alhambra. Alhambra is located in an especially\nlush portion of Spain, and the map balances multi-leveled\noutdoor and indoor areas. If you thought Pienza had a lot of\nnooks and crannies, well... hehe you haven't seen Alhambra yet. Second, we're packing 4 new multiplayer\ncharacters into APU 3.0... The Dama Rossa is a lethal beauty,\na deadly Black Widow spider who kills quickly and quietly... The Knight is an armored brute wielding a\ntitanic greatsword to fell his enemies. The Marquis takes his costume advice from\nThe Mercenary, and his murderous methods as well. Finally, we have The Pariah, who hides\nhis disfigured face behind noble finery... and a porcelain mask. Third, we are pleased to offer two new\nmodes with Animus Project Update 3.0... Escort and Assassinate. Think of Escort as a kind of mobile\nChest Capture where one team attempts... to protect a VIP target from another\nteam, hunting that target. Points are awarded for killing the VIP,\nwith additional points for extra style, and for getting a VIP to their\nassigned destination. Meanwhile, Assassinate charges 6-8 players\nto identify and execute other Templars, who are marked on your compass\nas potential targets. The twist is that you must lock your\ntarget in order to secure your contract in this free-for-all mode. Of course, all of this great DLC does\nnot come without cost, so The Da Vinci Disappearance will run\nyou 800 Microsoft Points or 9.99\u20ac on PS3. The Da Vinci Disappearance is slated for\nrelease on PSN on March 9th, and for Xbox Live on March 8th. See you soon Assassins!"

        "transcript": "well today we're going to show you a do-it-yourself project that you may encounter especially if you're a homeowner and that's putting something into a hole that's right we're going to hanker a post maybe you built a deck put up Cyclone fencing a birdhouse that's what we're going to do even a mailbox post all requires a certain concrete mix and a post hole digger with me is Jeff he's with quickr he's going to help me in fact if you pay attention he'll do most of the work right that's the deal that's the deal that's the deal all right the first thing we do is dig a hole now the hole itself we did with a post hole digger for a birdhouse how deep we want to dig that hole about 24 in okay 24 in so we don't need to go below the frost line for a birdh housee but we would for a deck correct your typical deck's about 30 in so yeah now how about the width um again it's going to be different if you're building a deck or a Cyclone Fence this is a relatively small post how about the width on this hole we have an 8 in hole okay and that'll be enough for a bag of that'll be plenty okay all right yeah and your typical post hole digger or handheld auger is going to give you an 8 inch hole all right all right well should we get started with this particular and by the way I want to ask one more question because I see this tube here I see a lot of these being used especially uh building decks what is this called and do we need it for this project this is called a quick tube and um it can be used for uh above ground where you want the where you want the form to come up and meet the deck post or it can be used in the hole itself make sure that you use the proper amount of concrete and we're not using it for this particular project we don't really need it for for a two 24in hole and a bird house but if you're building a deck good idea good idea all right we'll sit this out of the way all right we got our birdhouse post let's put that one right in the center of the hole itself right in the center now this particular concrete mix this is a fast setting how fast setting is this this is going to give you an initial set in about 10 minutes in about 30 minutes you'll be able to hang the bird house on there really that's pretty fast setting all right I'm going to show you how easy this is that's why we wor our txas today first thing the water goes in the hole water goes in the hole all right and how much water do we need to use there this is about a half gallon and we're just pouring the water and this is a no mix concrete mix right all right all right we just let the water sit in there then we're going to take the fast setting concrete mix and we're going to pour it in directly on top of that yes all right it's no mixing product so all we're going to do is take the concrete pour it in the hole now what happens there Jeff the uh the moisture obviously in the bottom in fact I saw it squirt up it's actually pushing the moisture up into the concrete right when the concrete hits the water it actually just comes up and mixes itself all right and I guess the next thing we got to make sure is it's plum that's pretty fast that's pretty fast so we can get a little twoot level make sure it's plum get our bubble right in the middle there we go we going to add a little water on top put the rest of the water on top there and again that's 30 minutes 30 minutes before you can really add some weight to the top of it okay and that's what we're going to do we're going going to wait our 30 minutes we're going to put our uh our bird house up there it'll look beautiful the birds will enjoy it I'm sure and to be honest with you I kind of enjoyed that project I did sweat a little bit but not much and yes you did do most of the work now the Quick Creek products of course are available wherever quick R products are sold"

        "transcript": "hey folks is Jan here from ultimate our c-calm with a quick review of the Traxxas 1/16 scale Boss 302 Mustang RTR and I call this 1/16 scale but in reality it's actually bigger than that this is closer to a 1/12 scale vehicle the reason that they call it 1/16 scale is just because of the chassis that's based on it was originally the 1/16 scale mini ear Evo to convert it over for on-road use they put the mini slash 4x4 arms on it to make it not as wide then they also changed up the shocks the shocks here are much shorter as ours the spring so it doesn't have nearly as much suspension travel as the original off-road version but it still has way more travel than a standard on-road car now all the electronics on this vehicle are waterproof you've got a waterproof steering servo and waterproof esc and that's a brushed only esc the excel 2.5 it's powering a Titan 12 turn 550 sized brushed motor right out of the 1/10 scales and you've got a water proof receiver box also and that has a very very very tall antenna mast which betrays the 27 megahertz AM receiver that's inside this chassis does have two battery trays and the doors open up from the sides like so you can put two batteries in here but they have to be wired in parallel for more runtime not more speed this does include one battery a twelve hundred million power six cell nickel metal hydride pack and they also do give you a charger although it's just a wall charge or one of those trickle style ones that takes about four to six hours to fully charge the small little battery focusing on the wheels and tires just briefly it uses standard sedan size 1/10 scale on road wheels and tires and the tires that are included here are slicks but they have a medium hard compound to them more designed for longevity than grip the controller is the original Traxxas TQ radio system is the very first radio set that came with my very first hobby-grade RC a long time ago and has this very very very long Olympic fencing class antenna these things hopefully one day will completely go out of style and be replaced by 2.4 gigahertz setups that have very short antennas incidentally if you do get the brushless version of this car it does come with the 2.4 gigahertz radio set this one is just AM to keep the costs as low as possible okay driving time first thing everybody always wants to know about our ready to run RC is how fast does it go well this one is about 19 to 20 miles per hour tops with a freshly charged battery you know I was really expecting more than that given that the off-road our TRS brushed also powered by the exact same motor go faster than that the driving dynamics of this car are very unique for this day and age it has a ton of body roll with that soft suspension and the high center of gravity with the motor mounted way up in the air the tires are kind of a unique thing too because they do have some traction they're not drift tires but they're not full grip tires either on a regular asphalt surface like this you can get into a drift pretty easily and I actually found that to be more fun than just driving around with no body roll and 100% grip all the time for just plain bashing and fun driving purposes that just seemed more interesting to me it is not however optimized it all for driving on a track on a well delineated well-maintained smooth track surface this cars shortcomings were pretty easy to spot the 70% grip 30% drift tires were not consistent in turns however you can fix that by just changing out the tires themselves what that isn't going to fix is all that body roll when the vehicle rolls that much it's not just to the body but the chassis itself it's going and with it it's taking the angle of the wheels and tires or just changing your camber which is just making it perform a little bit on the unpredictable side it has a natural tendency to want to under steer or push interns which you need to counteract by getting on the brakes a little bit once you do that it makes the rear-end want to start to kick out and that's where you start to initiate just a little bit of a drift at that point it's like doing a tightrope walk you have to be very careful with your steering input your corrections as well as your throttle input to try to write it right along that line so it doesn't actually spin out on you it's definitely a challenge but it is a very enjoyable challenge as long as you don't expect this bashing machine to act like an actual racer and that right there is the main thing that I got out of this entire driving and testing and reviewing experience for this vehicle if you want a proper excellent handling on-road track machine do not get this straight up forget about it it has fundamental and major disadvantages that you just cannot overcome by upgrading and customizing it on the flip side though I would not want to take a race tuned on-road sedan onto an off-road track and take it over jumps but see here this is the brilliant thing about the way that this car is set up because the suspension is so soft and has so much travel it can handle bumpy textured surfaces without getting all upset and thrown all around obviously it is not an off-road car but realistically driving surfaces for a bashing on-road car more closely approximating what you're looking at right here then the beautiful on road racing track at NorCal hobbies the same things that make it kind of lazy and a little bit on the unpredictable side here on this well groomed driving surface make it much better than a full-on racing on-road car on a parking lot or just a back road or any sort of asphalt that's not all groomed and prepared and swept and perfectly smooth in short this car has its place and it's out here in parking lot or the cul-de-sac I'm only a little bit iffy about the price because for a little over 200 bucks RTR you can get brushed Edition ready to run full-on one-tenth scale sedan based on Road car that will handle much better than this and for just a little bit more you can get some extra springs and shock oil and tune them up so that they'll be a little bit softer in the suspension and be able to handle bumpier surfaces while also accepting full-sized more standard 7.2 or 7.4 volt battery packs and more common one-tenth scale sized electronics for my money I would definitely get a bigger more standard car but if you're really interested in this car right here and you've seen what your options are and you like what you see in this video I'm not going to try to dissuade you because this is a fun car and in the worst case scenario if you get bored of it you can always change out the wheels and tires and shocks as well as body and then you have a mini slash 4x4 change out the arms shocks body wheels and tires again you've got either a mini ear Evo or a mini summit there are a lot of things you can do with this little chassis and in all it's pretty cool that's all I have to say about this one as always thank you very much for watching and I hope to see you again soon in the next video bye for now"

        "transcript": "welcome to piano studio in this video we are going to demonstrate several of piano studios basic functions by composing a very simple song that may be familiar to you you can follow these same steps by reading the chapter called your first song in the piano studio helping you piano studios interface opens in landscape mode and it's really designed for two-handed use however you can lay it on a table or play it any way that feels comfortable to you we'll begin by adding a new empty song to our song list simply hold the menu button in the upper left corner select songs and press a new song will clear the default name and type in twinkle and then press done now let's add notes to our song using the note editor once again hold the main menu button this time press editor and you will see the note editor including this keyboard view and a number of function buttons along the bottom these buttons are label note or phrase button keyboard scrolling chord select cut copy paste tools under the actions button and the help menu one other button on the right side is the grabber we can use this to move in or hide the editor entirely we use the note editor to add a note or notes to individual buttons the cenotes are labeled with their octave number since they are the first note of each octave for instance the B below C 5 should be B 4 and so on we'll add C 5 to this button notice that the button is automatically labeled C 5 will make the next button a g5 followed by an a5 and then another G 5 now this all seems pretty easy we could have just played these notes on the small keyboard view and editor but look what happens as we start to add chords we'll choose the button first in this row and then open the chord selector from here we can select from thousands of one-handed chords in our library by simply picking parameters from each column for this example we'll start with a basic C 4 major chord we've closed the court selected for a moment and you can see the button is now labeled with a chord name well it's also go one step further and use the keyboard view to add a C 3 to give it a bass note in that same chord the orange button on the side reminds us that there is already other notes assigned to this button that we can't see without scrolling up next let's repeat this with the next button this time we'll put an F 3 major chord and add an extra F 2 for the base on that now this is beginning to sound a bit better we're not done yet let's quickly fill out the second row of buttons with the next line of the song using the same method we did for the first okay here's a chance to show you how the copy/paste feature works I want to put a c4 major chord on the second button since I already have one of these I can just copy it I'll highlight that button tap the actions button and slide my finger to select copy now I can select the blank button tap the actions button again and use paste now before I show you the next type of editor that's the phrase editor I'm going to copy a few more notes to the bottom row of buttons okay now we'll create a simple phrase button for our example phrase buttons can be up to 4 bars long and as complex as you want to make them select the last button and this time tap the icon that looks like a little miniature piano roll notice the button now has angular corners instead of rounded ones to show you it plays a phrase instead of simple notes the first window shows an overview of the phrase in this button which as you can see is empty at the moment so we'll tap the screen and enter the edit mode to begin building a phrase the first thing we'll do is use the phrase editor settings menu to setup the basic parameters of our phrase will want to bars and four beats per bar and one subdivision per beat is fine we won't need it to loop and we'll leave the song tempo at 100 bpm for now okay the phrase editor works much like a simple piano roll style step editor you can just scroll the notes you want interview and tap where you want them to appear if they don't land exactly where you want them to at first you can just drag them to the correct spot if you accidentally add a note that you don't want no problem just tap the bright green X to delete the note that is currently highlighted and drop it a couple of g 5 and F 5 notes into the first bar now drag the second bar interview and add a couple of B five notes and finally a single D five but we want the last note to hold for two beats so we use two fingers to stretch it out you'll also notice that I can change the volume of this note in a similar fashion as I add notes the phrase editor will also use the parameter the last note that I touched this makes it really quick and easy to add a string of notes similar length or volume without needing to edit each one individually"

        "transcript": "hi everyone i'm nathan with the ebookreader.com i wanted to give a quick comparison review between the new fire hd6 here on the left and the kindle fire hdx to the seven inch version so obviously there's a huge difference in size there's also a seven-inch fire hd that they just released this year it's uh closer to the size of this one it's very similar it doesn't have the higher resolution screen that the hdx has anyway it's all kind of confusing but i have a comparison table on my website if you wanted to figure out all the differences between them but i wanted to show this video basically to show the differences between the smallest kindle fire the fire hd6 and the fire the seven inch fires which are a lot more common i mean seven inch tablets have been uh there since the very beginning of android tablets so it's interesting to finally see somebody come out with a six inch version as you can see it's a lot smaller overall we've got like it's at least an inch shorter and an inch wide or a narrower it's probably more like an inch and a quarter narrower at least um their thickness is uh very different just because like the hdx has that really tapered edge and this one has more of a thick edge so i think that the thickness is about the same overall but it feels a lot thinner on the hdx just because of the way the edges are beveled so as far as software goes i'm not entirely sure if amazon's updating the operating system on the hdx or not i mean since they're still offering it i would assume that they would um but right now the fire hdx it has a fire os 3.0 running on it on here right here on the right and the new fire hds have fire os 4.0 um i thought it was kind of funny because on the description for fire os 4.0 amazon says like an entirely visual upgrade but as you can tell i mean they look identical virtually i mean the os is pretty much identical the only thing that's really changed is like the icon see the silk icon browser right there on the left it's totally different than the old icon so the icons are new there's some also some different additional things like smart suspend which is a new feature on the hds that um supposedly help with battery life so as far as that goes let's go ahead and talk some more about the features with these two devices so the six inch version here has a high resolution screen it's 1280x800 for on the six inch screen that works out to 250 dots per inch on the seven inch version here it's got it's this is the hdx so it's got over um 300 i think it's 323 pixels per inch so you got the high resolution screen on the hdx the seven inch version of the hd it has the low resolution screen has the same resolution as a smaller one so it actually loses clarity once you get the bigger screen but as far as comparing these two screens go this is the same book with the same roughly the same font sizes they scale a little bit differently so it's actually one size bigger on here on the left but they look actually about exactly the same size but as you can see so it cuts off right here at the word taking so like that's right here so you're getting that much extra uh screen like reading real estate with the larger seven inch screen so it's really only a couple of sentences like three lines basically but it definitely works out to a lot overall but once you have the smaller device i really like the fire hdx form factor or the fire hd sixes just because you can fit your hand on it around it really good you can still use your thumb for navigation and stuff okay so it doesn't really matter which one you got the software is basically the exact same amount of features on them i mean you got the same exact lists up here with the same exact i mean apps and books and it's the same exact deal i mean it just has a slightly updated software here on the hd i'm not sure if like i said if the hdx is getting the software or not but as far as features go you're getting the same exact thing same exact carousel you got the different hardware differences with the hdx it does have two speakers whereas the um hd here on the left it only has one speaker and the speaker definitely sounds better on the hdx i don't know how well it's gonna translate on the camera here but let me go ahead and give you a quick sound test here with the volume up on both of them so yeah it's definitely quite a bit quieter on the hd just with that one speaker uh the seven inch version the hd has two speakers i noticed on the spec sheet otherwise i think it's pretty much exactly the same these all both have bluetooth and obviously like i said you got a few hardware upgrades with the hdx with the high resolution screen and the additional speakers and it's also got dual band wi-fi where this one has single band wi-fi another thing that i noticed this difference between these two is the touch screen so um that's one thing they did to save money on the hd to get it down to 99 bucks because the hdx is twice as much at 199 is this one only has a two-point touch screen so you can only activate two points on the screen at once where the kindle fires if the hdx just got 10 point capacitive so obviously you got a lot more points of touch on the screen i don't really know how useful that is basically you only use two most the time unless you're using like a piano app like this but uh so as far as that goes they're basically the same one thing you'll notice here is with the new operating system it automatically opens apps in full screen which is nice um so with these old operating system it always put this annoying ugly tab on everything um that you had to slide up it's like totally obvious you have to slide up so i don't know where the tab had to be there so on these newer ones you just have to slide up they got rid of that tab so it definitely looks better as far as the visual aspects go when you're in apps so silk browser is apparently improved with the os 4.0 i really don't notice any differences to be honest with you i don't know if they haven't implemented them yet it said that it had private browsing and stuff but i don't see that option anywhere i do see the option to um print page so on the old hdx you didn't have that print page option which was a new feature you still got the same full screen option a full screen mode works really well on the smaller screen there because you get rid of all the uh bars and everything it looks a lot better with the full screen so you got the full screen on this one too it just doesn't require going into the menu you just have to hit that button right there but i always hated that stupid tab like you see right there it always annoyed me so i'm glad that they got rid of that it's just totally obvious that you swipe up and then you get back to your menu anyway so i don't know why that tab needed to be there so otherwise you got the same features you got the same home screen got the same tab so like i said these two devices very similar obviously it's just some hardware differences between them that separate them so i'm gonna go ahead and wrap up this review right here i just wanted to show you guys outline the main differences between these two obviously the size is the biggest difference and other than that i mean they're basically the same device software-wise so and oh one other thing i forgot to mention the new fire hds they have a rear camera none of the other fire tablets used to have rear cameras so even though this one costs twice as much no rear camera so yeah even the 99 one now has rear cameras so that's definitely a added bonus it takes decent pictures i took a few on here it's nothing spectacular but for uh uh added camera on the device it is kind of nice to have so i'm gonna go ahead and wrap up this review right here check out the ebookrigger.com for some additional information i'm going to be posting full reviews of these devices as well so if you wanted to check out more in depth as far as the software features go i'll be posting full reviews of this device as well"

        "transcript": "last question also related to storage and cheated like a little animal that runs fast it runs really fast nobody does a really fast animal me someone a hard drive that's named cheetah because it is so freakin fast since I recently purchased a cheetah 300 gigabyte 15,000 rpm Drive that that's pretty fast and I want more space so I was thinking about buying another and making a raid a raid 0 configuration would that just be overkill to get a few more gigs and it's from one of our youtube viewers by the way if you are watching our show on youtube know that aren't full videos are actually available on our website so do be sure to check that Aston techies comm aesthetic geez calm that's right because what you find on YouTube only samples of our videos and a lot more you can put up on YouTube okay because they have that 10-minute limit thing and no one likes that we like what we deal with more in-depth topic yeah so anyway question and I want to point out the the drive that he was talking about here's a storage review site you might want to look at if you're looking at the cheetah and it talks about some of the speeds of it but basically most hard drives on a desktop computer are 7200 rpm 7,200 revolutions per minute the laptops are usually 5400 or 4200 you know if you haven't dealt with this for when you buy a computer they always say like you get 120 gigabyte hard drive they'll tell you the speed ask about the speed because it's very important in the performance of your computer how fast that drive is there on the laptop you can't really go beyond 7200 it'll kill your battery and they're always made much smaller so they can't go quite so fast but the Cheetahs are I think they're 2 and 1/2 inch drives and at 15,000 that's double the speed of a typical desktop this saves you time and launching an application you know what slows you down the launching power point it's not your processor the launching time is affected by how fast your hard drive is most of the time mm-hmm and how big the file is it obviously can run faster Adobe streamlines Photoshop and makes it a smaller package to load but it's your hard drive speed it is great idea to have your boot drive your startup drive to be one of these like cheetah drives or one of the other brands that you'll see reviewed in here on this storage review.com site because it can really improve the performance of your computer more than Ram a lot of times now they're also 10,000 rpm drive and that's a good way to go to they are pretty expensive but anyway I digress from the question which he asked about the raid 0 configuration raid0 for those of you who don't know it's basically taking two drives we have a cheetah 300 and Sheeta 300 and he wants even more speed apparently this guy feels like you can never have too much storage or go too far too fast the Ferris Bueller's line I think so how fast do you drive anyway so we've got is it's writing to both the drives at the same time to give you even faster read and write access it's running to both of them so you're getting an added speed boost as a result of nine that is kind of nice but realize if one of those drives fails you've lost half your information he's lost all your information because half your files here at half of it's there if this drive fails you can't recover the data off of the other drive and that's nice thing about RAID one configuration is it makes them a copy my personal feeling is you probably don't need a cheetah 300 gigabyte 15,000 rpm drive for those other gigabytes of files that you've got if you need a few extra gigabytes of storage maybe you should archive some of your files you can compress them with zipping them that's one ways to do it the other way would be to buy an external drive or an extra internal one that's a lot cheaper you don't need to go with that fast because you will pay a couple hundred dollars more for that hard drive for the cheetah than you would for just a standard you know Seagate 7200 rpm right you take an external drive archive it back but if you really do want all that speed yeah you could is it overkill yeah I'd say it's probably overkill to do it that way I don't think the raids gonna give you that much of a speed improvement you've already done a lot of what you can do but if you're serious gamer and you've got huge megabytes of files you're trying to read and write to I know that extra frame per second you make a difference in your success in playing these things so keep that in mind I guess I would say probably you know I would just put probably most of those files that are on that drive you need extra storage not all those needing as fast access move those to a separate Drive that's a little bit slower and you'll save yourself quite a bit of money if you've got a lot of money why not there's got a lot of money click our donate button anyway that's all the questions we have time for today I hope you've enjoyed next week we're gonna show you a way to save you some money speaking of dough and show you how to save anywhere from like 70 to 400 bucks and so you want to definitely tune in next week and you've got got to do I mentioned that they that export that save as save as and making sure your files are cross-platform and cross and cross program now as well as your viewer questions keep them coming that's a big part of what helps this show to keep going is by sending us your viewer questions you help give us the ideas for the content okay for ask the techies I'm Julie beard thanks for tuning in"

        "transcript": "what is going on everyone my name is Eskimo and welcome to the city of dragon Guild now this is a huge city as you guys can see from the map and just here here are a few numbers about the city all right he has the Builder of this map right there medievals he has spent over 7 months creating this map and there are over 900 houses in this map now unfortunately I can't show you every single detail but he I'm going to show you guys the uh part of the city he wanted me to show you guys the part he's most impressed with that he's built because unfortunately I've lagged out like four or five times now from his game and unfortunately uh yeah I I need to get this done as fast as I can and can't show you guys every single thing but here is my favorite part I actually saw this I was like wow this this uh fire around this cauldron is really awesome I really wanted to show you guys this I think it's really cool as you can see uh this uh city as it is it's it's sort of a a bit of a Nordic city or a Skyrim City if you don't know what a Nordic city is you know a northerner city from like a the Viking cities and stuff like that you know it's a bit grand for Viking City I mean it's a bit it really is pretty Grand and he's not done with the map yet I think he says he's still got like four or five months to go something like that this is another one of my favorite features right here this bridge you know just stand in here I might have to add something like this to my let's play world but yeah guys um like I said there's over 900 houses and as you can see the houses aren't small either they're actually pretty big you know I don't know if this is like a commercial District or something like that but all around the city there are uh walls and stuff like that and uh I think this is a bit of a Market District right here yep looks like that and you know this place is pretty cool and um I think in about 4 or five months after upside stairs are introduced he's going to end up finishing the map and um I'm going to add a big castle but as it is you guys can actually add him if you want to see more of the map but this is the town hall right here the Town Center it actually looks pretty cool and uh what I really like about this map that I wanted to talk about is how just randomly around the city there are towers with fire burning them like over there right there right there right there on the town hall so it's definitely pretty cool and stuff that stuff like this that make maps better in my opinion the little things like I don't know this this villager just chilling in here around this waterfall kind of cool but um I don't know if I mentioned this cuz like I said I'm in pretty much a bit of a hurry oh the Tor what I've never what that's awesome that's I've never even seen that before that just blows my mind like the torches on the item block holder thing but uh yeah as you can see the city is absolutely massive and one thing I don't know if I mentioned is that you can actually add him there is his gamertag and I will add it down below in the description so you guys can send him a message um it's just medieval it's pretty simple send him a message like hey man I want to check out your world cuz unfortunately I can't show it all but I wanted to show off this bridge over here as well because you know I thought it was pretty cool how it's like built into the side of the mountain and makes sense as you go up to it it's definitely worlds like this I love showing off so if you guys actually do have worlds like this to show off and hit me up on Xbox my gamertag is right there but um you can always send me a message on YouTube or over Twitter and just be like hey askimo come to my world check it out and you know I will do that I think this is a church H let me go inside is this a church cuz you know I haven't been inside of every single building so unfortunately I haven't seen every little thing because I I really would love to but I keep on lagging out like oh this is a church if I could just find out how to get inside scumbag ass not even knowing how to get inside of buildings okay here we go here we go going inside the church pretty pretty simple church I think it'd be really cool if you had like item dispensers with a book to shoot out for uh for some Bibles you know inside the pews I think that'd be pretty cool to see you know um you know I'm I'm pretty much as it is right now I'm just going around the city showing off as much as I possibly can before I do lag out um I think at that place that's on the Northern left part of the map it's like a port yeah it's like a a bit of a port this is like the main city right over here Market District and there I go I end up lagging out that's unfortunate but I will join back in see are my chunks loaded back up no they are not my chunks are not loaded back up which is very unfortunate guys but stuff like this does happen but yeah guys I've been Eskimo I love you all thank you for checking out the city of dragon's Guild and whenever the map is done though he is going to give me a download link and I will show off the entire map but as it is you can actually send him a message like there it is again medievals send him a message on Xbox and tell him to add you so you can check out this world of dragons Guild but as always guys I have an esimo uh let's see where where is it where is that for fish where is it at H come on where's that fish oh it's on food isn't it come on okay here we go we go we'll go for some cooked fish there you go guys have a fish I love you all and I shall see you next time"
