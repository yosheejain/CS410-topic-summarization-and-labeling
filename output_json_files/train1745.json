        "transcript": "hello YouTube this is r&m productions here with the comparison of the CPS 1,200 and the CPS 1000 um keep in mind that's actually purple not blue it's the same color as that and that it's just showing up funny with the lighting so on this we're going to start by comparing the parts that both of them have and how they're different and the advantages and disadvantages of each one so cap wise they're exactly the same they're both tethered tethered screw on caps yeah um they're different colors but it really doesn't matter from the outside that one's a little darker and on the inside the color is different but it doesn't matter so now to the reservoirs next thing um on the Cs 1,200 the reservoir I wouldn't say much larger but it is uh lot larger than the 1000 signicantly larger um the 1,000 has a I wouldn't say very uh but a small reservoir for a CPS to run you'll be you'll be filling up a lot in the battle I just say that most cps's tend to use up their water pretty quickly though because of the nozzle size and the power it you it takes water away quickly though but on the CPS with less water you it's lighter so it doesn't there's the pr so this one's heavier but it holds more water that one's lighter so it you can run faster but it holds less water yeah so they're still pretty much equal um let's go to the straps here H there isn't much they're both they're both adjustable straps and they're all evenly weighted so there's not much to say there handles um same exact I don't yeah except yours is farther up and it seems a little bit sturdier like that looks a little flimsy it's kind of on the back more yeah yeah that I I think that's a little more to the CPS 1000 so um this one is round though they're pretty much the same yeah so handles um this handle it's grippy it's round but the problem is when you're grabbing this except your hand would be on the other side unless you're a lefty um right here when you hold it around the handle you get a lot of barks and they I wouldn't say they hurt but they kind of hurt they just rub it gets annoying and the tip of your finger it's kind of hard to pull it yeah it's only the very tip when you're but you'll have this gun for forever yeah you'll get used to it if you keep care of it and it's the same thing with the 1000 but I haven't seem to gotten any of those little bumps around there and it's a square this time and it has these rub grips up here the trigger pull is a little longer and it's clicky which is kind of nice um so now we'll go to firing Chambers um we're not totally sure about the yeah we think we know this one's a 625 M yeah and they both use CPS we think this one's 625 it might be 600 though we're not sure but both of them about the same shot time two to three seconds yeah both of them don't have much water for um firing chamber cuz theys weapons you have to be careful with tap shots and such so let's go to pumps grips grips yeah grips when you hold it um they do have kind of I wouldn't say grips but you can't put your hand down here that actually comes with a nice little rubber grip so I'd say that one has a bit of an advantage all through that line there it's like but you might not be holding that too much you might just have your hand on usually you'll have your hand on the pump yes so now to the pumps yeah um the pump handles themselves are almost exactly the same this one a little it's shorter a little bit darker there's more grooves but I would say equal with grip wise so then now let's go to the rest of the pumps yeah when you extend them they're both stick pumps and conveniently but I think some tests have shown that the 1,200 is actually thinner it's not like you can't see that it's thinner but it's more Hollow so it's a little bit flimsier I think well one person claimed that on iso.com I think it was but so they're both sticks pump which is a little inconvenient but the thing is his is really smooth to pump they're both 35 ml I think um but this one sometimes when you're pumping around when you get to around here sometimes it'll catch a little so you have to kind of force it to one side then slide it in and get it around a little niche or whatever so that's that one's in better condition than this one like physical condition all right now we'll go onto the nozzle um both nozzle sizes if I can show you guys are exactly the same you might not um yeah they're exactly they're both 5x nozzles rated by super silker yeah some people claim that actually I don't know about the 1,000 but I've since I've read up a lot on the 1,200 I know it um some people claim that when you start shooting with it the rating is actually a 10x and then throughout the 3 seconds of shot time it drops down to 5x I don't know if that's true but if it is true it's probably true for the 1000 also this one has a little bit more range only about 3 ft though not going to make a tremendous difference but it is a little bit more range the output's the same with 150 M to 250 M and looks wise we seem to agree that that the the CPS 1000 is a better color scheme and it in general looks better um I think the nozzle looks a little bit better on that one than that one but I'm not really sure but overall both guns are great this gun I would say more could be a submachine gun SM which means it's light it's close combat you can get in you can run in it has this one is like the heavier one it stays behind that one and covers him and stuff and makes sure that it has longer range like yeah yeah so all around"

        "transcript": "[Music] so your local Best Buy might have aisle after aisle of electronics but it has nothing on the cornicopia of wacky and wild and Whimsical that you'd find in Japan which of course is the home of gadgets to begin with so here to talk about his recent visit to CAC which is the Japanese giant Convention of all their manufacturers and prototypes and inventors and smart people is Tom Similan from switch.com hey Tom hey what's up how's the jet lag treating you I think I'm better now I've been back about a week but it was pretty pretty brutal yeah was brutal at first but when you know when the gadgets keep me awake so right you know so what does this mean that you're a tech perk well I was on a panel of American thought leaders as they were calling them and basically or they're calling us basically we were asked to go to CCH to look at all of the new stuff there all the new gadgets and pick superlative items things that were really innovative things that maybe had legs and would maybe come to the US in a few years just things that we thought were Innovative Technologies that impressed us okay so what did you see that might come here I mean as as your in your Tech per High what did you choose or the panel choose as terms of cool stuff well probably the thing that I think struck us the most and that we saw having the most legs were super thin flat panel displays so televisions that are super thin so we thinner than your regular panel that you haven't Best Buy we have we have flat panels already but these are flat panels that are less than an inch thick for example the Sony ol display which can be seen on switch.com or a lot of blogs online I mean it's not very big it's it's a very small television only 10 in but it is extremely thin brilliant color and just just looks really really nice now ol is organic LED right yeah organic LED yes exactly and um so it's a new technology that provides a lot more color and is a lot of people people are saying might be take over over LCD you know in the future I mean there were so many different science forare like projects they were showing bracelets that had different like screens on them the wackiest thing the wackiest application of a screen the wackiest application of a screen I think probably the wackiest screen I saw was one that was kind of like a bracelet but it was almost like paper thin kind of a thing you can watch TV but you have to keep on moving your your hand to read the crawl yeah so that that was kind of cool but it wasn't you know it wasn't fully fleshed out again like a lot of these science fair type projects right right gesture-based Computing motion based stuff that was a big thing yeah we saw a couple of interesting interfaces if you will or ways to kind of control computers and other devices that were totally based on how you move your hands and things like that so you know you'll never have to worry about losing your remote control again because everything will be based on gestures you make Toshiba was showing some interesting gesture-based interfaces thanks to a new chip they have called Spurs the Spurs engine it's a new processor they have called the Spurs engine what kind of gestures are these I mean I I get an image of uh Minority Report right well it for now it's still like you have to stand in front of the computer and do very specific gestures like you know thumbs up means yes you know thumbs down means no it's like playing a Thurman no not yet I mean it's not the kind of thing where it's you know catching you as you walk by and analyzing you or you know you can just wave as you're driving by quickly it all you have to be there that we also saw Pioneer also had kind of an interesting uh interface for the car like a control system kind of a GPS that had some kind of motion based elements but I thought they were kind of Superfluous ultimately and I wasn't that interested in that one but it goes to show you that people are trying to get gesture-based controls into all kinds of things not just computers or gaming systems but also into the car so what about robots they're everywhere in Japan at least um or at least they seem to be very excited about robots what's interesting is that Sony has not given up on the consumer robotics game I mean they've actually released this thing called the Raleigh r o l l y but it's this crazy robotic speaker that spins around and does all kinds of crazy moves you can blast music to it via Bluetooth or you can sort of program the different dance moves it does or it does its own kind of dance moves based on the music that you've put in there it's just a crazy useless Whimsical and yet beautifully engineered very Japanese product and speaking of whimsical and beautifully engineered uh as you were telling me earlier in Japan you'll have Boutique designers with gadgets that are you know similar to Boutique Boutique fashion houses in New York um and you brought some stuff along this is a retro alarm clock from this company called called amadana which is which does you know that comes in various different colors it's just an alarm clock it's just an alarm clock but it's just got a very kind of a retro sort of n early 60s late 50s maybe even a 1940s look but it's still got a futuristic with the with a light up absolutely and it's got this crazy alarm that's it's kind of soothing like a jet setting Brazil even a jet sound it's kind of a loungy 1960s jet has the jet sound J sound yeah and I mean you can get this at the MoMA design store the Museum of Modern Art design store you should be able to get it online there you can also get it at a place called dynamism Doom which is a store yeah there's a guy there Doug Crone who actually started this company he literally you know specializes in bringing very unique Japanese gadgets to the to the international market but definitely to the US market now this is this dog here with a USB connection now this is just basically this is just that is elegant design yeah it's it's yeah it's it's elegant design as you can see but basically this is the only holiday comp you ever need it's or several of these or several of these I mean I should have bought 50 but I only bought three wow it's the humping dog as they call it and uh is that would listen Japanese this is how it's described yeah it's on the packaging that's what it says so that's just useless but it's kind of hilarious it just us uses the USB power to power this uh you know Engineers spent time designing this humping dog I wonder how long they spent and what else does it do it's basically it just sits there basically you know it can go all night you could leave it on forever and the only thing that's kind of a pain is actually pulling it out I'm always afraid I'm going to break it but h i mean obviously this stuff is is in Japan you can get it at that Dynam dynamism Doom uh the rest the O OLED screens the super thin screens are going to be coming to the US in some form at least at CES and right and of course you can learn more about all of this stuff and follow it as Tom posts his Recollections and memories from his trip to Japan on switch.com"

        "transcript": "ok so this video as you see it's part of my attack helicopter God however it's mostly gonna contain some updates as up in the last episode I put up this guide I wrote it down and put it up on battlelog and I got a good feedback but i also got them quite a few things that people disagree with me especially being for the PC side now I'm just going to talk about the discussion we have and talk about some more stuff that goes into spec so it's kind of an update on the last videos and the first thing is the area now I personally love area you're going to see me use it basically every video and I don't want to say it's the best thing however it fits my fly style as I like to know when Jets are going for me I like to know what is shooting me if I get hit and especially for flag without a pilot that isn't a chat and is helping me out warning me I need every door to to to spoil me those targets what I also do is I maneuver sometimes like I fly below here to helicopter to outfly him try be not seen any more and stuff like that can help me and especially area makes it a lot easier for me to fight these choppers afterwards if I dive down below them and stuff like that so that's basically why i like his air raid are no besides that you completely free to choose whatever you want i like to go easy n because it's just way stronger and the guided missile or the TV metal for the gander now another thing that is um has been discussed quite a bit is the lord of the laser painter for the pilot and the guided-missile for the gander now there is one great advantage this has and today i had a battle i hadn't won we won against not a pilot and it was a great match i guess so thank you mexican for playing with me there i got my ass handed to myself a little bit but anyway I was still hungover from from yesterday buddy I'm not gonna make any excuses you really feel very well and what I have realized is that in Ethel's of good attack helicopter pilots you're not going to use the heat seekers too much because the pilots are going to try stay below radar and laser painter helps you here to get those choppers that are below radar especially after flying backwards the missile will usually hit so it is very useful if you face a good pilot that knows how to use radar the below radar stuff so that you can don't get it now there's one sacrifice and I do not as aware as you are with for example a radar however if you know like to spawn times or if you're a jet pilot up this is definitely a very good no doubt so um in summarize to summarize it if you're fighting a jet pilot sort of not a jet pilot a helicopter pilot that knows how to fly below radar this is actually going to be a very good choice unless you have like a change by the packing you out but you don't really need it but um besides that I would say try it out if you want to both mad Maggie was my body and competitive pilot for call your shot and real reckless who is competitive pirate for chain reaction uses loadout specifically to dominate the dogfights so I'm that's been it now there's one big thing I'll see to talk about and that is the differences between PC and console no that's a something that has been talked about quite a lot and what I've heard is that on PC there's one big difference in chopper dogfights and that is the TV mess I'll a go tally copter team on pc works at the TV mess island dogfights this means as it's a lot easier to control on PC you can actually decide on who's the winner of a dogfight of the TV mess now for me this doesn't work none of my garnish is able to use it correctly not because they're bad but simply because it's so extremely hard to use a console and this makes of Korra change your loadout because what it makes it makes chopper chopper dog fights a lot faster so you're not gonna need a radar for example which means you can switch it out and there is two things that I've been told here and the first one is to use guided so this is because on PC the maps are a special conquest large are there's more vehicle study a gun and the guided-missile helps the pilots take out da a gun and take on the vehicles that are down there so this is also been contributed to my trip in a threat and that's where I'm saying it so if you play on PC this is definitely a great thing to use and it will most likely help you out but um besides that I think it's more useful a piece than a console I myself really don't think about putting out enough damage but um maybe you disagree it might be that I'm just bad and it actually is very helpful then one more thing I have been told is that there's one more set up that I've been suggested by I got in the forums and that is esta pilot using stealth ECM and heat seekers enhance the gunner using TV missile thermal or flares depending on the map and autoloader now I see the point of this as as a pretty set on PC it can be very important to put up more damage and since you don't need a radar because you have the TV missile that can decide about dogfights really really quickly you can use stealth and use also to just do a lot more damage and that is where the guy what a guy a totem to told me so that's also one of the setups that guy had a lot of helicopter kills so I'm guess it's got a good point there give it a try against it some as I said stealth for the pilot autoloader Phil garner ECM for the pilot and addresses up to you of course steven SI les that is for the best choice on pc one by the way bonnet on the gameplay you see here I'm enter spawn and I'm not really a spawn rapist I've been accused of doing that a lot I always try about it but if there is a tank shooting mean I will go for him no matter where he is and if they spawn if they keep on spawning if they keep on taking the tanks to take me out even though they had a base before I will actually go in their spawn and take them out as they provide a threat for me so I Hogan up mad on seeing this is my gameplay I always like to have matches which are on a competitive basis which means the enemy team actually tries killing us so I guess that's it and I'll go for day I hope you enjoy it and the next part is going to be up on monday i guess so one that's also going to incorporate the rest of the gameplay you see here which was again recorded with my gun or spiritual camping so thank you very much and I'm out see ya"

        "transcript": "hey guys john riley bushcraft bums uh i just want to talk a little bit i saw somebody posted on one of the forums about having trouble with a phariseem rod or or a firesteel as people call them and i and uh that's something i see a lot is every now and then you'll see people having trouble lighting different types of things with these type of rods so i'm gonna demonstrate some man-made tinders and then maybe i'll demonstrate i did a video on natural tinders but i'll maybe i'll light up a quick natural tinder if i get a chance but basically what i have here is a uh a classic version of a ferrocene rod this is a very popular this is a swedish army firesteel it's made by a company called light my fire and uh it's just a composite material made of magnesium and other elements it gives good really good sparks when when hit with a sharp surface comes with this striker the back of certain knives will work too and there's a couple of different methods people will use for uh for using these um one method without going to the tinder yet one method will be like uh i see a lot of people do is what they'll do is they'll brace the uh like say this grass is the tinder they'll brace their hand against that and then they'll they'll pull the they'll pull the striker up with the the first team up against the striker like so and that seems like a real good idea at the time because you're not really hitting the tinder but what happens in my experience is as you're providing counter force to the to the rod you'll end up hitting your tinder with with the uh with the with the blade that you're striking with and it's gonna it's going to throw it all over the place so i don't really like that method so much another method i've seen people do is kind of like this flick method well they'll hold it high above the tinder and they'll try and flick it's windy they'll try and flick the sparks down and that'll work well with flash tinder but um the method i like best is the method that where i try to pin the tinder to the ground with the ferrocene rod so if i'm going to do it like on this branch here this piece of bark get my tinder out of the way i pin the tinder to the ground with my rod and then i strike down and i can strike down multiple times on the same tinder same tinder source in an attempt to get it to catch so now i'm just going to demonstrate a couple of different types of tinders i have some man-made tinders here and i also have a little bit of a natural tinder to some simple wood shavings so the first one right here is dryer lint a little bit of dryer lint so i'm going to try that up first and maybe i'll try initially using the flick method and actually works with a flash tinder like that the flick method works because you don't need a lot of heat to get it to combust the drylit works pretty well as you can see i'm getting a nice good burn on that so if you have a dryer a good source of tinder right there throw that in a film canister or something like that and make it happen all right the next version this is a uh again a um a man-made tinder it's a natural material but man-made material but a man-made tender this is jute twine and again this will probably work with that other method too the flick method we start up here and you can kind of really direct where your spark goes once dry catches pretty good stuff now man i always bring man-made tinder with me into the woods and i keep in a little canister with my fire steel and uh i try never to use it basically because this way it'll just extend it i prefer to use natural tinder because the the more natural tinder you use the longer you can keep your man-made tinder if you need it in case of an emergency it extends your your your ability to stay your longevity all right now we kind of have the gold standard here if i can find it is the uh petroleum jelly cotton ball and what this is is just a piece of cotton that's been soaked with vaseline and uh this is pretty forgiving and what will happen is the cotton will ignite but then the vaseline will make it burn for a long long time this is very forgiving so what i'm gonna do is then just uh is i'm going to use that other original method that i mentioned i'll do it right on the grass here where i'm going to pin i'm going to brace my hand on the ground and then draw against it and that i mean that works well for that kind of thing because it's very forgiving right so that'll burn that'll burn for a good long time like if i were to pick this up and prop it on this piece of wood it's going to burn you know you know three or four minutes so you can almost build a fire stages of a fire right around that it's a really great source it's my favorite source of man-made tinder that i bring with me wherever i go it's very reliable it's hard to extinguish as you can see now as we move over to natural tinder this is where we get a little less forgiving and uh maybe i'm gonna transfer this over here so i can demonstrate a little better i'm gonna put this on this board just so i yeah i have a clear plane here so as i was saying before a lot of guys like this kind of like the flick method and it does work sometimes but if you the natural tinder the wood shavings you just need a higher it's got a higher rate of combustion a higher temperature to combust so it's going to have to get hotter before it'll catch into a flame so it's not as forgiving as the flash tenders or as the petroleum jelly cotton and if i do this thing where i brace this what happens is this kind of gets knocked in there and it kind of knocks my tinder everywhere now when i brace the rod down and strike it when i brace the rod down and strike it the um it will knock the tinder also but i get some of it that's compressed down it's going to be a lot more forgiving there we go so for natural tinder i much prefer the uh the pinning down method it is pinning down and multiple strikes it's going to help bring the temperature up to the point where it can combust the natural tender all right so that's the uh that's my examples of how to use a ferrocene rod of different methods my preferred method and different types of man-made tender and using a ferrocene rod versus natural tender all right i'm john reilly this is bushcraft bombs thanks for watching all right so i'm gonna do one more firesteel technique and this is the classic uh disaster scenario what if you only have one hand and you fire steel is the only method of lighting a fire that's your first mistake is having only one method to light a fire but uh god forbid you are injured you only have use of one hand here's how to use a fire steel with one hand i'm gonna take my tinder i'm gonna put on the ground if you have a flat piece of bark or a dry rock to put it on that's gonna be better because you don't wanna get your tinder wet it's like classic old woodman's at woodsman's that age keep your tinder dry and that's uh certainly something you want to do but for the sake of demonstration we don't have to be too crazy about it i'm going to use the small twig to brace the striker up against like so just kind of make like a 45 degree angle out of that and then i'm going to step on it to hold it in place and we really want to get a lot of pressure on there i'm going to try and get my fire steel all the way down to the ground and strike up really try to get as much force as i can in there i take one or two more strikes there we go and we have a flyer that we just made with one hand using a fire steel all right so that's it one couple of techniques of using a fire steel with different types of tinder all right i'm john riley this is bushcraft bums thanks for watching"

        "transcript": "so I wanted to make a really quick video and show you guys a combination that I have been getting tons and tons of requests for it's really easy and the difference with this one is we're going to um apply all of our pigments dry rather than wet and we're not using any Shimmer except for our Splurge cream eyeshadow so we'll go ahead and get started all right so I have got innocent and I'm going to take my brush and just dip it in my innocent I have a little bit tapped out my lid here I if you can see that dip that in there knock off any excess and I'm going to apply this as my highlighter just like I do with sexy in the other videos and I didn't get all the excess knocked off so if you don't you will have it fall on your lashes so just knock it off of there and we're just going to put this on each eye underneath the brow area here and you can come on the inner Corners just to have some highlighter there this is just a a really light color just like a cream color all righty now we're going to take beautiful and I have my I've got um unique's Deluxe brush and we're going to apply that onto our entire lid area so just get a little bit of beautiful on your brush knock off any excess let me Scoot a little bit closer here maybe y'all can see and we're going to apply this to our entire lid area beautiful is a really light brown color it's a perfect neutral it's a a great base color and I do go above my crease area there and we're going to go ahead and go on the other side you can see you can do this really quick and I have to because I I have very limited time I've got like two minutes to make this video but I've been wanting to make this for a long time and so I thought okay I've got like a small window I'm going to run in here in my son's room he's got the best light light and I'm want to make this real quick okay there we go you can see easy enough right okay this is going to be infatuated and we're going to use unique's crease brush and I love this brush and I did not used to use it very much but I have um found a new love for this brush so now I use it almost every day so I've got some infatuated which is our darkest Brown in our matte colors and I'm just going to dip my crease brush in there knock off any excess and then you're going to press the crease brush into your crease area around the outside of you can feel where your eyeball ends so that's where where you're going to put it and you're going to kind of come here to the outer area of your eye and we're just going to make like a rainbow basically a rainbow shape so we're going to push that in and we're just going back and forth back and forth me get a little bit more of my brush all this is doing is giving you that really pretty Dimension that we all love and just kind of gives you that 3d effect hoping you can see that okay and I am kind of getting this right here in the edge I like to make it a little bit darker on the outer edges maybe not so much on the inside but just back and forth back and forth and you can feel exactly where your eyeball is and that's the line that you want to follow going to do the other side here let me knock off that excess back and forth this is so easy you can basically you could even do this in the car don't do it in the car but you could if you needed to all right and again we're going to darken this area right here because that's where just gives you a smokier look on the outside of your eye there make sure they're both good and even come in that's pretty easy right okay I mean literally we're pretty much finished this is a super easy daytime look it's light enough that you can wear it to work it's still pretty enough that you can wear it for night out but we're not quite done we have two more things one is we're going to use unique's liner in proper this is our darkest Brown eyeliner you can use perfect which is our black liner but I really have liked this color I don't think I have ever worn Brown eyeliner in my life and I just ordered this and tried it yesterday for the first time and I love it so it's really pretty I suggest that everybody tries this so we're just going to line our eyes I just go on the top here and I like to stay really close to my lash line area this eyeliner Is Amazing by the way it goes on nice and smooth it is waterproof and it just goes right on I love it and in my other videos y'all have seen me use my pigments as my liners and I do still love to do that but I really love our eyeliners as well it stays on all day just like the pigments do and the lip liners they stay on just as great I have just a little bit of eyes shadow in my lashes there where I didn't knock off that innocent to begin with all right so there you go see that okay so this is is the magic to this look this is one of my very where's my lid I don't know where my lid is this is Splurge okay this is elegant we have we have three colors out we have Elegant dainty and tenacious is the color that we just released May 1st this was our very first color that we released in March it is gorgeous I love it love it love it I love them all but this one is what we're going to use for this look and it's just like a champag tan color so I have our cream shadow brush that I'm going to use and you can see it's kind of spongy in here maybe you can see if I push on it it's like a whipped ey Shadow so I'm getting just the tiniest amount on my brush that might actually be too much I have a really thin layer and I'm going to dab it on just to my eyelid area just where it's light I'm not going to put it up there where the infatuated is I'm just going to put the smallest amount just right there to give my eyes some extra highlight and by the way I don't usually have my mascara done first I always do that last but for time sake I've got it on first so I am getting a little bit on my lashes typically I would not do that I wonder if you can see that in the video good isn't that pretty it is super super shimmery so if you like Shimmer oh my goodness this is like the perfect eyeshadow in the world you can wear it by itself you can put it on your entire eyelid area you can do what I'm doing just like this you can do anything you want to with it it's just so pretty it's really versatile okay let me come in trying to get in a little bit closer here just like that isn't that the most prettiest look ever that's terrible grammar so that's it our look is finished so um if you would like to order any of these products the link to my website is below if you have a unique presenter make sure that you contact her to order yours and another thing you guys are really really great to leave me feedback on my videos and I love to hear from you please let me know give me your

        "transcript": "what's up guys my name is mr. tech beast I'm here bringing you guys a call of duty motor for 3 gameplay with commentary and today I'm going to be burned you guys a USP 45 moab on the map c-town I'm going to be using the support strike back UAV and ballistic vest and for my parks I'm going to be using the scavenger assassin pro and set retro now the reason I'm using salve injure and so I won't run out of ammo and now I can pick up scavenger packs off the ground the reason I'm using assassin is so i can stay off the enemy's UAV once they call a UAV and or advanced UAV and then another thing is why im using sitrep pro is because of my headset and it's very vital towards to your game and that's what I wanted to talk to you guys about today sitrep pro vs dead silence in headset so first of all let me go ahead and talk about sitrep pro vs dead silence / sitrep pro lets you hear enemy footsteps two times as louder and then sitrep pro against the dead silence just lets you hear that silence not two times louder just you can hear dead silence sitrep pro is a very vital part because you can hear enemies walking from a mile away especially having a headset or surround sound speakers in your house you can really hear people walking up on you if you have sitrep pro and that silence / it just solid 20 footsteps so you can sell nor a little bit but it's not it's not nearly as good as sitrep pro so first of all a lot of you guys probably wondering how do i get pistol only mobs well you just have to concentrate and you have to believe in your trigger finger so when I engage in close and close engagements with the enemy like right here i'm using my headset in the UAV to my advantage and go ahead and knife that guy instead of shooting them but yeah so once you on sitrep you can hear people walking from Amell away and whatever like that and when you're using a pistol you got to make sure you have a pretty decent trigger finger and leave a comment down below I want to know your trigger finger speeds because I know some people out there got trigger fingers like modded controllers and that's pretty crazy but yeah so when you're using the trick pistol make sure you have a really good trigger finger or I really don't recommend using a pistol or mk14 in that nature so now let's go ahead and get to the second topic of the video headset a headset is I think one of the most vital parts of your gaming setup besides your controller and television I think your headset is one of the most vital parts because it helps you you can hear different dynamics of the game and it helps you win those gun fights before you even can see him so like my boy Green Goblin said you can hear people walking around the corner and you can just go ahead and lay prone and just pick up the easy kill and right here this is where my trigger finger went to work on that kid and I don't see how I got a headshot the headshot multiplier and model for three is so broken but yeah guys you want to use your headset to your advantage the headset is so vital because of how dynamic different dynamics of the game that lets you hear so once someone's walking up around the corner or something you need to rush them if you can hear multiple footsteps I recommend just laying perm but if you hear just one person walking around the corner go ahead and engage in that gunfight you can go ahead and jump shot them or drop shot them which one ever you like best I think jump shouting around the corner is pretty good because the enemy doesn't expect it and a lot of time noobs they're aiming at the ground anyway so if you jump up in the air they have lesser less time to react towards it and when you're using a headset you you really have the advantage over the enemy because if the enemy doesn't have a headset and you don't have on dead silence or even sitrep they can't hear you but you can hear them even if you don't use sitrep pro you can't you still can hear the enemy like when I'm using dead silence and search and destroy I still can use hear the enemy but when you're using your headset I recommend you using sitrep pro back in black ops it was called ninja pro which enhance the footsteps on the enemy so if you get a headset be sure to you set retro not dead silence that Tyler's just solid says your footsteps and sent reproduce makes enemy footsteps two times lighter if they had that silence is just you can hear them so I hope you guys enjoyed this pistol only Moab be sure to leave a comment down below and this is part of the the be challenges the comments should be on the screen right about now and this is was part of my de beast challenge somebody left the comment said USP silence and I was already going for

        "transcript": "hey it's Jared here and welcome to the intermediate drumming warm-up now this is a f minute warm-up and if you haven't checked out the beginner one you can go ahead and click the link below or you could also move on to the advanced one if you like now this is going to last 5 minutes and it requires that you actually have a practice pad and a pair of sticks or you are ready to go with your hands on your legs and practice along with me it's very very important if you don't do that your whole computer will explode and uh the internet will stop working and it'll cease to exist for you so I really hope that you actually practice along with me and use these videos to get better okay so we're going to go through five different exercises for 1 minute each approximately 1 minute each now it's going to start simple but it's going to get more challenging as we move on and so watch out for that now we're going to do this all at 100 beats per minute okay so here we go starting with exercise one let me just get this timer 1 2 3 three four singles now this is like really good stuff just to do before you uh you know start practicing really get into the the nitty-gritty of whatever you're working on whatever book you're working out of or any complex things that you're working on it's also great before you like go on to play a gig or something just to get your hands warmed up get you developing a really good sense of time now you notice I'm trying to do a medium full stroke roll roll okay so I'm not hitting the sticks down and then pulling them up I'm not doing everything I'm doing half the work the sticks are coming up on their own all I'm doing is pushing them down to create the next stroke okay so you want a very relaxed grip the challenge isn't necessarily speed it's more just developing time developing a good grip and developing good technique okay so we're going to switch to doubles 1 2 3 4 okay so to bounce or not to bounce I would say no bouncing at this Tempo really focus on creating two clean Strokes with your wrists now you want to sound as much like the singles as possible but it's not going to be perfect never is now you probably intermediate drummers are probably like oh this is easy can easily do it this fast but wait till we get on to the next exercises it's a little bit more challenging keep it moving we're going to move on to single parle next 1 2 3 4 again let's just keep it all with the wrists nice loose grip focus on pushing the stick back down but not necessarily lifting it up you want the stick to naturally rebound and to come up on its own keep it moving hopefully you're still with me whether it's on your legs or whatever I want everyone to just kind of challenge themselves might be easy for you might be really hard for you that's all good we're all at different levels and that's the beauty of drumming and learning online everyone's at different levels okay we're going to change to a Swiss triplet played as 16th notes okay now it's a three note rudiment we're going to play it as 16th notes so the turnaround is a little bit funky so watch along on the sheet music and hopefully you can keep up 1 2 3 4 okay let focus on nice clean flams it's hard to talk and do this at the same time okay now we're going to switch one 2 3 4 flam accent played s6th note with a funky turnaround again kind of a p flfa turnaround okay we'll end and one 2 3 [Applause] 4 great so I hope you enjoyed that now if it was too fast especially closer to the end with the last two exercises go and check out the beginner video the link for that is right below and once you've kind of got it at this Tempo feel free to move on to the advanced warmup and uh it's much more challenging same exercises but a faster Tempo um and so you kind of use it to maybe challenge yourself and say I'm going to get up to the advanced Tempo and I'm going to play along with Jared for the five minutes with no mistakes and then kind of grade yourself and so if you were to grade yourself on this lesson on the intermediate warm-up you playing along with me what would you give yourself out of 10 okay go ahead and post it in the comments below I know for me actually talking and doing this stuff is really hard especially the last two and so I would give a lesser grade because I had a uh I was struggling to talk and play at the same time and I felt my brain telling my hands to stop and uh it was still a lot of fun and I know I need to continue to push myself and get better at just playing it without having to constantly think about it all right so thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video [Music]"

it's on sale right now for $7.99 it's going to go up to 10 bucks they say so $9.99 coming up soon uh so basically what you do is you go in and you get a picture so let's actually pull one in from my photo library here um let's pull in my godson we love to play with him so we've got it here and now you've got your palette so uh it's going to go and it you can you could set it to do some crazy things or whatever um I just want it to uh I don't I don't necessarily sometimes you just don't really know what to expect like basically it went and did this kind of artistic effect I can adjust my brush size and I could start to paint back uh uh detail and brush strokes but you've got to kind of be careful F how you do your brush Strokes because it's actually kind of acting like you're painting so it's moving pixels around in the form of a brush stroke which is really kind of nuts uh and then it froze so let's open it back up again and uh it launches the same picture that I had up um so see basically up here you can get rid of or bring back uh see let's get a different tool let's let's play with the Eraser a little bit and we're erasing away um the brush Strokes so if you don't like what you've came up with it's like almost non-destructive you can play uh you can just Erase Away what you had there okay come on give me my tools so You' got the hand tool which typically you know moves around the image of course um you've got your airbrush tool here and now we can airbrush over uh and bring back some uh detail on that image so what's really neat is that it's there's a lot of other apps out there which actually let you um manipulate the picture you know dragging pixels around and stuff like that but this actually lets you take a brush tool or an airbrush or something like that and paint your pixels back so it's kind of the opposite um so down here you've got you know you've got your different tools you've got a airbrush pencil uh brush you can kind of add some cut marks um see I'm not a while ago I decided being an artist is something that I'm never going to be able to be so I'm look at froze again um so I I don't know a lot of what some of these uh technical terms are but um those of you that are artistic and have taken some art classes before are going to understand this stuff um a lot more so but what's really cool is that it gives you a lot of stuff that you can do to these images I'm just you know totally messing up this image but those of you who understand this a little bit can actually come in here and really do something cool so um got some different textures also that we can go and apply to images which is uh is just really cool some of the power that this application has uh for manipulating images right inside your iPhone which is is really cool so oh it looks like it froze again so we're having a little bit of issues with some freezing on this app but uh it's it's trying to do a lot at once I mean I've I've been running my iPhone all day haven't reset my iPhone in a couple of days so it's probably just running out of memory because I'm doing so many things at once um and haven't saved the image of course so when you're done you start to build up your gallery which it gives you a really cool background so that you can have your gallery uh prints up on display um you can edit the hit edit and delete it um out of your gallery if you'd like or you can go and add another um another image as well to your gallery and then when you're all done you have some options here uh to clear or export your photo or you can even just completely undo and go back to the original photo that you started out with and then start over again um so it's really cool so I could just go to clear painting here and then it gives me a warning and I'll just go to clear and be done with it um so really neat some of the things that this app does uh if you are into being artistic and you want some functionality and some fun that you can have with your iPhone or your iPod Touch um then I would recommend this application um like I've always said in many other times sometimes the freezing is not necessarily the application's fault it's uh a lot of times just an issue with the iPhone or the iPod Touch I know a lot of you experience stuff like that too so um just because I'm having some freezing here just just understand that this app actually does save your changes and brings you right back where you were even when you have an issue of the application freezing uh which is pretty good not a lot of apps do that so $7.99 it's a a little more uh expensive as far as um image manipulation tools go for the iPhone and the iPod touch but it's really cool and I think for those of you that are artistic and really like to have fun with your photos it's a good investment so go over to the iPhone app podcast at iphoneapppodcast domcom and go to artist touch the review for artist touch and underneath the video you can click on the iTunes link and purchase this app for $7.99 godaddy.com is our sponsor you can get 10% off your entire order by entering coupon code iPhone or get.com domain names for 749 entering coupon code iPhone

        "transcript": "what's up guys Bo 96hd here we're back with another squad builder for you today h today we're doing an MLS team not something that you've seen much around YouTube this year so I decided uh look at what team I could build and see how nice it would be anyway it's a very very nice thing to play with it's a 3421 formation and uh yeah as I said the MLS there's a couple of players in the stand out and there's a few players that you'll never have heard of but in also a very very fun team to play with but before I start the video if you want coins cheap and reliable sellers check out altcoin traders.com come they're not going to let you down so on goals we do have Carlo Kini kind of a banterous keeper as I'd like to call him he can make some amazing saves but you can make such stupid stupid things and I think that's the thing with all Keepers this year so you could put in any keeper you can put in watch your man's name that his an in form Rando yeah you can put in him but could have done for me and I picked him up for 1K or so on the right side Center back you have a helmo h that's even how you pronounce it left side you have win and then middle you have all they sorry I supposed to switch those around but we'll start with Winn over here everybody knows about Winn 93 pce 73 heading M his main stats all having 75 pce 76 defending and 78 hang just an all round tank and U you know 78 pace which is really his assd being 6 foot as well that back three is really really fast and really solid had right mid you have Castillo 90 Pace is his main stat he has 76 dribbling three star Four Star skills and three star week for 5 fo8 picked him up 1.7k which I thought was really decent deal especially because he does have the Four Star skills um zakuani on the left with three star skills this F 87 pay 74 dribbling picked him off for 1,000 coins decent uh rather mind Castillo but he does the job two mid Center mids first of all you have Beckham the MLS version 63 Pace horrible 74 shooting very nice and the 85 pass in his main staff crazy good free kicks uh 70 dribbling and sit and be side tin kahill with a 65 Pace also not the most pest Midfield 89 head in his main stat decent passing as you can see 79 and 75 shooting H so not Midfield and all it's very very fun to play with the two of them work really really well together Beckham and kahill kahill's really good from Corners beckam really does well to play in the likes of the Onre Strikers as you'll see in a minute and Etc ETA they seem to do a really really good job the back three as I said Win just a 90 Pace all for 75 has 78 Cas has 90 Pace zakuani has 87 there's a bit of pace in this team to say the least and right forward you have Landon Donovan 87 Pace 78 dribbling 75 shooting Four Star skills or three star skills sorry four star weak foot 1.6k very very fast decent shot on him and uh really really really nice [\u00a0__\u00a0] right for on him actually he's good dribbling being 78 and he's he's really in here for his Pace at left forward you have theion re 77 Pace 78 shooting 83 dribbling you think it's Irish man I would hate him don't worry I still have a little bit of hatred for him but still a fantastic player IRL and in this game 83 dribblin it's just fantastic one of the best dribblers I've played with 77 Pace he feels a lot more than that with his dribbling St 78 shooting I think he only has some like 802 or 83 finishing in game I can't think but it's crazy this man's known for a finishing excuse me in real life and E just bollocks him up um but he's still an amazing player for skills four weak foot I know I could have put in for on but I've just wanted to have Darren matx as you can see Striker wise um because I think he's as good and I can still get hry in the team because in hry is a striker but matx is class Supply with 92 Pace being his main stat 71 heading um 2.4k three St skills four St weak foot I've never played with such a fast [\u00a0__\u00a0] he is so so so fast really really recommend you try him he's absolutely lighten and fast H being provided by Donathan and hry lot of free Kick there Akers in this team already Beckham kale can whip one into your pace in the backline it just has a nice look to it Lads and I think you should try it out in my opinion I really am enjoying playing with it but uh if you have enjoyed the video this far

        "transcript": "I you're watching leap magazine and with me I have no years of budget eshe how you doing Mike hello I'm doing great thanks for having me thank you very much for joining us um I'm just gonna jump right into it you guys have had some fairly rough matches but specifically this last one you are actually doing okay I mean you you started out the fights are okay you traded fairly evenly and then one mishap on the topside kind of threw you off track what happened actually today the first two games were kind of stumped and I think it was under one hand because we played against three like the best teams from the world and the plate are like team compositions that we used to play like in month ago two months ago we didn't really adapt to the meta and too aggressive play styles that these things have so the truth game today the last game really just went all in and try to pick new stuff like Cassiopeia Diana and I think that we've worked out and helped us get to the laning phase and mid game but then there were just some miscommunications like jungle icing way to way too far like in gauges and stuff and I just threw the game and GG well I was actually going to say because I mean lookin at lookin at I mean youryour Morgana your cash you pay on all these things today if this is the level you can play on you guys did really well like you said yourself you are facing some of the best teams in the world do you think if if you'd have gone all in on some of the earlier games that you might actually have had a better setup because to completely mechanically looking at your games today you guys I mean you you're all right you know what you're doing so do you think you got just got stomped from the beginning and if you'd gone all-in could you have changed that may be so for the first game I think even if we picked like whatever the best team configured I think they still would have lost like a lot because SKT just played way too well like they are classes at rotations and basically everything mechanically think but maybe for a second game if we picked like aggressive comp like this done and stuff I think that we could actually have a chance at beating TSM because the way they played they were like all the time defensive like six versus farming MIT and they were just telling the game and just pushing the sidelines not really doing anything else so I think if we were able to play it like out aggressive them let's say I think we'll have a chance all right I'm with that in mind then speaking of like playing it aggressive for your next line up you're facing arguably the most aggressive team in the world how are you how do you plan and go into that I mean you can't you can't out gress these guys so what's the plan actually we don't really have a planet so I don't know that's not a very good answer um but but but but barring that then I mean you you know for a fact that they're going to go for some some rom you you you might see a nanny but you might see all these things do you have an idea of what you could do to try and counter this stuff yeah of course like we screamed am I think yesterday EDG and I fink the first game we actually it's quite well but josh is like clearly the most aggressive team that's playing here probably as you said so we easily have to go like really this difference if calm that will just stole the game and like defender carries and we can just scare them back or we need to play their game pick the aggressive champions and just do what they do basically maybe maybe we could have a chance if you feel like have a little bit of luck okay well I'm about shopping you do have you do have one advantage going for you and and we saw that right now with the match you just played I mean your opponent's clearly underestimated you they didn't actually take you seriously and you almost did turn it on them a few times you had that really unlucky engaging it was hard to come back from but I mean they weren't taking you seriously so you do have that kind of going for you that they don't know what to expect I mean can you I'm not asking you to reveal your secrets obviously but but you do you think that maybe going full unicorns of love on them like could you pull something crazy and maybe catch them with their guard down maybe but the thing react probably gonna do is just like this last game just go for like aggressive pics and try to do our best okay now obviously being completely new to this you had some some fairly impressive qualifies coming up to this and being the wild card do you reckon that we're going to be seeing more of you in the LCS from now on that's a loaded question because you don't get away with just saying yes I want to hear why yeah actually I think yes because this is our first tournament against teams like this and it's a first experience if you can get a little bit and learn from it then add these things into the practice I think we can we can get on like really high ALCS level it's just we just need a time this is our first experience so yeah for a first time I think you've been doing it fairly I right so far so I'll look forward to seeing your last free game thank you very much for joining us and for the rest of you for more on the mid-season invitational stay tuned to leave my calm you"

of you who don't know we've did a video a little while ago called the obsidian challenge which is a big challenge that cat made I did all of it uh out of obsidian it was really cool it's on the ah Community vids YouTube channel you should go check it out definitely definitely it's really cool so uh we're doing the next one cat and we're doing the diamond challenge that we are the most expensive of all challenges and you made the obsidian challenge I made this one so this one's mine kind of but uh you see we're in this nice flat world here not a lot going on you got some uh cows and stuff and whoa there are a lot of cows there's a lot of cows but look at that thing on the map covers quite a quite a nice section and there it is the diamond challenge this one's all above ground unlike the obsidian challenge which is all below It's cool cuz the OB challenge was kind of based on like kind of Darkness you know mhm and uh this one's I don't know this one's just kind of a mixture of like technology and then it's got kind of Elemental stuff it's really this one's bright it's very bright you don't have to worry about stuff like spawning in in here it's it's bright throughout you can see it's pretty big and uh these are the uh nice little starting houses right below me why aren't they made a diamond because you don't start with diamond you have to earn diamond all you have to do is sleep yeah well you like the obsidian challenge uh there are four different colors there's red orange green and blue each get their own house to start in uh which they all include a bed I like the carpet yeah the carpet's very nice and they each have two uh paintings in it which are all kind of different and uh you have a chest full of stakes because you do a lot of jumping so your hunger bar will go down because you should play this on like normal I think is a good way to play it so to start the game you each go into your at night take a stack of steaks and then sleep and once it passes over to daytime the race begins as soon as you wake up so ready get set go and so you run out it's raining a little bit but it will brighten up just like that and uh this is best to play when it's bright because it the roof is made of glass so here it is this is the first room the jumping puzzle and uh the cool part with these cat is that there's glass on the walls on either sign if you couldn't see and uh so you can see all the other people playing we did notice you falling too I fell twice I fell twice because I suck at this even though I made it uh but I also know which way to go because I made it and uh just you know each room is exactly the same in terms of uh which blocks are where so it's not like equal challenge it's literally exactly the same and each challenge has one of these this uh flip for checkpoint kind of thing so when you flip that this door down here opens so now if you die and respawn back at the bed later in the challenge you can just run through this room instead of jumping all the way up again it's you know it's kind of cool ignore that chest that uh that was there for me so then it says hit the water a nice Arrow made of torches and splash I really kind of wanted you to hit the if you miss yeah it's it's bad news the floor is lava by the way so another jumping puzzle I fall in I think twice again I yet to get through this room jump yeah there's a lot of Sprint jumping you need to do in this you can clear like four blocks with that like right here I fall in again but oh well and uh yeah that room's pretty damn deadly you can see flip twice for checkpoint flip it once flip it twice and there you go there's your checkpoint there turns the floor into obsidian hey obsidian Challenge and uh shout out oh check this place out ready listen I love that sound if you don't Sprint you take way more damage you will take damage but you won't die because you're nice and fed and another flip for checkpoint so you flip that and it opens a door right here behind the dispensers and I no I'll show you where it goes why not see right back out hidden door never saw it coming and uh I got rid of that Arrow I really don't care if you keep arrows or not because I don't give you bows so this one you have to jump this really long jump here and then press this button jump onto that piston diamond block I missed there and quickly jump back onto the next block before it lowers again more of an attempt to jump onto that diamond block see those two are exactly the same this one you have to jump around this you see I missed I missed there so I'll get it on this I I Miss there so I get the I missed there and then there we go there you go so I can fly in this so you know that sign's supposed to say flip for checkpoint by the way also fix that uh you know professional so uh you know luckily I can fly if I couldn't I'd have to swim all the way back and try again sucks but uh if you get past it you flip that you can climb up these stairs the next time you come through if you die and you might die here says watch your step on the sign up there because there is lava so if you're looking at the sign you're going to fall in if you see the lava you might fall in like so bang your forehead on the diamond there you go now this room cat do you want to explain this room this room's awful so basically every one of those plates will shut the door across the way if you touch any of them and it will not open again which you did immediately con the first PL then you have to go around so instead of being able to just jump through which would take you a little less time to get to the last room you have to climb yep and yeah I mean it's it's totally permanent and it sucks this is dizzying how fast that is yeah but I'm going to show you right here that that it is possible to get through that without hitting the place I was just an idiot the first time you know you just look down and you can do it see and it's much quicker than than climbing up and then climbing back down I do a couple punches cuz took like 10 tries so it really isn't necessarily faster yeah and I'm showing you that I didn't rig it or anything because CH closed just from touching a single plate but then you're in this last room where you can grab the Tower of pimps I took one and then put it in the next chest talent talent really got it Y and you just assemble your Tower of pimps here and that's it for the diamond challenge you are so cheating though all right I'm in creative mode so I have four extra blocks look I throw them I don't need them I'm on the real Tower pimps and I'll throw the staks too lovely thank you so that is the diamond challenge uh we have another challenge that's in the making it's coming along quite nicely indeed it is uh we have another challenge that's you know just getting started another one we're planning for we got a lot cat we do we do so uh definitely watch for more friend me on Achievement Hunter Jam 6401 and uh keep an eye out for more of our videos and check back at ah Community vids see you soon see you later yay cat [Music] yay"
