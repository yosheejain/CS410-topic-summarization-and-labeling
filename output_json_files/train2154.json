posted this in another video it's my speed calling machine whole machine um juggernaut machines okay here i'll tell you what this is not from the game i just made this myself infernal bias 2100 um the length for it is it make your gun incendiary rounds and give you more power almost like a pack of punch but oh smaller oh over here is my mystery box we get the death machine and the grim vapor and the scavengers are going to be r11 i got that in the other video my last machine is my juggernaught machine noob okay i know yeah it's kind of small see see a little bit taller than that um yeah i do have to put them you know circling like seat on top of the speed cone machine that little sign right there yeah i need to put that on here not much actually yeah not much suit um just kinda like out of the game just red box now if you guys wanted to uh know some tips and tricks honey buttons to us okay yeah uh you guys wanted to know um some tips and tricks about making machines um oh here's my perks i get that in the other video except this one this one's for the infernal boss sharky didn't work that good okay yeah you want to know some tips and tricks get two boxes like see right here one two and on a recycle day go around your neighborhood and go find a box because i found two of these boxes and i was really lucky too because i just went around i was at the pool so i just found it nine of them see it's just a cardboard box but they were both attached together so it's even better and these these are two boxes you can't really tell well yeah i came right here and i said i need to put a top on it no don't know um if you have noticed on these machines they are no sides like what i mean by sides is um there's no painting on them reason for that no one's really gonna pay attention to that i mean if you can see like no one's gonna in my nazi zombie video which is gonna come up in like a week or two i think i've actually mentioned that last video which was like two weeks ago so i think i said in it that i was gonna be a week later here so it would be going on now i'm not as long as you know but my friend's not here and i may need my two friends to help me with it but no one's gonna come up and in the nazi science video about juggernaut and then look at the side honey buns and mini muffins yeah no one's going to do that no one's going to come up to inferno blast be like look it's brown oh zombies are chasing them not here no this is just fine it's all ready white i hope you want to see how this works i'm incredible at making things trust me i wish so many people could view these videos and see i can see i'm not trying to brag or anything but i do like making stuff you just like anything you just pop up this is a good quality camera oh this was not my last video i'm gonna itch my arm this was supposed to be olympia i bought from the store for like like 12 bucks spray painted it put no set i put 115 on the shelves and and in order i need to fix these like these little bars on top oh yeah um that's my crazy drum set all right super insane drum set i had as much stuff on it okay let's stay on topic is that rainbow oh it's rainbow over there okay so if you guys wanted me to make anything like ailing off the call of duty zombies okay zombies not campaign not multiplayer zombies machines guns like the one waffle ray gun i did make those but my nephew stepped on them and he ruined them and like i got super mad no i thought that was red on the carpet it's just okay yeah please please please please comment like put anything not don't feel like you're you're dumb and somebody's probably are going to put that just because i said don't just like put something like make your own i mean that's a death machine but i made that a long time like two years earlier before black ops came out so earlier than malware for two not even like know what they looked like so i saw it off the terminator so okay um yeah wonder waffle ray gun and somebody actually did put like if you're watching this the guy that put uh dead shot the carry machine um or in with trish good dolls they said something else i forget oh in power box oh yeah that's right um duh i'm gonna make a power box that guy who you asked me to on my video sorry i did not get to the deadshot to carry thing yet because i didn't have the box for it i needed a skinny box it wouldn't work like that i was gonna get one for that but it just wouldn't work so um yeah okay like i said just comment please um i guess have a good day and i'm gonna start on the power box and maybe later i'll show you some of my guns my new guns okay so yeah um see ya please comment let's give one more look at the juggernaut speed cola and inferno okay oh thank you for watching i hope you watch online because i like watching videos like this i look them up on the internet i'm no nerd i just like watching stuff and usually i'm outside okay um see ya"

        "transcript": "hello today's subject is not the Alpha 6000 as a camera but how this camera can be provided with battery power for a longer time it is a well-known issue that the mirrorless cameras are remarkably smaller than the greater slrs or slts and therefore do have smaller batteries which last for a maximum of 2 hours in optimal conditions this this is a battery for the mirorless Alpha 6000 and this is a SLR battery with a difference in size and power unfortunately there is no vertical grip with a battery compartment for the Alpha 6000 yet like there is one for the alpha 7 which is currently recording this video with these two batteries in the vertical grip the runtime of the camera could easy easily be doubled but what is the use of a battery run time of more than 2 hours lately I began to work myself into time lapse and motion time lapse and the time lapse of the sky full of stars is something I'm planning on such kind of time lapse definitely lasts longer than 2 hours and I don't want to interrupt the time lapse to change the battery there is an easy solution if you have a power outlet nearby because there are these AC adapters which provide permanent power to the camera but you have to be really lucky to find a power outlet in the middle of nowhere and the substitute based on batteries is the only solution here these AC adapters have what I call a battery dummy at one end which is connected to the power supply that delivers 7.6 volt which is the same voltage that is delivered by these bigger batteries I use for the LED lamps that are currently providing light for this video set especially if there is no power socket available doing some research in the internet and getting some expertise results in this assembly which allows me to connect the camera to one of these bigger batteries when everything is connected and the polarity is correct this battery lasts for about 4 hours constant usage which might not be enough for a whole night of stars but is sufficient for longer time lapse now as you can see the camera is starting and taking images well and how to support a whole night of time that's then again I got some help from a couple of experts and this is the [Music] solution I used two battery adapters from which I removed the connector plate and created a parallel connection attaching the batteries and connecting the camera with the AC dummy the camera can be switched on and again it takes images I will now start the time lapse app installed in the camera which takes a short moment and as soon as it is started let we close the battery compartment [Music] here the camera starts taking images controlled by the time lapse app two of these batteries now should provide enough power for at least 5 to 6 hours and if not there is one additional feature of this construction the cam the the batteries um can be changed during operation of the camera and changing the batteries one after the other can extend the run time every 3 to 4 hours until all batteries are exhausted now I switch off the the app here so I think the only limit to this setup is now the capacity of the SD card but maybe there will be other solutions to this shortly so thank you for watching stay tuned and byebye"

        "transcript": "[Music] hello everybody in today's video we're going to take a look at the Diane tyan which is the very first model of the Diane series cubes and not a lot of people have seen this or you know even heard about it because they're new cubers but um you know it's not talked about because it is like a really old model and then they came out to goong and they kind of went off that model so what I got with the unboxing was a uh little bag which I don't want and then uh some some stickers and I guess this was their old logo or maybe that's just a tition logo I'm not exactly sure but I'm not going to use those because I don't like them and now comes the cube and uh I'm really curious about this because I heard it's not that great but you know it's their first model and I know what you know the the the ghong and all the new Diane pieces look like so I'm really curious about how this moves and I can already see how blocky it's going to feel um so let's take a look at this this is a corner piece now and it's already assembled and you can tell that you know a usual Dion Cube comes in three pieces and this is really really Square it's not curved it's not shallowed out or scalloped is it's called in these uh pieces here and I guess these uh are caps for it yep so there's caps that go on the side and that kind of reminds me of a Shang shell 4x4 I don't know if their 3x3 do that but I know that uh their 4x4s are capped on the sides instead of on the inside so hopefully they don't pop out let's see here is a edge piece and that just looks like your standard Edge piece and that fits together how here we go so that fits together like this and that's I don't know that's going to be curious I'm not sure how I feel about uh the design but I'm sure that I will know how I feel about it when the time comes because it's put together which is going to happen pretty quick cuz there's not really a whole lot to show you here it's your standard it's it's standard I mean there's nothing really special about it but they made it special by making more and more versions which turned out to be really awesome so I'm going to go ahead and put this together and then let you guys know what I think about it all right so I've had this Cube for a couple of days and I got to say I'm actually kind of surprised I thought that I was going to have to give this cube a bad review and it's definitely not the best in the Diane series don't get me wrong but it's definitely uh it's it's not a bad Cube I mean it it Corner Cuts 45\u00b0 just like the rest of them reverse Corner cutting not so much um and just so you guys see this is the Tian I'm not using like a goong or something and saying it's better than it is but it's it's actually not a bad Cube like I'm hitting sub20 averages and it's the same size as their regular standard cubes there's nothing really new about this the only difference between this and other Dion cubes is that the pieces um you know they're they're single pieces and they're capped on the sides which is different like you just just saw um as far as the feeling of this Cube goes it's it's a little bit clicky um but I usually find that with cubes that aren't Diane like uh if you if you see an alpha 5 there's you know pieces rub against each other and it's because they're not like rounded off like Diane cubes are and um you know for a first model I have to say this is an exceptional Cube I mean this is Diane's first model and uh you know I've heard a lot of people compare this Cube to the vcube 3 and I think even Me Myself and Pi said that uh you know the vcube 3 is better than this but I I got to be honest I disagree and it's not because I don't like V cubes I just think that this is a really good Cube actually it's it's not as bad as I thought it was going to be I'll uh do a little bit of a solve here and I'm not going to time myself or anything just so you can see the Turning of this Cube as you can see it's it's not locking up on me or anything like it's it's actually quite nice o I don't know and then youer so yeah it's it's a pretty good Cube um it's definitely not going to be my main though like like I'll be honest it's not the best out of the Diane series but I'm surprised on how good it is because I've seen some reviews on the internet about it and people are saying it's a piece of crap and it's not good and a lot of other people my Facebook page said that it wasn't going to be good when I said I was going to order it but it's actually really good and I think that that you know if you come from a Diane Cube and then you see this Diane Cube like you I mean you come from like a a later generation like you know a l Hoyer or zansi or even a ghong the second version of course this is going to be bad but it definitely isn't the worst cube out there uh I would say that it's definitely better than a uh let's see a cube for you DIY or something like that that was my first Speed Cube it's definitely better than that um I would say out of all my speed cubes that I have um you know this is definitely it's not the best but it's it's a step below Diane I like Diane the best and then it's a step below all those you know those better Dian I think it's better than an alpha 5 um I do think it's better than a wit long even though a wit long you know it it does corner cut really you know really well as well um I just like the feeling of this it's a little bit chunky it's a little bit blocky I've never actually felt a cube that feels like this and I I personally I don't think that it's that bad of a cube I I kind of enjoy solving with it so anyways guys that's my review I will have a more in-depth review when I do my full Diane series thanks for watching and I'll see you on my next video"

        "transcript": "Isn't it nice to just sit around sometimes and watch a couple of YouTube videos in order to be able to stay on the couch I already showed you in a previous video how we can turn on the lights with the help of useless buttons on your TV remote and this time we are going to expand this idea by building a clap sensitive circuit with it you can easily turn on all kinds of AC appliances with two well-timed claps let's get [Music] started the list of components we're going to need for this builds is quite long but as always you can find all information about it in the instructables article link is in the description the star of the circuits is this electr microphone which uses a dialectric material in electrostatic fields to convert sound into a voltage signal if we power it through a 1 km resistor and use a 100 nanr capacitor on the output we can see that there appear small voltage bursts whenever I clap but the peak voltage is only around 200 M volts now the 80 tiny 85 that I want to use has a 10bit analog to digital converter which can recognize steps of around 5 Ms so it should work but there can be problems with distortions and there are not many voltage steps to program specific patterns the conclusion is that we have to amplify it by using a ne5534 three resistors and a linear 20 kilohm potentiometer we can create this beefed up audio signal with Peaks up to 4.4 volts and a DC offset of around 2.5 volts and by changing the resistance of the poeter closer to 0 ohms the amplification increases we can use this later to adjust the sensitivity of the circuit depending on how far you position it away from your claps now that we've got our signal to work with we can get started with the codes in order to only turn things on with claps we need to determine a pattern we want to work with I went with two claps with a slight pause in between them firstly the microc controller measures the voltage constantly and if a certain high threshold is reached it waits a bit to see whether it settles down to a certain low threshold then it waights a bit more and if another high voltage signal appears it recognizes it as the second clap and the digital pin 3 of the 8 tiny reverse its output State I programmed my 0 tiny with the help of my homemade programming Shield which you can also build very easily by watching the video about it now before building anything permanently it is always a good idea to test the circuits by using LED with resistor on the output pin of the 80 tiny once I was sure it worked with the LED I tried the same setup with a 5vt relay which will later allow us to switch on and off all kinds of AC appliances in combination with a flyback diode and the npn transistor as a switch it worked like a charm the complete schematic for the circuit looks like this and with the help of it I also created this veroboard layout which features the microphone and potentiometer as a breakout so that I can mount them in the top section of my enclosure speaking of the case I went with this not so great looking gray Project Box the only important aspect to look out for is that there should be enough space on the front for the sockets I started the case treatments by determining the middle points of the front front and back panel then I marked the rough outline of my AC input and output around those points and used my rotary tool to cut out the two holes the AC input was a perfect fit which I immediately secured with two more screws but as always I measured the wrong length for the AC output and now there are small gaps next to it and because this was such a stupid mistake I added white silicon to cover those gaps after I'd ruled the whole for the inner metal plates and secured everything with M3 screws and nuts I also determined two spots on the top cover and ruled one small hole for the microphone and one bigger hole for the potentiometer then I shortened the shaft of the potentiometer so that the knob can later sit flush with the surface now that the case is done I prepared A fitting size for my ver board and used my pre-made layout to create the circuits the whole process took me roughly around 30 minutes and after I was done with it I reconnected the external Parts with shielded wire the metal shielding later connects to Earth and prevents distortions of our audio signal through the 230 volts ac but since we cannot power our circuits with 230 volts we need an additional power supply which can deliver us 5 volts and before I start the wiring I drill two holes in the PCB and four holes in the button of my enclosure to secure the boards later on inside the case then I mounted the potentiometer and microphone and use solid 1.5 squ mm wire to connect Earth to Earth one side of the AC input to the power supply and one side to the outlet and the other side of the AC input to the power supply as well and the directional contact of the relay the other side of the contact then connects to the other side of the outlet and the the wiring is done but let me tell you that it can be possible to touch 230 volts directly if you act stupid so don't act stupid after I tidied up the wiring I closed it up and positioned my clap circuit somewhere not too visible and now I can enjoy to turn on all kinds of devices with two claps and it is strangely addicting I hope you

        "transcript": "thank you for watching liking commenting sharing and subscribing right now I received a flood of emails from friends and family members this past weekend uh no I'm finished belching for now I was doing my impression of Bill the belching Gourmet a little earlier but uh that wasn't why I was getting a flood of emails uh I was quoted in a recent AP article which means it showed up on msnbc.com CNN.com and a variety of other news oriented websites that carry AP articles and that was regarding my perspective on Windows Vista how it's still kind of Half Baked and I'm recommending to a lot of people to just wait for what they call service pack one and a service pack in Microsoft's terminology is essentially a Cavalcade of updates whether they're security or stability updates for an operating system and uh like like Windows XP has already gone through two service packs although some would argue that there should have been a lot more service packs issued for Windows XP uh each Service Pack added a different layer of well usability I think uh by and large to uh the operating system that it was intending to patch specifically the largest leap in functionality happened to be with Windows XP Service Pack 2 also known as SP 2 so uh now that being said Microsoft has said that they are going to issue service pack one within the first year of vista's release and that's really what led me to believe that Vista was more I'm not going okay it feels more like beta software than it should be and the fact that Microsoft's issuing a service pack or announced that they're issuing a service pack not long after vista's release uh just vindicates my very belief that Vista wasn't quite ready so we had a a question submitted through the iot widget which is available on live. pur.com that's how you can uh ask a question through video the volume's a little low but I'm going to I'm going to play it back uh just because I'm very very grateful uh that people are submitting questions by webcam uh how you doing Chris I got a question about Vista he's asking about Vista and he keeps looking up trying to find out exactly what's going on with the uh Service Pack releases the great he's looking up by the way because he's got his webcam low he doesn't normally do this so I'm even more thankful that he's submitting a question and I say he because unfortunately I don't have his name so thank you for submitting the question like I said the volume's a little off and I can't seem to adjust it to the point uh where we can hear you ask the question but uh he is specifically asking should he wait for Vista until Service Pack P one is released or is it good to just uh update Vista to service pack one once it's released and if you buy a machine now with Windows Vista pre-installed um yeah you can stick with it uh if you want to put XP on it that's your prerogative however to have XP and Vista Coexist on the same machine you have to install Windows XP first and then install Vista after it for a lot of different reasons primarily because of the way way the bootloader Works in Vista differently than it does in Windows XP however if you still have Windows XP stick with it don't do a thing um allegedly there's going to be the first beta of Windows Vista Service Pack one here in just uh the next few weeks now this is just a rumor but that being said they will hopefully initi initiate that sequence and then of course release uh service pack one within a few months after that likely before the end of the year as my Micosoft had earlier indicated my recommendation uh for this viewer and everybody I'm sorry for freezing you there looking up here wait wait wait okay there we go sorry I didn't mean to have you staring up there he even made reference to it at the end of the video uh so I would say when Microsoft releases Vista Service Pack one then I think I would be more confident or more inclined to recommend that people get Vista over XP a lot of the bugs are just uh I think just detrimental some people blame thirdparty vendors uh I just think that there wasn't a lot of fit and finish uh placed on Windows Vista and like I said everything uh that's happened since I've you know come with to this assessment um has only strengthened my arguments so yeah when service pack one comes out then it's a good time to to likely upgrade to Windows Vista um most likely they will have had a chance to flesh out uh the bugs that have been reported over uh months of users like myself submitting bugs uh and recorded bugs and bugs that they uncover um Vista will be a better operating system I'm sure when service pack one is released what do you guys think is Vista cool for you are you still waiting you still holding out or you on XP or Vista you recommending the same path for upgrading or waiting on upgrading leave a comment followup remark or of course come by the chat room every day someone's got a different question that's related to Vista and certainly we'll do our best to answer them if we do know the answers or if we can try to find the answers for you uh chat room of course if you haven't figured it out by now by the URL that's in every one of these videos is live. pill.com"

Naeem is this a good or bad thing that social media has been able to infiltrate politics social media is a technology and as we know technologies have their good size and the dark sides they're not so good sides so it all depends on users and trying to understand what are the users intentions motivations and intentions it's very important today and so it depends on the users and the forces that are that shaped their motivations I mean from my point of view the the single biggest thing that changes with social media is that social media was effectively designed as a tool for the empowerment of the user and giving them broadcast power and once the individual has broadcast power it tends to change politics and that I think is what we've seen although is it's often said you know social media can bring down systems but it hasn't got any real capability to create something new to replace them which is what we've seen with the Arab Spring and the aftermath in Arab Spring and some ways could have never happened would not have happened without Facebook and Twitter right but neither can a recruiting of Isis in a particular way that it is able to do on social media right I think that's I think on balance that positive the implications are positive but Isis also uses social media very intelligently dr. Nieman is there a responsibility that companies like a Facebook have when they're working in countries that sort of favor oppression that is a very hard question to do it's a it's a it's a difficult question the answer is yes but it's easier said that done on the limits on that are huge and I want to question the notion that without social media the Arab Spring would not have happened the drivers of the Arab Spring were not social media social media amplified it and empowered people and had a huge effect but it was not the main force behind the Arab Spring what do you feel social media has done in terms of changing geopolitics I mean my argument for the Arab Spring was that it might not have had the impact if it wasn't for Twitter as David said social media empowers people and gives them voice and the ability to broadcast views it also lowers the cost of coordinating collective actions of raising money of organizing of energizing protesters and all that but again governments are becoming also media savvy and so we see governments in Iran and in Russia and in Venezuela there are very good at managing social media and in fact are using social media to identify who are the leaders of the process who are the nodes that they have to hit and so social media can be a to liberation technology but it also can be repression technology"

        "transcript": "Hi, I\u2019m Cameron from Kingston. Today we\u2019re going to show you how to install an SSD drive into your computer. Kingston\u2019s SSD Upgrade Bundle is designed to make upgrading from a traditional hard drive to a solid-state drive fast and easy. Before beginning installation, it is important to verify that the SSD provided in the kit is larger in capacity than the \u201cUsed Space\u201d on the system hard drive you\u2019re replacing. To determine the \u201cUsed Space\u201d on your hard drive, boot your computer to your desktop, double-click on My Computer and then single right-click on the C: drive and select Properties. If the \u201cUsed Space\u201d is greater than the capacity of the SSD, you must temporarily move some of your data such as pictures, movies, and music off of the drive to an alternative data source such as an external hard drive or USB Flash drive until the \u201cUsed Space\u201d is less than the new SSD capacity.  After the cloning portion of the installation is completed, these files can be moved back to their original location on the hard drive. Turn off the power to your computer, disconnect the power source and remove the battery pack from your notebook. The hard drive in a notebook is usually accessible by removing a panel from the bottom of your notebook. Remove the system hard drive from your notebook and disassemble the system drive bracket. Next, open the external drive enclosure included in the kit, switch the lock to the unlock position and slide the two panels apart.  To assemble the system hard drive together with the external drive enclosure, align the pins of the hard drive to the SATA connector on the enclosure and push them together until the drive is securely in place. Then align the top and bottom panels of the enclosure and slide them together. To secure the enclosure, switch the lock to the lock position. Next we will install the SSD in your notebook and attach the external drive enclosure. Assemble the SSD with the system drive bracket and insert the drive into the drive bay of the notebook. Using the USB cable provided in the kit, attach the system hard drive installed in the external drive enclosure to your notebook via any available USB port."
