        "transcript": "hey y'all this is chadel from my thrifted closet as you can see from the title below I am here to talk about my top tips for low procity hair I found out I was low procity about a year and a half into my journey for me that was pretty late but there are some women out here who still do not know their lococity and therefore they're not able to take care of their hair as optimally as they would if they knew so I'm here with my top tips so if you're interested in seeing these tips please stay tuned my very first tip is that you want to DC on dry hair you want a deep condition on dry hair there's many there's a lot of talk about whether that is effective or not but I can tell you being a low prosity girl being 3 years into my journey I know that works best for me I remember when I would DC after my shampoo or after my coash my hair would not feel deep conditioned it would feel coated it would feel sometimes even stripped because my hair my strands were packed with water therefore not allowing my conditioner to penetrate into my hair strand and do what it's supposed to do to fortify to strengthen to moisturize so I started dcing on dry hair and it has saved my life I will have another video on dry hair deep conditioning later on but that's something you may want to try it's deep deep conditioning on dry hair that has been very helpful for me is help that moisture to really penetrate my hair strands so deep conditioning on dry hair is definitely my number one tip number two you want to rinse your hair with warm water do not do the Cold Water Rinse a lot of people follow this regimen where they shampoo they condition and then they follow up with a cold water rinse to seal the cuticles because you are low pry your cuticles lay closed they lay flatly you do not need any cold water no cold water to close your cuticles your cuticles are already closed but if you rinse with warm water your cuticles lay open therefore allowing you to then moisturize your hair and seal later on into your routine so do not do not do the Cold Water Rinse use warm water that is very very very important number three and these are in no particular order you want to incorporate heat into your moisturizing regimen therefore you want to use wet heat such as Steam you want to use dry heat such as a hooded dryer or a hot head or a any any kind of heat I use my steamer a lot I sit under my steamer for 20 to 30 minutes I sit under my hooded dryer for again 20 to 30 minutes and that helps the heat penetrate into your hair if you do not have any of these appliances or tools or whatever you can use your natural body heat by using a plastic bag and then wrapping it with u a towel or using a beanie I do that a lot um so that's very helpful for me as well and sometimes I also sleep with my deep conditioner overnight there's also a bunch of controversy around that but that works for me and I do not have problems with my hair um doing any kind of funky stuff number four you want to moisturize your hair on damp or on dry hair do not do not come out of the shower hop out of the shower and then try to moisturize your hair as you see these ladies do on YouTube that is a no no for low procity hair in my opinion you want to let that hair let that water evaporate off of your hair allowing some space some room for your leave in or your moisturizer to moisturize your hair if you if you use a moisturizer or leave-in right out of the shower you have that water layer from your from rinsing out your hair and then you have the leave-in on top of it that leave-in is not getting through because of the water so I definitely suggest waiting 15 minutes to even an hour for your hair to transition into a damp or dry State and then moisturizing your hair you will find that your hair is a lot softer a lot more Supple a lot shinier without moisturizing right out of the shower early on in my journey I wondered why my hair was so damn dry it was because I was following someone else's regimen and not creating my own so you may want to try that if you find that you have dry hair tip number five you want to stay away from products that close the cuticle one of the products that I completely hate is apple cider vinegar Naturals Rave about this but it it does not work for me because it closes my cuticle and my cuticle is already so flat that it just doesn't work for me I know some little procity girls that still use apple cider vineger but that has not been helpful for me at all so I suggest personally staying away from products that close the cuticle aloe vera gel has a low PH so it also closes the cuticle but I find when mixed with other products it is fine for me when I try to use aloe vera gel straight out of the bottle not so much but mixed in with other products I don't have problems with aloe vera gel but ACV apple cider vinegar is a no and my last tip is use products that open the cuticle so that's using any type of alkaline treatment one of the most popular ones on YouTube is the Cherry Lola treatment I've used that only once but I do intend to use it sometime this summer because it helps to open the cuticle it helps to reduce frizz it's also really just an awesome awesome treatment you can use that because it includes baking soda and baking soda helps to lift the cuticle because it is an alkaline product you may just want to do a baking soda treatment so that's baking soda and water you may want to do baking soda mixed with conditioner and all baking soda does is lift the cuticle there's some controversy that baking soda can relax your hair but it can't it doesn't I've used it before in the past on a number of occasions and that has not been my experience so I suggest using an alkaline sh alkaline shampoo an alkaline treatment um and those are my tips those these are the things that have worked for me best I've tried a number of things on my journey but these are the things that can help you get to softer more Supple and therefore hair that retains more length um so these these are my tips I thank youall so much for watching if you are low paracity or if you just have any tips that you want to give to me and some other ladies on this channel other men on this channel please leave them in the comment section below and I will talk to y'all later bye y'all a little closer I to you"

        "transcript": "what's going on guys teamart here and today we are going to be comparing the previous generation of Call of Duty with the next generation of Call of Duty so as you can see we've got PS3 and PS4 gameplay on screen I went through some of the multiplayer maps to try to get a nice diverse group so some inside some outside some jungle some desert some snow you know things like that I just kind of want to show you guys the differences in terms of you know Graphics in between the two games now I keep in mind this is on YouTube so the video had to be compressed and this doesn't really do it justice like I still rendered an uploaded and everything in 1080P there's no color correction or anything like that so you know these are pretty much equal but they're going to look better when you're actually playing on the screen but yeah as you can see I mean the next generation of the game is just it's so much more vibrant the colors are so much deeper there's so much uh more diversity in the colors just you know it just it looks a lot better the textures look more detailed the gun itself looks absolutely Head and Shoulders above the previous version of the gun you can see the the light reflecting off of it a lot better just it looks a lot more realistic and and yeah I think that's one of the main differences between these two generations of games is the lighting is just so much better in the PlayStation 4 version just you know the sun rays coming down and bouncing off the snow or the rocks or whatever it is or if you're on uh prison break you can look up and see the sun coming through the trees and you can see like dust flying around in the air and stuff you know by all means it's not perfect you know this game was still made uh with the the old generation in mind so this isn't the best graphics we can ever possibly get but they're still very very good like it's a huge upgrade over the previous generation and and I think that's pretty apparent but by what you're seeing on screen again you know I don't I didn't put any color correction on either one of these but as you can see the one on the right the PS4 there everything is just so much brighter there's so much more color it's so much more vibrant look at the grass on the right side compared to the left side you know it's not even close so uh yeah the new version of coluty ghost as expected does look a hell of a lot better than the old one obviously there's still more room for improvement we will improve over the coming years but but it just it looks really good so far like I'm interested to hear you guys thoughts one thing I have noticed is that playing on the PS4 enemies seem to pop a lot more like you can see them easier they don't blend in as well with with the gray dull background that that kind of the older generation had so yeah what do you guys think about this PlayStation 3 versus PlayStation 4 gameplay thank you guys so much for watching uh catch all later I got a bunch of great PS4 videos coming out later today and I already uploaded quite a few so make sure you guys check those out if you have not seen them yet but anyway thanks for watching guys catch you all later check out these other two you haven't seen me yet and I'll catch you guys later peace out"

        "transcript": "hey so we're going to be talking about the newest Mac collection today this is there's two parts to this this is the Sharon Osborne and then the Kelly Osborne collection so Mac collaborated with Sharon and Kelly to come up with their own collections so the packaging is mainly the first thing you notice here you've got the Sharon Osborne ones have her signature on them and they also have the red which kind of is like her signature red hair the Kelly Osborne ones have Kelly signature and then they are sort of a lavender color like Kelly's hair so that's kind of how you can tell them apart and I really like the color of Kelly's collection in particular I think it's a really interesting like lavender grayish purple shade that is really cool and it has like a frosty element which is nice so both collections come with a variety of different products uh both the Kelly and the Sharon collections have a four quad eyeshadow and then they have some lip products some blush some brushes and different eye products so I'm just going to go through what I have here I have a lot more of the Sharon stuff than the Kelly but we're just going to break it down and I'll start with the Sharon so first thing here is the eyes Shadow quad this is called The Duchess quad and it's got the four eyeshadows it's got her signature and then it is a bright plasticky red it also has a magnetic closure and I really do like that it is see-through up at the top and so the colors we have here starting at the top left is sweet eyes and this is a light golden nude and then we have sexy eyes which is a warm bronze and then fem fatal which is a golden brown then Imark which is the dark reddish brown and then all the eyeshadows here are all of a different texture as well which is always a nice thing I really like when you have a variety of textures to play with when it comes to a palette so you can really get get a really nice look that isn't all one finish so it doesn't feel flat and this palette is nice too because you could really go for a variety of different looks from something that is light and day and wearable to something that's a lot more Smokey and sultry okay and so I just went to go show you guys this and apparently it was completely crashed so this was refresh I just made a huge mess all over my shirt and everything so this was a mineralized skin finish Duo that apparently I wanted to show it on the video before I swatched it but it just cracked all over the place so that's just going to be a big mess I need to clean up really quick all right so now that I've cleaned all that up the next thing I have to show you is the blush so this is called peaches and cream and this is beautiful so it's a midtone rose and it's a satin finish and so then lastly I have some of the lip products here so so the first things are these patent polish lip pencils these are super chunky they kind of remind me you're going to stop nope stop moving there we go they kind of remind me of the tar lip pencils because they're super chunky and then you can just twist on the bottom to make them go up and down and so the first color I have here is called french kiss and it is described as a warm caramel and and then the next color here is called innocent this is much more up my alley so this is a nude beige and it's probably something that I would end up just keeping in my purse because it is a really nice creamy nude color the last thing I have is one of the lip glosses so this is called bow I believe sorry if I'm saying that wrong it's this is described as a soft Rose and so if you've used Mac lip gloss you know exactly how this is it is super shiny and'll last a long time but it is very sticky so now we're going to talk about the Kelly Osborne products and the first thing is the eye products that I have the first one I want to talk about is this big giant liquid liner pen so this is called the jumbo pen ultimate and it's in Rapid black it's got a big marker like tip going on and then you can see when it is a applied you can get some super super thick lines or relatively thin ones if you use just the tip I think this would be a good product to have on hand if you like to do thick liner otherwise it might not be a good buy because it really really does thick lines and then the last product I have for the eyes is smolder which is just a creamy black and this is not a new product so most of you have probably used this one and then finally I have two of the four lipsticks here so this first one is called strip poker and it is a light nude and is a matte and so here's what that looks like on my lips and this one is called dodgy girl and it is a lavender it looks a little dark on my camera because I don't have my lighting right there we go and it is also a matte and so here's what that one looks like on my lips so that is all I have for this collection let me know if you guys are planning to pick this stuff up it is in stores today and if you are picking up something else from this collection that is worth checking out also let me know and I'll see you [Music] soon"
